The past few years have been a whirlwind for Prince Harry. After meeting American actress Meghan Markle in 2016, the two started dating and eventually married in 2018. However, many observers believe their relationship has led Harry to make poor choices that have severed ties with his family and British heritage. Meanwhile, Meghan seems focused more on pursuing her own ambitions instead of supporting her husband. 
### A Troubled Start
When Harry first started dating Meghan, those close to him worried about her past psychological issues and manipulation tactics. Despite [severe mental health problems](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/alberti) and a history of **studying Harry extensively to charm him**, he was too needy and eager for love at the time. Their relationship progressed quickly and many thought Harry rushed into marriage without properly vetting Meghan.

### Love Bombing and Manipulation  
Once married, Meghan's true colors began to show. She worked to isolate Harry from his loved ones through **love bombing and emotional manipulation**. Meghan wanted Harry only for his royal title and assumed wealth, not genuine love. Through **calculated acts** like wearing Diana's perfume, she stoked Harry's ego and deep-seated need for maternal approval. But her affection was never sincere - once married, Meghan treated Harry with contempt.
### Clinging and Criticism
At their first public appearance together after marrying, Harry appeared visibly uncomfortable with Meghan digging her claws into his arm. During a speech where Harry sought Meghan's approval, she criticized his performance was as "not good enough", showing little care for boosting her husband's self-esteem. Harry was left twisting in the wind, unsure if Meghan's next move would be affection or abuse.
### Financial Failures and Broken Promises  
Harry felt he had let Meghan down by not having the billions she expected from the royal family. When Meghan told the Queen she would only marry Harry for $1 billion, it was no joke - she wanted extreme wealth. But Meghan did not properly research Harry's actual finances. As a result, she grew dissatisfied with their lifestyle. Meanwhile, **promises of fame and fortune in America proved empty**, leaving Harry trapped in a loveless marriage.
### Abandoning Family and Heritage
Despite being loved by his relatives, **Harry cut off all family and friends** at Meghan's insistence. She sold him on the idea of an "American royal" lifestyle that did not match reality. As a result, **Harry severed ties with the only support system** that could help him leave Meghan. Now entirely dependent on his manipulative wife, Harry made the life-altering choice to leave Britain for California, severing ties to his homeland and culture.
### Damage Control and Lies  
As their marriage unraveled, Meghan pushed Harry to **"throw gasoline" on the royals** through bombshell media interviews. Their Oprah special was full of **unverified accusations** meant to destroy William and Kate's reputation. Meanwhile, Harry appeared visibly uncomfortable, under Meghan's control. When the Finding Freedom biography and Harry's upcoming memoir backfired, Meghan sought fresh attacks, not caring **how much damage is done to Harry's image and relationships**. 
### An Empty Future  
Seeing Harry as little more than a means to an end, Meghan will grow tired of him as his usefulness fades. Without his family as an escape, Harry appears powerless to leave the volatile relationship on his own. **Trapped by his own choices**, he faces a lifetime of **estrangement, ridicule and unhappiness** - all because of his poor decisions made while under Meghan's manipulative spell. As for Meghan, she will continue chasing fame and fortune, leaving the collateral damage of Harry's ruined life in her wake.
