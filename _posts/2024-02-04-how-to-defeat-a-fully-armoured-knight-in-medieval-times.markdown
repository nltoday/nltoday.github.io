## Strategies and Tactics
Armour technology during the medieval period evolved significantly over time. The type of armour a knight would wear depended greatly on the era. Earlier on, mail was more common, sometimes supplemented with plate sections. Over time, full plate armour became standard for knights starting in the late 15th century. 
This article will explore various strategies and tactics that could be used when facing off against a knight in [full plate armour](https://yt.io.vn/collection/abbate) - the strongest and most protective suit available at the time. It's important to understand that defeating a knight in full plate would have been extremely difficult and required considerable skill, training or tactical advantages on the part of the attacker. Let's explore some of the options available and their pros and cons.
### Blunt Force Trauma 
One approach would be to use weapons designed to inflict **blunt force trauma**, such as a poleaxe, warhammer or mace. While the armour may hold up well against piercing and cutting attacks, repeated strikes from heavy blunt weapons could potentially cause fractures and broken bones underneath. **Two-handed poleaxes** in particular would have been very effective due to their long reach and heavy striking head. However, landing accurate hits against a highly skilled armoured opponent would still have been no easy task. Considerable strength and stamina would also be required to bludgeon an armoured man to death in this way.

### Targeting Vulnerable Areas
If **blunt force attacks** failed or were not possible, targeting the few vulnerable gaps in a knight's plate armour could offer an alternative approach. Key targets may have included the armpits, inside of the elbow, groin and gaps around the helmet. However, these tiny vulnerabilities would have been incredibly difficult to exploit in live combat against a wary opponent. Extra layers of mail, padding and plate overlaps also helped to reduce already limited vulnerable zones. Achieving a precise strike would have required immense skill with weapons like daggers or half-swording techniques. And the knight, having trained for years in armour, would be well aware of his own weaknesses and adept at defending them.
### Superior Numbers and Firepower
Going up against a knight alone in single combat would have almost guaranteed defeat for most armoured or unarmoured opponents of the era. A more viable tactical approach may have been to simply overwhelm the knight using numerical superiority or ranged firepower. **Swarms of arrows** or crossbow bolts launched from a safe distance could potentially penetrate weak points in the armour through sheer force of multiple impacts. However, outcomes would still have been unpredictable depending on range, type of projectiles used and the knight's own skill and suit of armour. Low-density swarms may have had little effect, while concentrated barrages could overwhelm even the best steel plates with enough luck.
### Wrestling and Depriving Air 
If the situation called for close quarters combat, wrestling techniques may have offered some advantages against a knight's armour. While the armoured opponent would be nearly impervious to strikes, grappling allowed targeting the vulnerable areas like the armpits, neck and helmet gaps more easily. With training, it may have been possible to wrestle a knight to the ground where his heavy plate and enclosed helmet could transform into a liability, **depriving him of air.** However, knights themselves were renowned fighters and heavily physically trained from an early age. Overpowering one in melee would still have required immense strength and grappling abilities. And any mistakes would have been swiftly punished by a knight's own wrestling skills.
## Strategies in Summary
In summary, while a capable warrior may have had some strategic options for defeating a knight in full plate armour through perseverance or tactics, it would have remained an extraordinarily difficult challenge in nearly all situations. Very few opponents of the era could reliably triumph over a properly armed and armoured knight without significant advantages in training, numbers or equipment. Superior weapons like poleaxes offered the best individual chance, while swarm tactics, ranged barrages or wrestling held additional risk-versus-reward potential. Overall, a knight's heavy plate suit achieved the aim of deterring all but the most skilled or tactically advantageous enemies through formidable protection and fighting ability.
### Further Tactical Considerations
Aside from direct combat methods, some additional tactical approaches against knights warrant consideration. **Capturing a knight alive** through tactics rather than outright defeat in battle allowed potentially stripping them of their plate armour, leaving them vulnerable to execution without its protection. Alternatively, **luring knights into terrain** where their heavy armour became more of a hindrance than an asset, such as bogs or swamps, could potentially turn the tables through immobility and fatigue rather than breaks in their steel shells. While dishonorable, poison was also a stealthy option for assassinating mounted knights whose armour offered near-full protection from open attacks otherwise. Each approach came with ethical and practical challenges but demonstrated the myriad creative tactics opponents employed to overcome knights' mobile walking fortresses when direct combat proved untenable. 
### The Evolution of Effective Countermeasures
Over time, innovators developed new weapon types and tactics aimed specifically at defeating plate armour more reliably on the battlefield. As full plate suits became standard in the late 15th century, polearms saw widespread adoption and change. While halberds and voulges offered impressive reach and utility, the bill hook emerged as a specialized anti-armour weapon. With its curved and perforated bill, it threatened to snag and tear through plate more effectively than earlier polearm designs in a single powerful swing. Firearms also grew increasingly prevalent on later medieval battlefields, gradually replacing polearms as plate-piercing weapons of choice by the 16th century. Cannons and later hand cannons allowed attacking armoured opponents safely from a distance, circumventing armoured defences entirely with explosive projectiles. This new range of anti-armour weapons spelled the beginning of the end for the age of mounted chivalry on European battlefields.
