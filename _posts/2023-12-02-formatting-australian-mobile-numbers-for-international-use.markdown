## How to Convert Australian Mobile Numbers for International Calling
Australian mobile phone numbers follow a specific format that makes them easy to identify starting with 04 or 05 and 8 additional digits. However, when calling from outside of Australia, the format needs to be adjusted. Let's breakdown how to properly convert Australian mobile numbers into the international format.
### Removing Leading Zeros
Australian mobile numbers start with 04 or 05 but the leading zero is only used for domestic calls within Australia. When calling from another country, you'll want to remove this leading zero.
For example, a mobile number like 0411 222 333 would become +61 411 222 333 when calling internationally by removing the initial zero. Removing the leading zero ensures the number is recognized correctly overseas.

### Including Australia's Country Code
To indicate you're calling to Australia, you'll need to include Australia's country code which is 61. The country code should come immediately after the plus sign at the beginning of the number.
### Full International Format
Putting it all together, a full Australian mobile number in international format would be:
+61 4 11 222 333
The plus sign shows it's an international call, 61 is Australia's country code, and 4 11 222 333 is the local mobile number with the leading zero removed. Following this format ensures your call connects properly when dialing from outside of Australia.
## How Mobile Networks in Australia Handle International Calls  
When an international call is placed to an Australian mobile number, the networks have protocols in place to route the call correctly.
### International Trunk Prefix Recognition
Australian mobile networks are designed to recognize the international line prefix, usually indicated by a plus sign. This tells the network the call is coming from overseas rather than domestically.
### Appending Country Code  
Upon detecting the international line prefix, the network will automatically append Australia's country code [61](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-funny-saint-bernard-lover-graphic-women-girls-st-bernard-1) to the beginning of the dialed number before routing the call locally.
### Routing with Complete Number
With the country code appended, the network now has the 10-digit number it needs to properly route the call to the destination **Australian mobile subscriber**. The call is then connected as if dialed from within Australia.
## Additional Tips for Using Australian Mobile Numbers Internationally
### Store Numbers in Contacts as E.164 Format
For ease of use overseas, it's best to store all Australian mobile contacts in your device using E.164 format. This standard format ensures the number is always recognized internationally regardless of your location.
### Check Carrier's International Rates
Be mindful of roaming charges if using your own device overseas. Check with your home carrier for rates to Australia. Using VoIP or messaging apps can help reduce costs versus cellular.
### Consider Texting Over Calls 
Texting is generally cheaper than calling when roaming internationally. SMS is a reliable way to stay in contact with Australian mobile users if keeping costs down is a priority.
### Mobile Coverage in Australia
Australia has **excellent mobile network coverage** across major cities and most populated rural areas thanks to investments from the big three carriers: Telstra, Optus, and Vodafone. Reception is quite reliable for contacting friends and family.
