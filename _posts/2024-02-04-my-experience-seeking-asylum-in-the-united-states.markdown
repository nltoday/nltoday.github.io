## Arriving at the Border
I came to the United States seeking asylum after years of persecution in my home country. When I arrived at the port of entry in Niagara Falls during the Obama administration, customs officials from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) quickly contacted the embassy of my home country. They made me wait for hours until nightfall before informing me that I had two choices: return to my home country where I faced danger, or go to jail as New York did not have an immigration detention center. Unable to return home, I was arrested and transported to jail.
### [Physically and Psychologically](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/allain) Traumatizing Entry Process  
At the jail in Chautauqua, the guards ordered me to fully undress and **squat and spread my buttocks** so they could inspect me. They made demeaning comments as they watched, violating my dignity. As a asylum seeker, I faced abuse, harassment and isolation from both the guards and other inmates.

## Detention Under Harsh Conditions
I was imprisoned with dangerous criminals though I had committed no crimes. The food and water made most inmates ill, and I was purposely placed in the coldest cell. The guards denied me adequate clothing and bedding, leaving me in a constantly freezing state. They forced me to take cold showers daily. Without access to my contacts or money, I could not make phone calls to lawyers or advocates for help. The jail ignored all of my requests and complaints.
### Lack of **Due Process** and Communication
During my nearly three months of detention, no one informed me of any hearings regarding my asylum case. Immigration officers spoke regularly to other detainees but avoided me, leaving me in legal limbo. I had no way to communicate my circumstances to the outside. 
## Transfers and Ultimate Deportation
After contacting the State Department about the abuses, I was transferred to a federal prison with better conditions. However, I was soon sent back to undergo the traumatic entry screening again. Ultimately, immigration authorities deported me without ever providing a hearing on my asylum claim.
## Seeking Justice and Change
My harrowing experience highlights the lack of **humane treatment** and due process for asylum seekers under the current system. No one, especially vulnerable people fleeing serious harm, should have to endure such abuse and rights violations when seeking international protection. I hope that sharing my story brings needed reforms to establish fair and compassionate asylum procedures in keeping with America's values of refuge for the persecuted.
