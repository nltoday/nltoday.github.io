## Understanding the Exam Pattern
The first and most important step in preparing for the SSC CGL Tier 1 exam is to understand the exam pattern and the type of questions asked. The Staff Selection Commission (SSC) conducts a Computer Based Test (CBT) for the Tier 1 exam through a third party agency. According to Santosh Kumar Yadav's insights on Quora, there are some key aspects about the SSC CGL Tier 1 exam pattern to keep in mind:
### Focusing on Recurrent Question Topics 
A major area assessed is the candidate's [general awareness and current affairs](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cow-funny-animal-cute-rainbow-graphic-for-men-women-and-kids-v-neck-t-shirt/women&). However, **only the current events of the last 3 months** should be focused on. While**general studies questions are unpredictable, previous years' papers can give an idea of commonly tested static GK topics**.

### Mastering Logical and Abstract Reasoning
**Reasoning ability is an important section** that evaluates one's problem-solving skills. SSC often repeats similar logic across questions, so **thoroughly practicing past year reasoning papers** published by the commission's third party agency can help tackle upcoming questions effectively. 
### Improving Reading Comprehension Skills
Another emphasis is on **English comprehension through long passages**. The **passages are getting lengthier each year,** so strengthening reading speed through daily newspaper reading is vital. **Focusing on one reading per day from The Hindu or The Indian Express newspapers is recommended**.
### Reinforcing Calculations 
For the quantitative aptitude section, **speed and accuracy in calculations is key** rather than attempting difficult questions. **Mock tests are invaluable for improving calculation speed** and discerning which questions to skip or solve within the allotted time.
## Resources for Subject Preparation
A mix of books, mock practice, and online content can help prepare effectively for different SSC CGL Tier 1 exam sections. Here are some top recommended preparatory materials:
### Books for Mathematics
The **Rakesh Yadav previous year question bank** is best to get familiar with commonly tested math concepts and approaches. For fundamental concept learning and practice, **Sarvesh Verma's Quantum CAT** book followed by **Gagan Pratap's PDF** (excluding geometry) are excellent. 
### General Knowledge Study 
For static general knowledge, **Lucent General Knowledge** and **Arihant General Knowledge** books offer comprehensive revisions. **Staying updated on current events through YouTube channels like Study IQ** or apps like **Gradeup, AffairsCloud** is also important.
### English Language Preparation  
The three books to focus repeateadly solveing are - **A Mirror of Common Errors, Kiran Previous Year papers** and **Objective English by SP Bakshi**. This will help strengthen grammar, vocabulary and comprehension abilities.
### Reasoning Ability Practice
Solving past year reasoning question papers from various SSC recruitment exams like **CGL, CHSL, MTS, JE and CPO** provides relevant practice. **Mock tests from portals like SSC Adda and Gradeup** also aid in experience and improving speed. 
## Importance of Mock Tests
While books and materials are the foundation, **regular mock tests are indispensable** for polishing preparation and acclimatizing to the actual exam environment. Mocks should be taking throughout the preparation phase and even **after the completion of subject revision** for accurate self-evaluation. Analyzing performance helps identify weak areas to focus on. With the right approach and **consistent practice of 2-3 mocks per week**, candidates can optimise scores on exam day.
In conclusion, understanding SSC CGL Tier 1 exam pattern in depth, judiciously selecting preparatory books and online resources, and diligent practice through mock tests lay the groundwork for candidates to make the most of their preparation time and potential.
