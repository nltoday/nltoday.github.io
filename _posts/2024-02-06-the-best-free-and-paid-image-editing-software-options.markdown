### Free and Paid Options for Beginners 
For beginners and casual users who are just starting out with basic photo editing, there are several great **free image editing software** options available.

GIMP is fully-featured and very capable, with tools for cropping, color adjustments, applying filters and effects, and more advanced editing like layers and masks. While the interface may not be as intuitive as paid options, GIMP can perform 90% of the tasks that Photoshop can do without any cost. It has a steep learning curve but plenty of online tutorials are available to help new users learn. 
Another good free option is Paint.net. While not as powerful as GIMP, it offers a more beginner-friendly interface and supports basic photo adjustments, selections, layers, effects and tools. For mobile editing on the go, apps like Snapseed, Lightroom Mobile and Facetune are excellent choices for touchscreen editing of photos taken on smartphones. All three apps are free to download and allow you to fix exposure, apply filters, whiten teeth, slim faces and more from your phone or tablet.
### Mid-Range Paid Options for Hobbyists
Hobbyist photographers and more experienced users may prefer investing in a low-cost **paid image editing software** for additional features. Corel PaintShop Pro is a great mid-range option that offers professional-level tools for layers, masks, selection, adjustments and plug-ins for around $80. It includes features found in Photoshop but presented in a more approachable way.
