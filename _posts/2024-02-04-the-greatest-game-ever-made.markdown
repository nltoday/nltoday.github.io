[Building Creativity That Lasts a Lifetime](https://yt.io.vn/collection/ahmadi)
### My Early Days as a Minecraft Veteran
I considered myself, just as PewDiePie, a Minecraft veteran. I have been playing since 2011, the first time I picked up the game at a friend's house. In 2013 I bought the game for my new Xbox 360. I'd have friends come over and played litteral thousands of hours since then. In 2014, I believe, I bought the PC version, for my shitty laptop.

### The Glory Days of Early Minecraft 
Then, around 2015, I got a reasonably good laptop; not a great setup, but less shitty at least. I played MC for a while and stopped when the game started to die out. I rarely played, and when I did, it was purely ironical, just for the joke, usually with some friends. In those days, I started factions on servers and became a raid giant, staying long enough to see rival factions rise and fall. 
### The Rise of Minecraft's Popularity
In 2018, the game started gaining popularity again: the annoying cringey kids moved onto Fortnite and the Minecraft community rose up again. That was the time I got back to it, reconnecting with old friends on servers and starting new adventures. 
### PewDiePie Reignites My Passion 
This month, PewDiePie, the gaming lord and greatest YouTuber, started Gaming WeekÂ© and played Minecraft, initially as a joke. It became a series, he legitimately got hooked on the game, and all his fans love it also. Seeing his enthusiasm drew me back in as well.
### Creating New Worlds with Friends, Old and New
A friend of mine, that hadn't bought the game yet, just bought it after seeing PewDiePie's series. I created a server for us to play on and have been playing for a while now, rediscovering what makes Minecraft so **endlessly creative** and **community building.**
### The Joy of Childlike Creativity 
Though I may be 17, Minecraft allows me to access the childlike sense of wonder and creativity I had as a younger kid. While vanilla Minecraft has its limitations, modded gameplay truly sets the imagination free. Games that follow set patterns simply can't match Minecraft's endless **possibilities for player-driven storytelling** and world-building.
### An Oasis of Freedom in a Scheduled World
After years playing within Minecraft's gentle guidance but open-ended boundaries, structured games with set levels feel constrictive. In Minecraft, my island kingdom and its primitive technologies stand as a testament to what can emerge from simply placing one block in front of another. Minecraft fosters the kind of **lifelong learning** and **problem-solving** skills we'll need to build our own path in an uncertain world.
### A Place to Call Home
From the early days on Xbox to recent adventures with old friends, Minecraft has been a constant place to return to, a world that's always changing but also comfortingly familiar. More than a game, it's been a creative outlet, a social world, and at times even an escape. After a decade, it continues **sparking imagination** and bringing me joy in a way no other game can. For that, it will always be **the greatest game ever made** to me.
