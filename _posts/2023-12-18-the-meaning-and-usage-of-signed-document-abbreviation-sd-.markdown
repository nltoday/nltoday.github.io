### What is an Sd/-?
In official correspondence, the abbreviated form Sd/- is commonly used to indicate that a document has been signed. This abbreviation is seen in many government and business offices across India. Sd/- stands for "signed already" and signifies that the concerned person has applied their physical signature to the original letter or document.

### A Solution for the Past
In the past, before the widespread use of technology, sending copies of signed documents was challenging. The carbon copy method was used, but this only captured the text and not the actual signature. To represent where the signature should be on copies, Sd/- was written. This helped identify for recipients that the original had been signed by the authorized person.

The person signing takes responsibility for the accuracy of the information to the best of their knowledge.

When an official document bears the mark of Sd/-, it signifies that the contents have been authorized. The concerned individual whose signature is associated with Sd/- confirms and stands by and the details in the document. Other officials and recipients can rely on the information knowing it has received proper approval from the empowered signatory.

For any agreements, orders or correspondence of an official nature, including Sd/- implies that all formalities and procedures have been followed. This lends authenticity and validity to records relying on the signed status it represents.
### Longevity Despite Changes  
Even with digital signing now standard, Sd/- persists due to its well-established meaning in correspondence. The transition to electronic documentation has not diminished the relevance of this abbreviation. Offices maintain its inclusion out of protocol and for the benefit of any residual physical documentation still circulating. Sd/- continues ushering efficiency as a short, recognized signed indicator acceptable across all formats old and new.
### In Summary
In the government and business spheres of India and other South Asian nations, Sd/- remains a fixture of the paperwork landscape. Representing an original signature long before technology, its role has evolved to signify authorized approval in both print and digital contexts. Though concise, Sd/- packs informational value in substantiating that due process was followed for any signed record it accompanies.
