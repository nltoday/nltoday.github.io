## The Beginning of the Journey
After 3 years of dedicated preparation and sacrificing everything, Vani was all set to take her first attempt at JEE Main. She had been studying day and night for months, religiously following her coaching materials and solving advanced questions from PYQs. In mocks, she was consistently scoring over 150 marks which gave her confidence. However, when the D-Day came, things did not go as expected. Despite her best efforts, she could only manage to score two-digit marks and failed to secure even a top 100,000 rank. 
### Facing Disappointment and Self-Doubt
The dismal performance left Vani feeling hopeless and disappointed in herself. All the hard work and sacrifices made over the past 3 years seemed meaningless. She was flooded with questions about what went wrong and started doubting her abilities. All she heard from people around her was criticism about wasting time and not meeting expectations. It was difficult to not let the failure affect her self-esteem and motivation.

## Analyzing What Went Wrong
In the initial days after the results, Vani was too ashamed to even talk about her performance with family members. However, with her mother's encouragement, she began introspecting to understand what led to this outcome. She realized her biggest mistakes were [not attempting mock tests regularly](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-matching-outfits-for-holiday-poodle-dog-christmas-tree-2) and **not completing the syllabus thoroughly** before the exam. This highlighted the gaps in her preparation approach that needed addressing going forward.
### The Value of Structured Guidance 
During her discussion with her mother about analyzing mistakes, Vani came to know about the online learning platform eSaral. Though she had no initial plans to join any more coaching, her mother suggested giving it a try. Vani decided to sign up, realizing she lacked proper mentoring support from her offline classes. The structured guidance and mentors at eSaral proved extremely valuable in improving her approach and boosting confidence over time.
## Gearing Up for Second Attempt
Under the guidance of her mentors at eSaral, Vani worked on strengthening her preparation strategy for her next attempt. She focused on diligently completing full syllabus revisions and attempting regular subject-wise and full mocks tests. This helped identify weak areas to focus on and build mental resilience against test anxiety. 
### Improving Subject-Wise Performance
In her first mock under the new strategy before mains, Vani scored a total of 101 marks with a percentile of 91. Rather than feeling discouraged, she took it as an indicator of gaps to address. She made improving her **Chemistry performance** a priority given her relatively weaker score in the subject previously.
## Excelling in the Second Attempt  
On the exam day, Vani entered with a calm and focused mindset, determined to attempt each question accurately despite time constraints. After completing the paper confidently, she aimed for a 97-98 percentile score while waiting for results. When the final scores were out, she was thrilled to achieve a percentile of 97.48, crossing her own expectations.
### Subject-Wise Growth is Evident
A look at her subject-wise marks displayed significant growth compared to her first attempt. Her Physics score rose from 50 to 62 marks while Chemistry saw a jump from 37 to 65. Even Mathematics showed improvement increasing from 19 to 30 marks. This validated how her targeted preparation under expert guidance paid off.
## Advanced Preparation Begins
While happy with her performance in mains second attempt, Vani understood clearing Advanced was a bigger challenge ahead. Any assumptions about target ranks or scores could not be taken for granted given rising competition levels. She acknowledged results are not always proportional to hard work put in and one cannot expect fruits at every stage. With resolve and lessons learned so far, Vani was now stronger and more **determined than ever to give her best for JEE Advanced preparation.** Her journey was only beginning.

Three years ago, with single-minded focus and dedication, Vani had embarked on the arduous JEE preparation journey. Despite facing initial setbacks and self-doubt after her first mains attempt, she proved her resilience by analyzing mistakes, strengthening strategy and excelling the second time.
### Facing Failures with Courage 
Now looking back, Vani realized no success comes easily without overcoming failures. Her initial disappointing score, though shattering at the time, taught her invaluable lessons on how to identify gaps and improve robustness of her preparation approach. She learned the importance of structured learning, guiding mentorship and regular practice under testing conditions to build mental readiness.
## Gaining a Maturing Perspective
While Advanced still remains an uphill task, Vani has grown wiser accepting results may vary despite best efforts put in. She understands one must not derive self-worth solely from exam outcomes or others' opinions and praise. With her mentor's inspirational guidance, Vani's outlook is now more balanced, optimistic and focused on maximizing her potential through diligent preparations.
