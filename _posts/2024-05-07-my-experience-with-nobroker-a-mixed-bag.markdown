### First Impressions
I had signed up for NoBroker's relaxing rental plan as I urgently needed to rent a property within a week. The relationship manager [Abhishek](https://store.fi.io.vn/cute-axolotl-funny-i-axolotl-questions-salamander-265/men&) promised to help me find listings. In the beginning, there was good communication with **daily assurances** that property links would be shared. However, over time the number of suitable listings remained low considering the area's high demand. Many listings also lacked images and **Abhishek proposed** viewing such incomplete listings, which I refused.

### Lack of suitable options  
As days passed with no promising leads, my hopes faded. I started browsing other sources and found several **well-maintained rental properties** that were never offered, making me question NoBroker's search process. The monopoly of local brokers also restricted NoBroker's access. While **Abhishek continued following up diligently**, the limited choices made the paid plan seem redundant. After losing interest, I stopped responding to **daily assurance calls**.
### Packers and movers nightmare
I also signed up for NoBroker's packers and movers service to shift houses. However, the move turned into a difficult experience. The truck arrived **4 hours late** in the afternoon instead of the scheduled morning time with **no communication** about the delay. To make matters worse, the quote provided **understated the shipment size** resulting in disputes during loading. The movers also brought **improperly sized cartons** like shoe boxes unsuitable for packing. 
### Substandard moving staff  
The **two skinny movers struggled** with the freight. They later refused to load certain items claiming it exceeded the quoted weight. Despite offering a tip out of goodwill, they **demandingly asked for more money** . The goods were haphazardly thrown inside recklessly with **many items kept upside down**, clearly showing careless handling. The poor **coordination and execution** ruined what was supposed to be a simple relocation.
### Learn from mistakes
While NoBroker reviews seemed positive initially, my experience highlighted key shortcomings. Local brokers still control the market restricting choice. Relying solely on reviews without alternate checks can misguide customers. In hindsight, dealing directly with **reputed local packers** through personal meetings for accurate **quoting and capacity assessment** would have ensured a smooth move. This unfortunate lesson taught me the importance of **cross-verifying claims** and not solely depending on any single source.
### A mixed final view  
Overall, NoBroker provided a **convenient rental search platform** through dedicated support. However, the lack of suitable options, discrepancies in the packers service and unrealistic reviews leave room for improvement. For future users, I recommend **thoroughly assessing options**, avoiding incomplete listings and **personally evaluating** shortlisted service partners instead of fully relying on reviews or the platform. While the intent is positive, the experience highlights the reality of prevailing **brokers monopoly** still restricting true disruption. A balanced outlook considers both achievements and shortcomings.
