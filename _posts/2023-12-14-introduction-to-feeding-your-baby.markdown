Baby feeding is one of the most important milestones as your little one grows. This content introduces various feeding options for your baby from 6 months up to one year and provides guidance on choosing the right feeding method.
### Starting Solids 
While breastmilk or formula should remain the main source of nutrition for babies under 6 months, introducing solid foods around 6 months is recommended. Starting solids allows babies to get used to different **tastes, textures and flavors**. Pureed fruits and vegetables make excellent first foods. Homemade baby food ensures you know exactly what your baby eats.

### Introducing a Feeding Cup
Once solids are established, around 6 months, you can introduce a [sippy cup or straw cup](https://store.fi.io.vn/funny-video-gamer-xmas-i-paused-my-game-to-be-here-christmas-24/women&). Look for ones with soft spouts or nipples designed for developing mouths. Exposing babies to cups early aids the transition from bottle to open cup drinking. Continuous use results in easy cup training within a few weeks. 
### Choosing the Right Cup Type  
At around 12 months, when babies can sit unsupported, sippy cups with **spouts or straws** are best. Types with spouts help prevent spills while straw cups prepare for open cup drinking. The **Me n Moms 2 in 1 cup** has a removable spout and straw, making it great for changing skills. Its design keeps baby's mouth in mind for comfort.
### Moving on from Bottles
By 12-15 months, babies can get most of their nutrition from **finger foods and meals.** At this stage, parents typically reduce bottle usage. Switching to an **open cup encourages independence** and hand-eye coordination. It's fine if drinking from a cup takes time as skills develop gradually. Offer water with meals from a cup.
### Supporting Independent Drinking
Between 15-18 months, focus on gradually **weaning off bottles** if not already done. At this stage, babies can drink well from an open cup but may still prefer a trainer cup. Offering drinks at meals encourages sipping. Be patient - independent cup drinking takes practice. Praise all attempts to help build confidence.
### Frequently Asked Questions
Some parents wonder when is it okay to introduce a sippy cup. The general guidance is **around 6 months** if only for water but most introduce them at **12 months** when solids are established. Also, sippy cups are not suitable for non-sitting infants under 12 months. **Bottles with appropriate sized nipples** are best for their developing mouths and motor skills. Be led by baby's feeding cues and abilities.
