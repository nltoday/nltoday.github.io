A look into how Steam functions as a platform and how it benefits from game sales on third-party storefronts.
### Valve's Role as Steam Operator
Valve owns and operates the popular [digital game distribution platform Steam](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-dad-daddy-owner-of-a-chihuahua-chihuahua-lover3736-t-shirt). Through Steam, Valve handles all aspects of running the platform including hosting game files, providing the client, managing user accounts, facilitating in-game purchases, and more. At its core, Steam aims to provide an all-in-one solution for **discovering, purchasing, and playing PC games**.

### Valve's Revenue Model on Steam 
As the operator of Steam, Valve takes a standard **30% cut of all game and in-game item sales** made through the platform. This includes full games, downloadable content (DLC), cosmetic items, loot boxes, and anything else players can purchase through a game's in-built store. The remaining 70% goes to the game developer or publisher. This revenue split has become an industry standard that others like the Epic Games Store and console marketplaces also follow.
### Steam's Distribution of Third-Party Retail Keys
In addition to direct game sales on Steam itself, Valve also offers developers the ability to generate and distribute **large batches of promotional and retail game keys**. These keys can then be sold by third-party stores and bundles without Valve taking a cut. However, Valve still benefits indirectly in a few key ways.
### How Third-Party Sales Drive Traffic to Steam
One way Valve benefits is through increased traffic and wishlists on Steam. Sales and bundles on third-party stores help expose new games to wider audiences and build hype. This drives **wishlists, traffic, and follow-ups on Steam itself** as players look to purchase upcoming content or join friends who purchased there. Deep discounts on bundles also make games more accessible, growing overall playerbases and interest in franchises over time.
### DLC and Additional Purchases on Steam 
Once players own a base game, **Steam is where they naturally look to purchase additional DLC or upgrades**. Even if the game was initially accessed through a third-party key, players will often make follow-up purchases directly through Steam for convenience. This allows Valve to still earn its 30% cut on these supplemental transactions years after the original sale.
### Utilizing Steam Features Boosts Engagement and Discovery
Another benefit for Valve is that owning a game on Steam, even indirectly, still drives players to utilize and engage with Steam's features. Players can see what their friends are playing, browse new recommendations, join groups, and more. This increased usage ultimately leads to **higher discoverability and wishlisting of other games on the platform as well**.
### Steam DRM Bolsters the Platform's Value Proposition 
While it doesn't earn a direct cut, Valve's implementation of DRM through Steam still provides value. Requiring the Steam client and login for activation and multiplayer provides a consistent user experience. It also means the developer relies on Steam's infrastructure, stability, and player base - strengthening the platform overall. This reliance benefits Valve through increased **stickiness of games, players, and developers to its platform long-term**.
### The Flywheel Effect of an Expanding Steam Ecosystem
The synergistic effects of the various ways third-party retailers still drive benefits back to Valve and Steam form what could be called a virtuous flywheel effect. More exposure and sales on external stores grow Steam's wishlists, traffic, and DLC potential. This leads to higher engagement and utilization of Steam features, fueling further discovery and purchases down the line. As the Steam universe expands overall, so too does Valve's opportunities to both directly and indirectly profit from PC gaming wherever it's distributed and played.
### Conclusion
While Valve doesn't directly profit from third-party game key sales, the platform has built-in mechanisms that allow it to still benefit greatly in both obvious and subtle ways. Factoring in Steam's networking effects, DRM involvement, and ability to capture follow-up transactions, it becomes clear why Valve is happy to facilitate wide retail distribution of PC games. In the end, a bigger, more vibrant Steam ecosystem is positive for both the platform and its operator.
