## Ensuring the Correct Language Settings
One common cause of the "Oops, something happened" message is having non-English language settings selected in your browser. To check and correct your language settings, follow these steps:
Open your browser and click on the [Settings](https://store.fi.io.vn/work-hard-shih-tzu-better-life-funny-dog-lover-owner-gift-3) menu. Select the **Language** or **Languages** option to view your currently selected preferences. **If anything other than English is set as the default or top preference, you'll need to modify the settings.** 
Click the **Add** button to include **English (United States)** as an available option. Then drag it to the top of the list so it becomes the default language used on web pages. Be sure to select **English** as the sole language - do not leave other languages enabled as secondary options. 
Once English is set as the primary and only selected language, close the language settings menu and browse to the career site again. The page content should now load properly without errors. Correcting the browser's language to match the website can resolve issues caused by mismatches.
### Checking for Special Characters 
Another potential cause of errors is including special characters like curly quotes, bullets, or uncommon formatting in resume filenames or application fields. Sites may not properly parse text with non-standard characters. 
To check for these, open any **CVs** or **resumes** you plan to attach and manually review the filenames - there should be no unusual symbols. Also take a look at the actual content and remove any special formatting, bullets, or quotes that differ from basic ASCII text. 
Stick to standard upper and lowercase letters, numbers, periods, hyphens, underscores, and spaces when naming files or entering information. Avoid special characters **like ÀÁÂÃÄÅÆÇÈÉÊËÌÍÎÏ and ÑÒÓÔÕÖ×ØÙÚÛÜÝÞß.** Strip these out to resolve errors.

### Formatting Phone Numbers Correctly
Another formatting issue involves phone numbers. Some sites cannot properly parse numbers formatted with periods separating the area code and main number. 
Instead of "123.456.7890", enter phone contacts as "123 456 7890" using only spaces. Also confirm the country code is included if submitting internationally. Formatting numbers with standard spaces instead of periods helps ensure smooth processing.
### Uploading Resumes as Word Files 
Many career sites now only accept resumes/CVs in Microsoft Word (.docx) format due to increased accessibility and sanitization. PDFs are no longer supported by some tools due to difficulties extracting content.
If encountering errors while uploading a PDF resume, try saving the file as a .docx format instead. Open the PDF in Word, enable the protections/privileges (if needed), then save and re-upload as a Word file. This format change may resolve issues caused by unsupported file types.
## Contacting Support for Additional Assistance
If the above suggestions do not fix the "Oops, something happened" error, the next step would be to directly contact the job site's support team for personalized troubleshooting. 
Most career portals provide contact information clearly displayed either at the bottom of pages or within a "Help" or "Support" section. Utilize the provided phone number, email form, or live chat options to describe the issue in detail.
When speaking with an agent, be ready to share specifics like the exact error message, browser/device used, any files attached, and steps taken so far. A support representative may request additional diagnostic information or have you try temporarily disabling browser plugins/extensions as well. 
With their help, the root cause can often be identified and a solution implemented. As a last resort, attempting the application using a different browser in private/incognito mode can sometimes resolve rare site compatibility errors. Pursuing live assistance should uncover a fix.
The "Oops, something happened" message is frustrating but usually indicates an easily correctable technical problem rather than a complete application failure. By methodically checking language settings, file formats, character encodings and more, the issue can be pinpointed and solved. Don't hesitate to reach out to support for additional guidance if the simple steps above do not work. With patience and troubleshooting, the error can be overcome.
I hope this breakdown of potential causes and resolutions has been helpful! Let me know if any part of the problem persists after implementing the recommendations. I'm happy to provide more details or suggestions to ensure a smooth online job application experience.
