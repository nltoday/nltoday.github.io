### Early Settlers with Dark Skin and Pale Eyes
The earliest inhabitants of Britain after the last Ice Age had **dark skin and pale eyes similar to people from the Pathan ethnic group in Pakistan and Afghanistan.** Archaeological evidence suggests they arrived around 10,000 years ago when Britain's connection to mainland Europe allowed them to migrate across land bridges. With dark adaptations, they were well suited for Britain's sunny climate at the time and relied on hunting and gathering for survival.

### Arrival of Farmers with White Skin 
Around 6,000 years ago, the first farmers with lighter skin arrived from mainland Europe, likely from Iberia and other southern regions. They introduced agriculture, domesticated plants and animals, and settled in permanent villages. Over generations, their populations increased and they dispersed across Britain. By the Bronze Age 1800 BC, archaeological findings show these white-skinned farmers were the dominant population in many areas of Britain. 
### Immigration from Far Lands for Trade
Even in ancient times, **Britain attracted immigrants from distant lands due to its natural resources and trade networks.** Tin mining in Cornwall flourished as early as the Bronze Age, with tin being a highly valued metal for making bronze tools and weapons. Archaeological evidence reveals some miners and traders who came to Britain from regions like North Africa ended up settling permanently. This marked the beginning of diverse **immigrant populations in Britain from around the world for economic opportunities.**
### Dynamic Interactions of Groups over Millennia  
As Britain's climate became cooler and wetter 4000 years ago, inhabitants adapted to the changing environment through cultural innovations and interactions between groups. Lighter-skinned populations likely mingled and exchanged ideals with dark-skinned newcomers. This dynamic process over millennia created a tapestry of traditions, languages, and physical traits passed down through generations. By the Iron Age 800 BC, Celtic groups emerged with influence from migrants, reflecting Britain's long history of cultural exchanges between diverse peoples.
### Impact of the Anglo-Saxons and Vikings
From the 5th century AD, Anglo-Saxon tribes from Northern Germany and Denmark migrated to settle eastern and southern Britain, bringing with them Old English language and culture. Over centuries, they became the dominant ethnicity in England though absorbed remnants of indigenous British culture. Later Viking invasions from Norway, Sweden and Denmark especially impacted northern areas like Yorkshire and eastern coasts. Place name evidence reveals their Norse language became embedded locally.
### Modern Britain's Global Networks 
In Tudor times, British exploration and colonization meant more **contacts with indigenous populations in North America, the Caribbean, Africa, India and the Far East.** In subsequent centuries of the British Empire, immigration increased the diversity of Britain's ethnicities. After World War 2, immigrants came from once colonized lands to help rebuild the mother country, forever changing the face of Britain. Today, Britain remains deeply interwoven with the wider world through **global trade, cultural exchange, and movement of peoples.**
