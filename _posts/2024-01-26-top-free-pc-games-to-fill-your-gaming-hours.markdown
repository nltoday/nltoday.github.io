### Get Started with Basic Shooters
Team Fortress 2, Blacklight Retribution, and Warframe are great options for players new to first-person shooters. **Team-based objective multiplayer shooters**, these games feature relatively simple mechanics so players can learn the basics of aiming and controlling their character without too steep of a learning curve. Large player bases also means quick matchmaking times. While the visuals in TF2 and Blacklight may not impress today, their fun gameplay still entertains. Warframe offers a **free-to-play cooperative third-person shooter** experience with more modern visuals.

### Enjoy More Complex Shooters and Battle Arenas 
For those looking for something with more depth, consider Dota 2, Heroes of the Storm, or Smite. As **hybrid MOBA/third-person shooter games**, they incorporate shooter mechanics within a multiplayer online battle arena framework. Last hitting creeps, leveling up abilities, and battling enemy heroes makes for very exciting and strategic team gameplay. League of Legends is also worth trying for its huge player base and production values, though it primarily focuses on the MOBA elements over shooting. Black Squad, PlanetSide 2, and Fortnite deliver more traditional but well-developed shooting across various modes and maps.

Unturned offers open-world [cooperative zombie survival gameplay](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/bulldog). No More Room in Hell puts a horror spin on survival co-op shooter mechanics. For just relaxing multiplayer fun, consider Boring Man or The Expendabros which don't take themselves too seriously. Mods can breathe new life into older games as well - go check out some of the top modifications for games like Starcraft 2 or Warcraft 3 to discover new ways to play.

Itch for some strategy without twitch reflexes? Dota 2, League of Legends, and Heroes of the Storm have **team-oriented strategy** behind their shooter components to satisfy strategy fans. Starcraft 2 and Warcraft 3 also remain excellent real-time strategy classics. Hearthstone, Gwent, and digital card games deliver quick play sessions with **tactical deck-building**. For mass scale combined arms conflicts, check out War Thunder or World of Tanks/Warships for vehicle combat.
