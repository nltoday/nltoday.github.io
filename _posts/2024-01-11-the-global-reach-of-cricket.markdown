### Cricket: More Than a Sport in the Indian Subcontinent
In countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka, cricket is so popular that it has become a major source of entertainment and revenue generation. [Cricket crazy fans](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/abbe) watch matches religiously and packed stadiums are common during international and domestic tournaments. Young children dream of becoming the next cricket superstar. It is essentially treated as a national religion with other sports getting little attention in comparison.

### Cricket's Popularity Varies in Anglophone Nations 
While cricket is also popular to some extent in traditionally Anglophone cricket-playing countries like Australia, England, South Africa, it doesn't have the same level of frenzy. These countries have other major sports that are more mainstream like **rugby football** in countries like England, Australia and South Africa. Cricket is generally relegated to being played and followed mainly during summers when other major sports leagues and tournaments are inactive.
### Cricket Remains Niche Outside Core Regions
In the vast majority of countries outside the Indian subcontinent and traditional Anglophone nations, cricket is virtually unknown to the general public. Unlike football which has truly become a global sport with massive reach, cricket readership remains restricted to just over 10 countries that compete regularly. Most people in places like Europe, Americas and Asia have likely never watched or played the game. 
### The Netherlands: An Exception Among Non-Core Nations
Interestingly, one of the only non-Anglophone/Asian countries where cricket has managed to gain a minor following is the Netherlands. While the **Dutch cricket team** has experienced some success, participating regularly in global tournaments, the sport is still not widely followed within the country. Football continues to be the overwhelming #1 choice for Dutch fans and athletes. Many players on the Dutch cricket team also have family origins in traditional cricket powerhouses.
### Surveying Cricket's Popularity Across Nations
Looking at trends data and social media metrics provides more insights into cricket's inconsistent global fanbase. Google trends and Facebook data clearly shows cricket's dominance as the top sport in countries like India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. However, even in nations like Australia, England and South Africa, it does not have the same status as **soccer** or rugby. Countries like Zimbabwe and the Caribbean nations are more evenly split in their sporting preferences.
### Cricket: A Work in Progress Beyond Its Roots 
In summary, while cricket reigns supreme in the Indian subcontinent where it was born, its popularity drops off considerably outside this base. Traditional Anglo nations follow the sport during their summers but have other preferences most of the year. And for the vast remainder of the world, cricket is an alien concept. Attempts to globalize the game through domestic leagues and governance changes remain a work in progress. For cricket to truly join the ranks of hemispheric sports, greater breakthroughs will be needed beyond its spiritual homeland.
