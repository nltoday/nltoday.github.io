### Understanding What Triggered It
The journey towards overcoming depression first requires understanding what may have initially triggered it. In my case, there were a few key factors that when combined, likely contributed to the onset of depressive symptoms. Firstly, during my first semester of college, I was attempting to juggle both classwork and preparing for important summer placements. However, I wrongly believed that it was normal to **live off only 3-4 hours of sleep each night** like some of my peers claimed. Maintaining such an unsustainable schedule over two months likely took a significant toll on my mental wellbeing. 
Additionally, while I was able to secure a desirable summer placement, by that time I knew deep down that [I was not feeling well both mentally and emotionally](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-chihuahua-rainbow-unicorn-lgbtq-ally-dog-lover-mom-dad-v-neck-t-shirt/men&). I desperately wanted to open up about how I was truly feeling to friends and family but found it incredibly difficult to properly communicate and explain my state. It led to feelings of suffocation and isolation, even when surrounded by loved ones. Within a few short months, I had lost all motivation and will to attend classes or get through my day. The depression had taken a firm hold over my life.

### Seeking a Medical Diagnosis 
It became abundantly clear that professional help was needed to properly diagnose what I was experiencing. A major sign that something was deeply wrong occurred during a mock interview organized by my college. Despite always being an extremely confident public speaker, I utterly froze and was unable to say a single word. My worried professor, who also happened to be a trained psychologist, recognized the alarming symptoms. After speaking to me further and consulting with my mother, she strongly felt it was a case of clinical depression. 
Getting that initial medical diagnosis was the first crucial step in my journey of overcoming this illness. It validated the immense struggle I was going through and ruled out the possibility that it was just a temporary phase or due to mood swings. The doctor reinforced that this was indeed a serious mental health condition requiring immediate treatment and support.
### Embarking on the Recovery Process
With acceptance of my depression diagnosis came the difficult but necessary work of treatment and recovery. A multi-pronged approach was undertaken on recommendation from my doctor. Firstly, I started taking prescribed sedatives to help regulate my disturbed sleep schedule and allow my body to rest. Secondly, my family especially my mother became my strongest pillar of support. She ensured I was never alone and accompanied me to daily activities like exercise and walking. Yoga and meditation techniques like **bhramari** and **kapal bharti pranayama** also proved very effective in managing stress and anxiety. 
Within three short months following this regimen diligently, I was able to return to attending college classes regularly again. It was a challenging yet deeply meaningful journey that reinforced how vital acceptance, medical intervention, family support, and lifestyle changes can be in overcoming even the most debilitating of mental health conditions like depression.
### Reprogramming Unhelpful Thought Patterns
While medications and lifestyle adjustments were critical for the acute phase of treatment, ongoing mental work was still required to prevent relapse and achieve long-lasting recovery. A major component involved recognizing and changing the thought patterns that were fueling depressive symptoms. Buddhism teachings on this subject really helped provide an alternative framework for managing my mind. 
One key learning was understanding that I am not defined or limited by my thoughts - I have the power to objectively observe the mental process and influence it. This helped reduce the intensity with which I was internalizing every negative thought. I also came to see that thoughts come and go constantly, and dwelling on any particular thought for too long gives it disproportionate meaning and credibility. With dedicated practice of mindfulness and catching each unhelpful thought as it arose, I was able to counter it with more constructive perspectives. 
Creating lists of past positives as well as present joys also balanced out the obsessive recall of past difficulties. Simply shifting mental focus outward through acts of kindness for others served to lessen self-absorption. Gradually, these practices rewired my default thinking patterns away from the depressive rut. It was a revelation to realize I did not have to remain a prisoner of my own mind.
### Harnessing the Healing Power of Nature
Spending time in nature played a tremendously restorative role during my recovery journey. When overwhelmed by symptoms, getting outside even for short walks proved grounding. Over longer periods, solo trips to scenic spots like hill stations allowed for valuable self-reflection. There is something profoundly healing about the beauty and vastness of natural environments that can help put personal troubles into better perspective.
Being surrounded by trees, mountains, oceans or simply green open spaces has proven psychological benefits ranging from reduced stress and anger to lifted mood. Studies also point to how nature exposure impacts brain functioning linked to depression, such as cortical and limbic areas. For someone experiencing a period of low mood, simply gazing at scenes of nature through photos has been shown to aid recovery nearly as much as being there in person does. 
When dark thoughts would inevitably creep back in, revisiting beautiful sights and sounds from my travels served as a welcome distraction. The memories themselves carried an uplifting effect. I came to truly appreciate nature's magnificence and the solace it could offer even during life's most difficult phases. To this day, making time for the great outdoors remains an integral part of maintaining my mental wellness.
### Leveraging Acts of Kindness 
Finding purpose and meaning beyond oneself also played a major role in overcoming my depression. This was achieved through engaging in small daily acts of kindness and service towards others. When struggling with severe symptoms, it becomes all too easy to retreat inward completely. However, making the effort to shift one's focus outwards onto others proves remarkably therapeutic.
For me, simple gestures like playing with neighborhood kids, feeding street animals or assisting elderly family members provided a renewed sense of usefulness during dark periods. Volunteering time at charities or community centers allowed for social interaction in a low pressure environment. Such altruistic behaviors stimulate the release of feel-good neurotransmitters in the brain while also fostering a more grateful mindset. 
Research overwhelmingly supports that acts of kindness lead to greater happiness, life satisfaction and mental wellbeing across populations. Even helping a single other person has been shown to strongly decrease depressive symptoms in clinical studies. While not feeling up to much during acute episodes, I strived to make basic compassion central to my daily routine. It played a major supportive role in lifting myself up from the depths of depression.
### Journaling for Self-Exploration and Growth
Regular journaling provided another invaluable tool for better understanding my experience with depression as well as tracking progress. When my thoughts were highly distorted, articulating how I was feeling each day onto paper promoted clarity. It separated experiences from interpretations, allowing objective reflection. Over time, revisiting past entries showed the transformative stages of recovering mental health and confidence. 
Documenting victories big or small in successfully dealing with dark moments motivated for continued growth. Exploring deeper psychological and emotional patterns through writing strengthened self-awareness greatly. Raising awareness around mental health issues, I found sharing anonymized journal excerpts online with those facing similar challenges brought its own healing. The simple act of putting pen to paper regulates stress levels and promotes improved mood and resilience according to scientific literature.
Today journaling remains a treasured daily mindfulness practice. It serves as both a record of progress as well as a compassionate listening ear in difficult moments. Looking back over entries spanning years reinforces how far Iâ€™ve come from the depths of depression through ongoing personal work, community support and integrating multiple evidence-backed strategies for wellness and post-traumatic growth.
In conclusion, overcoming clinical depression required a multi-pronged approach tailored to individualized needs and circumstances. While medication and professional guidance were imperative to recovery, ongoing mental and spiritual work to change thought habits, engage meaningful activities and cultivate compassion played equally vital roles in the journey towards thriving wellness. Natural environments, daily kindness as well as journaling proved strong personal allies. With compassion and determination, even the deepest depressive episodes can be overcome.
