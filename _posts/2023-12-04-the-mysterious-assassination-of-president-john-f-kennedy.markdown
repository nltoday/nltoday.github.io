### The Reason Behind The Assassination
There was a [highly controversial conspiracy](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-girl-who-loves-scotties-scottish-terrier-dog-breed-owner-1) behind President Kennedy's assassination supposedly by a single gunman from the Dallas Texas book depository. The real reason was based on the secret plan by John F. Kennedy and his brother Bobby Kennedy, the Attorney General, to assassinate Fidel Castro in Cuba on December 1st, 1963. The notorious crime families, **Mafia dons** like Carlos Marcello from New Orleans along with Santos Trafficante and Johnny Roselli, were involved in the plot as they had been working with the CIA for years to assassinate Castro but later learned about the Kennedy brothers' own plan to kill Castro, codenamed **AMWORLD**, through their contacts.

### The AMWORLD Coup Plan
The AMWORLD coup plan was to shoot Castro by a sniper while he was travelling in his jeep on his way home, arranged by the commander of Cuban army, Juan Almeida, who was dissatisfied with Castro moving closer to the Soviet orbit. There would then be an **invasion of Cuba** by Latin American exiles which the Kennedy administration would support by warning Soviet Union against intervening. 14 drafts of the plan were drawn up indicating it was not just a contingency. The Secretary of State and Defense were aware of contingency plans but didn't know Juan Almeida was the asset in Cuba filling that role. 
### The Mafia Learns About The Coup
Johnny Roselli had been working with David Morales at the CIA Miami station, supposedly on Castro plots. The CIA made a $50,000 down payment to Almeida's family which was the responsibility of E. Howard Hunt and his assistant Bernard Barker, who also worked for Santos Trafficante, ensuring the Tampa godfather knew everything about the coup planning. With 14 drafts and a definite date of December 1st, it was clearly not a contingency plan as some argue. This certainty was the reason for the 3 attempts on JFK in November 1963 by the Mafia to stop the coup.
### Reasons for Assassinating JFK in Dallas
Dallas was part of Carlos Marcello's territory making it ideal. Secondly, the route was slow-moving with no secret service, unlike other cities, and the limousine speeding up after the shooting ensured evidence was scattered, difficult to investigate properly. 
### Identities of the CIA Operatives Involved
An important meeting took place in Miami in 1963 attended by high-level CIA operatives like Frank Sturgis, David Morales and William Harvey involved in Cuban operations and the anti-Kennedy plot. E. Howard Hunt agreed only to assist in the cover-up. 
### Mysteries Surrounding the Autopsy Explained
The controversial altering of JFK's body and wounds between Dallas and the official autopsy is explained by the performance of a prior secret National Security Autopsy as decreed by Kennedy himself for any official dying under unnatural causes, to check if Castro pre-emptively struck in response to the coup plans being leaked. This solved the mysteries of the illegal removal and different coffin.
### The Immediate Reaction 
YouTube shows newscasters immediately speculated a connection between Oswald and Jack Ruby, who strolled into the heavily guarded police station and shot the accused assassin in front of 70 cops within 48 hours, looked like an obvious conspiracy even before investigating further. To assassinate the assassin so quickly smacks of a conspiracy cover-up of what really happened.
### The Plan Changed to Dallas
The original plan was to be carried out in Miami but changed to Dallas as they had operatives ready anywhere. Dallas provided the worst situation for security as JFK insisted on the open top car through the big city, making assassination much easier to accomplish undetected. The location change may have been by design for better chances of success in ending JFK's life.
### Conclusion
Taking all evidence and interconnecting details into account, there are too many coincidences, connections and changes to simply call it the work of lone assassins. There are very clear motives as well as direct involvement and knowledge of powerful underworld and intelligence figures. The immediate reaction of suspicion by the public also proved to be well-founded. While upsetting, the facts point strongly to an complex conspiracy to assassinate JFK to prevent the Cuba coup and protect other covert operations. Further independent research like the books mentioned provide compelling proof, solving the case and myriad mysteries of that tragic event.
