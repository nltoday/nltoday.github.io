### Microcomputer Software
When Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft in 1975, they needed a company name. Because they built [MICROcomputer SOFTware](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-dog-training-good-boy-k-lovers-gift-t-shirt), the name **Microsoft** was a perfect fit that clearly communicated what the company did. The name was simple yet descriptive and memorable. Starting a new company requires carefully selecting a name that represents the brand image.

### Finding the Right Name 
Creating a brand name is a challenging process that considers many factors. Names should be **non-offensive, trademark-free**, and **align with company values**. Geographical terms seem safe, but can cause backlash if they upset certain groups. Every major brand spends considerable effort vetting potential names. 
Product demos require **placeholder company names** that don’t infringe on real brands. Microsoft chose “Contoso” in the 1990s for such purposes. The name was inoffensive, allowed demonstrating software features without bias, and avoided legal issues. Over time, Contoso became a **de facto trademark** everyone associated with Microsoft demonstrations.
### Choosing “Northwind Traders”
Another placeholder name Microsoft uses is “Northwind Traders.” Like Contoso, it was chosen to be a **harmless placeholder for software demos**. Neither name reflects an actual business, but serve the purpose of allowing demonstrations without bias toward real companies. Placeholder names just need to be recognizable enough that users understand the demo context.
### Benefits of Established Placeholder Names 
Using established placeholders like Contoso and Northwind Traders provides many benefits for Microsoft over time. These names are **globally recognized symbols** for unbiased demonstrations. Anyone in the technology industry understands they represent fictional companies only. Not choosing established placeholders risks confusing users or causing unintentional offense. 
Well-known placeholders save developers time spent explaining dummy data. Users grasp demo purposes immediately. And legal issues are avoided, as placeholder names don't resemble real businesses. For a major technology brand, agreed-upon placeholders allow smooth, unbiased demonstrations focusing on software capabilities rather than hypothetical partner companies.
### Finding the Right Balance
Selecting a company name requires balancing practical considerations. Names should represent the company image while avoiding legal/political issues. Placeholder names for unbiased demos face similar challenges. Microsoft found an effective balance with Contoso and Northwind Traders, which achieved global recognition without offense over decades of use. Major brands continuously refining naming practices ensure suitable representation in an increasingly global business environment.
