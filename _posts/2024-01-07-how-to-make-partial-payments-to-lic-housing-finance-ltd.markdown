### Understanding the Process 
LIC Housing Finance is a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) that provides housing loans in India. Since it is not a bank, you cannot make payments to LIC HFL through NEFT, RTGS or other digital means. The only accepted payment methods are cheques and demand drafts (DD). While they accept prepayments, you may face some issues if you intend to close the loan by making a full balance transfer payment. It is best to contact the local branch for clarity on the process.

### Payment Address Details  
To make a partial payment, you need to obtain a cheque or DD in favor of "LIC Housing Finance Ltd". It is optional but advisable to mention your loan account number in brackets after the payee name. You must write your name, loan account number and contact number on the back of the cheque/DD. Finally, courier or post the payment instrument to the branch office from where you took the loan. For example, payments for loans given in Bangalore should be sent to "LIC Housing Finance Ltd Back Office, Ground Floor, 15/1, Hayes Centre, Hayes Road, Bangalore 560025, Near Bishop Cotton Boys School/Cash Pharmacy, Residency Road".
### Disadvantages of Full Prepayment
Some borrowers intend to repay the full outstanding loan amount in one go to save on interest costs. However, LIC HFL does not allow [complete loan balance prepayments](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/ader). They insist that even if you have funds, the repayment must be done through EMIs to continue earning interest income. This forces customers to involuntarily pay unnecessary interest, affecting their financial planning. While prepayment is accepted, insisting on EMIs only for additional profit is an unfair practice.
### Alternate Partial Payment Methods
Currently there is no online or digital payment option for making easy **partial housing loan repayments**. However, borrowers have found some workarounds. You can deposit cash at certain bank branches and they will issue a pay-in-slip as proof of payment. Some cooperative banks also allow depositing cash and issuing DDs/cheques in favor of LIC HFL. Another option is getting account payee cheques from friends/relatives and couriering it to the branch. While not direct online payments, these indirect methods reduce physical visits for depositing cash.
### Filing Complaints for Refusal of Payments
As per regulations, LIC HFL cannot refuse partial or full prepayments if the borrower wishes to settle the loan before maturity. However, some branches may still deny payments without valid reason. In such cases, you can raise a formal complaint with the National Housing Bank (NHB), which is the housing finance sector regulator. You can also write an email explaining the issue, with your loan and contact details. Mention that you may approach NHB if the matter is not resolved promptly. Generally, the threat of a regulator complaint is enough for most financial institutions to reconsider their stand.
### Importance of Checking Loan Terms and Conditions
Before making any prepayments, it is critical to thoroughly check the loan terms and conditions document issued at the time of sanction. Note down important points like minimum repayment tenure and amounts, applicable prepayment charges if any, process for part or full prepayments etc. Discuss any doubts with branch manager in advance over phone or by visiting. Being well informed will help you assert your rights and avoid unnecessary disputes later. In case of discrepancies between verbal and documented processes, always rely on the written agreement terms.
### Summary
To conclude, while LIC HFL currently lacks direct online payment options, partial prepayments can be made via cheques/DDs sent to local branches. Always cross check terms before such payments to avoid issues. Some workarounds exist if direct payment is not possible. Borrowers should be aware of their rights regarding prepayment as per regulations and file complaints if denied unjustly. Overall, planning repayments in advance and knowing the exact processes makes the transaction hassle-free.
