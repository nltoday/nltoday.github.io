Quora is a knowledge sharing platform that allows people to ask questions and learn from others. While it provides great value to users, as a for-profit startup, Quora also needs to generate revenues to sustain its business. This article discusses how Quora is building a world-class knowledge database and exploring contextual advertising for monetization.
### Focusing on High-Quality User-Generated Content
From the beginning, Quora realized that high-quality user-generated content would be key to its success. It offered a simple but effective Q&A format for real people to share authentic knowledge and experiences.

### Patience from Investors Allowed Steady Growth  
Unlike many startups rushing to profitability, Quora benefited from investor patience. For years, it operated at a loss while refining the product experience. This allowed organic growth rather than forcing early monetization. Users could discover Quora naturally without ads disrupting the flow. Gradually, as the userbase expanded through positive word-of-mouth, Quora became better positioned for monetization later on. The **$160 million funding** showed investors understood its long-term revenue potential once ready.
### Popularity Driven by Top search engine results
Even with a relatively small subscriber base, Quora sees huge traffic since its answers often rank at the top of search results for many common queries. This is due to factors like timely updates, response quality, author credibility, and comprehensive coverage of **related longtail keyword topics**. Currently hosting over 80 million monthly visitors, Quora has become one of the most visited websites worldwide mainly through organic search traffic rather than direct viewership alone.
### Contextual Advertising - The Monetization Approach
To generate revenues, Quora plans to introduce contextual advertising only to non-subscribers. These carefully targeted ads will complement relevant queries and answers without disrupting the user experience. By blending seamlessly within appropriate content topics, such **contextual longtail keyword advertising** has the potential to be highly engaging and profitable for both advertisers and Quora. Subscribers will continue enjoying an ad-free experience upholding the quality of interactions. 
### Advertiser Value through Intent-Driven Targeting
Contextual ads on Quora offer advertisers a unique way to reach customers searching for specific solutions or making purchase decisions. By matching ads with questions and responses covering related **keyword topics associated with buyer intent**, Quora can directly connect businesses to potential buyers actively exploring options. This makes for a more meaningful advertising environment boosting engagement and conversion rates compared to interruptive banner ads elsewhere.
### Improving the Subscriber Experience to Expand Knowledge 
To constantly enrich its knowledge database, Quora focuses on optimizing features that incentivize high-quality contributions from subscribers. Through initiatives like topic suggestions, guided answers, and improved moderation, it aims to make the experience more fun, rewarding and impactful. By constantly engaging top experts and regular users to share their unique perspectives covering new **emerging longtail keyword topics**, Quora is expanding the scope and depth of collective human wisdom available on its platform.
### Multiple Exit Options Once Monetized Successfully
Now valued over $1 billion, Quora has the potential to generate substantial returns for investors if it succeeds in monetization through advertising. Once revenues are consistently flowing in, it will have options like acquisition by a major tech company or going for an initial public offering. Being relatively well-known, Quora also has scope for continuing independently as a profitable business. Overall, by building a one-of-a-kind crowd-sourced knowledge repository supported by contextual monetization, Quora aims for a sustainable long-term future.
