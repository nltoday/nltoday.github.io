### The First Shark - A Small Mako Shark 
My very first shark was a 35-pound mako shark that I caught myself. [It took approximately five minutes](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-custom-proud-football-grandma-number-60-personalized-women-v-neck-t-shirt/women&) but felt like 30 seconds as I fought the fish on my fishing reel. This shark was very small and young, so after a quick picture, we released it back into the water. Catching even a small shark for the first time was really exciting and got me interested in pursuing bigger sharks.

### A Larger Mako That Got Away
The next time I went shark fishing, my friend Billy caught what we estimated to be a 260 pound mako shark. **It took Billy close to an hour** of fighting with this much larger shark before the captain went to gaff it and bring it onboard. Unfortunately, the captain missed with the gaff and **the line broke**, allowing the huge mako to escape at the last moment. I'll never forget seeing the massive shark surface next to the boat before it swam away.
### Fishing for Blue Sharks With Ultra Light Gear 
One trip, I remember fishing for blue sharks using ultra light tackle that was definitely not meant for catching larger fish. The blue shark I hooked took the bait but quickly realized it was more than my light gear could handle. **No matter how hard I fought the fish**, I was simply overmatched and never managed to land it before the line eventually broke. It was an exciting battle but reminded me that using appropriately strong gear is important when fishing for sharks.
### Catching My First Bull Shark At Night  
My first bull shark catch came at night while fishing in Tampa Bay with my father and sister shortly after the movie "Jaws" came out. **It took approximately 45 minutes** of reeling and working the line before the captain was finally able to shine a light on the shark, which we weighed at 140 pounds. After shooting the shark six times with a handgun due to his disdain for sharks after his sister was attacked, we decided to call it a night due to approaching storms.
### Typical Times For Other Sharks Caught And Released
The other sharks I've caught since then ranged from 25 to 200 pounds and generally took **between 15 minutes to an hour** to bring close to the boat depending on their size. **Unlike some fishermen whotarget sharks**, I don't specifically go after them - sometimes they just take the bait I've put in the water. In all cases,I've been careful to release any sharks I catch so they can continue playing their role in the ocean ecosystem.
### Proper Techniques For Landing Large Sharks Safely 
When initially fighting a large shark, **it can take 15 minutes to over two hours** to tire the fish out and bring it close to the boat.At this stage, it's crucial for all on board to know their roles and ensure the gaffing area is clear of any limbs or obstructions.If the shark is gaffed or harpooned, it will regain energy and could become dangerous.The key next step is to quickly loop a rope around the tail to "cut the motor" and remove the threat of the powerful tail.Leaving the shark tied to the boat for an hour allows it to fully calm down before bringing onboard.Following these practices helps land even the biggest sharks safely.
### Final Steps For a Successful Catch and Release  
Some fishing tournaments require sharks be brought onboard the boat before the allotted weigh-in time, which isn't ideal if the shark still has energy left.In these situations, tying a bucket over the shark's head seems to subdue it until it can be released.From the initial strike to release back into the sea, the total time involved in catching a large shark can span up to three hours.Proper handling and safety practices are important to successfully catch sharks for fun while ensuring their well-being and ability to survive catch and release situations.Overall, fishing for sharks provides an exciting challenge compared to other species.
