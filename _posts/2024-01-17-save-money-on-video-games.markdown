### Tracking Discounts and Sales
One of the best ways to save money on video games is to track discounts and sales across different websites. [IsThereAnyDeal website](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-chihuahua-rainbow-unicorn-lgbtq-ally-dog-lover-mom-dad-v-neck-t-shirt/men&) is a useful tool that allows you to add games to your watchlist and be notified about price drops on Steam, GOG, Uplay, Origin and other digital storefronts. This site also provides historical lowest prices to help determine if a current sale price is a good deal. By using a deal tracking service, you can patiently wait for big discounts rather than paying full price.

### Utilizing Wishlists and Newsletters
Nearly all major digital storefronts like **Steam, Epic Games Store** and others have a wishlist feature that will email you when a game on your list goes on sale. This is a passive way to be alerted about price drops for games you want without constantly checking websites. Subscribe to newsletters as well to get notified about upcoming sales and promotions. Many stores also promote countdowns leading up to major seasonal sales to build excitement.
### Timing Purchases Around Holidays
The best times to find huge discounts are during seasonal sales around winter holidays, spring/easter, summer and back to school season in late summer. In particular, the **Steam Summer Sale and Steam Winter Sale** offer up to 90% off thousands of games across multiple genres. It's worth waiting a few extra months if a game isn't a priority to save significantly during one of these annual mega sales events. Halloween and Black Friday sales can yield discounts as well.
### Consider Third-Party Retail Key Sellers 
While it may seem risky, purchasing game keys from third-party websites like **Green Man Gaming, CDKeys, Fanatical** and others is often the most budget-friendly option. These sites regularly offer newly released titles for 20-50% off since they buy keys in bulk to resell. Though they sell Steam keys, the games still activate on your Steam library and work the same as retailer bundles. Just make sure to only shop from trusted retailers with many customer reviews to avoid any activation issues.
### Download Free-To-Play and Trial Games
For gamers on a tight budget, there are many outstanding **free-to-play and trial game options.** Titles like Apex Legends, Fortnite, Dota 2, Path of Exile, World of Tanks and Warframe offer extensive gameplay without any upfront cost. Meanwhile, services like Xbox Game Pass, Steam Free Weekends and Epic Games Store give limited time trials of paid titles. This allows testing games before buying to ensure they are worth the purchase price. Some F2P games like Genshin Impact are entirely doable without in-app purchases as well.
### Research Bundle Deals and Humble Bundle
Game bundles that package multiple titles together in one discounted package are another savvy way to stock up a library on a budget. **Humble Bundle** is well known for their pay-what-you-want bundles that often include AAA games, while Fanatical regularly runs timed deals like the **Taco Bundle** offering 15+ games for just $5. It's worth watching for new batches and browsing bundled games to find hidden gems for cheap. The individual bundle games can also sometimes be unlocked as Steam keys later if you missed a bundle.
### Consider Used Game Markets  
While digital games can't be resold, **used physical console games** allow the community to avoid paying full launch prices. Websites like eBay and local shops like GameStop offer pre-owned game discs and cartridges at prices often 30-60% below retail cost.  Players are also able to trade or sell their own games to recoup some funds once completed to put towards future purchases. Just be sure to thoroughly check condition of any discounted used titles before purchasing.
### Utilize Membership Rewards Programs 
Some membership subscription services provide great value to save in the long-run. **Xbox Game Pass** for console and PC allows access to over 100 games for a low monthly fee that is frequently discounted. A one or three month subscription when on sale can offer access to dozens of $60 games for the price of two. Similarly, services like PlayStation Plus, Amazon Prime Gaming and Twitch Prime bundle free games each month to keep for as long as subscribed.
### Look Out For Price Mistakes and Promo Code Leaks
On rare occasions, major retailers will accidentally list games at prices dramatically below MSRP for a limited window of time before correcting. Eager fans closely monitor deal forums like Slickdeals.net to capitalize on these types of **pricing errors and leaked promo codes** for rock-bottom game deals. Though uncommon, keeping an eye out could land a newly released $60-80 AAA title for just a few dollars during a pricematch window. It pays to lurk deal communities. 
### Cost-Saving Final Thoughts
With some patience and strategy, it's totally possible to maintain a robust gaming library on a budget by prioritizing discounts, sales, bundles, F2P options and membership perks over paying $60 launch prices. Tracking trends using a deal-listing service, establishing wishlists and watching for the biggest annual sale events will yield the biggest long-term savings. Don't forget to also check pre-owned options and embrace free-to-play games as alternatives when funds are limited for new releases.
