### Refreshing Windows Update Components
One way to resolve update errors stemming from service or file issues is to refresh important Windows Update files and components. The DISM and SFC tools allow you to scan, cleanup, and restore the Windows image without reinstalling the entire OS.
To start, open an elevated Command Prompt and enter "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth" to trigger a restore operation. This repairs package and servicing store corruption. Next, run "sfc /scannow" to check for integrity violations and replace damaged system files. 
These simple steps have resolved the 0x80070005 error for many users by refreshing the foundation required for successful updates. Give it a try if other solutions have failed. 
### Increasing Available Storage
Lack of free disk space is a prevalent cause of failed updates. To fix this, remove unnecessary files and programs to **increase available storage on your C: drive**. Also, consider moving content like videos, music and documents to an external drive to free up internal storage.
Aim for at least 20GB of free space as a general guideline. Then run the Windows System Storage Check tool to clean up temporary files, remove unused languages, and optimize drive usage further. Reboot and retry downloading the update once storage thresholds are satisfied.
### Removing Old Drivers
Outdated, unfixable or corrupted drivers can block updates by conflicting with new Windows files. To resolve this as a potential 0x80070005 root cause, use the Device Manager to scan for and uninstall drivers with warnings or errors. 
Pay close attention to drivers for graphics cards, chipsets, network/wifi adapters and peripherals, as these are common culprits. Restart after removing each problematic driver and try updating again. If issues persist, contact the manufacturer for updated driver packages.
### Using the Update Assistant Tool 
For stubborn 0x80070005 errors resistant to standard troubleshooting, Microsoft provides an offline Update Assistant tool that analyzes and repairs your system specifically for update readiness.
Download the tool matching your Windows 10 version, double-click to run and select "Additional troubleshooters" from the main screen. Choose "Update Readiness" and follow prompts to run automated cleanup, repairs and tests. This intensive procedure has helped many installations finally overcome persistent update blockers.
### Performing a Clean Install
If all else fails, your Windows installation may be too damaged or corrupted to properly receive updates through standard means. In this case, the safest option is to perform a clean reinstall of Windows 10 while keeping personal files.
Create installation media using the Media Creation Tool, boot from it, and select "Keep nothing" during setup for a clean wipe and refresh. Once installation completes, Windows should download and seamlessly apply any waiting updates without issues. Just be sure to backup critical data beforehand.
### Preparing for Future Updates
After resolving the 0x80070005 error, take proactive steps to avoid facing it again:
-Configure at least 30GB of reserved storage for system/updates and temporarily uninstall non-essential programs/games as needed before major releases. 
-Check for optional updates regularly through Windows Update to stay protected and current on important patches.
-Only install drivers directly from manufacturer sites to avoid outdated versions causing conflicts down the line. 
-Run periodic maintenance with Disk Cleanup, SFC and DISM to maintain image/file integrity over the long-term.
