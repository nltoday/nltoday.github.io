### The Organ that Named Itself
The human brain is truly a remarkable organ. Not only does it control all functions of the body, process senses, facilitate movement, regulate internal organs and more - but it is also the only organ that is capable of studying itself. Through thousands of years of progress in neuroscience, biology and related fields, our brain has uncovered more and more of its own mysteries. We now understand how brain cells called neurons communicate through electrical and chemical signals. Using techniques like EEG, fMRI and CT scans, scientists can observe the brain in action and map which regions light up for different tasks. Through decades of trial and error during neurosurgery, we've learned where motor skills, speech, memory and other domains reside in the brain. It named itself and continues to uncover its own complex processes.

### The Smallest Units of Time 
Our understanding of physics also progressed tremendously thanks to studying light. The exact speed of light was measured through experiments by famous scientists like Galileo, RÃ¶mer, Fizeau and Michelson. By definition, the speed of light in a vacuum is 299,792,458 m/s. Scientists realized that distances as small as a [centimeter](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/dog-mother) could be expressed in units of time using this constant speed. The **jiffy** was coined as a unit equal to the time taken by light to travel one centimeter, approximately 33.3564 **picoseconds**. The picosecond itself is an incredibly tiny unit of time - one trillionth of a second. At these hyper small scales, scientists can observe fundamental processes in atoms, molecules and the movement of electrons that govern chemical reactions and energy transfers. Examining phenomena at the picosecond and **jiffy** scale has revolutionized fields such as electronics, medicine, materials science and more. 
### The Dust in Our Clothes
Speaking of tiny observations, did you know the substance that collects at the bottom of pants pockets and cuffs has a name? It's called **gnurr**. This may seem like a useless fact but studying even mundane occurrences can teach us something new. For one, the presence of gnurr tells us tiny particles are constantly shed from our bodies and clothes as we move through the day. These particles contain things like skin cells and textile fibers that snag on folds of fabric. While individually microscopic, over time they accumulate into visible clumps. Gnurr gives us a window into the invisible world of microscopic debris shed by our daily activities. It's a reminder that even in casually observing ordinary life, there remain many mysteries left to uncover.
### The Mysteries of Water
One ubiquitous substance that still holds many secrets is water. Composed of two hydrogen atoms bonded to an oxygen, its basic chemical structure is simple. Yet water plays a central role in almost all biological and geological processes on Earth. It is present in all living things as the basis for fluids like blood and is essential for life itself. Over 70% of the Earth and the human body is made up of water. However, there are still properties of water we don't fully understand like how it is able to exist as solid ice, liquid water and gas water vapor in our environment and shift between states with small changes in temperature and pressure. 
Recent advances in ultra-fast laser technology allow scientists to probe the structure and motions of individual water molecules on extremely short timescales from femtoseconds to **picoseconds**. Studies using dielectric spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations reveal water's hydrogen-bond network is in a constant state of rearrangement on these fast timescales. A single hydronium ion (H3O+) exists for only around 1 **picosecond** in water before breaking apart its hydrogen bonds with neighboring water molecules. Such dynamic behavior at the molecular scale impacts macroscopic properties we observe. There remains much to uncover about how water's short-lived structures and rapid molecular motions govern its unique role as the solvent of life.
### Materials at the Nanoscale 
Advances in microscopy and nanoscience now allow visualizing and manipulating matter at the nanoscale of billionths of a meter. The **nanometer** ranges from 1 to 100 nanometers which is smaller than the smallest detectable details of a light microscope yet larger than the dimensions of molecules and atoms. At these hyperfine scales, new quantum mechanical phenomena emerge that do not exist at larger scales. The optical, electrical and magnetic properties of materials can differ dramatically at the nanoscale compared to in bulk form. 
A plethora of nanoscale structures, particles and devices with applications across industries are now possible to engineer by directly assembling or visualizing individual atoms and molecules. For example, nanotubes, quantum dots and materials with programmable properties at the press of a button are attracting interest for applications in electronics, energy storage, medicine and more. By precisely controlling composition and structure from the bottom-up at the nanoscale, researchers are attempting to design new materials with desired functions and properties. The ongoing ability to visualize and control increasingly finer features will undoubtedly lead to new discoveries and applications across science and technology in the coming decades.
### The Final Frontier 
Even at scales of entire galaxies, nebulae and other cosmic structures, mysteries remain to be uncovered throughout the observable universe. After centuries of astronomical observations and breakthroughs like Hubble that allowed peering deeper into the cosmos, modern astrophysicists continue to reveal new insights into the nature of dark matter, dark energy, black holes and the origins of the universe in the seconds after the big bang using tools like the Hubble Space Telescope, Chandra X-ray Observatory and upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.
One area generating excitement is the emerging field of exoplanet research through Kepler and other observatories. They have detected thousands of planets orbiting other stars, many perhaps capable of supporting life. As detection techniques improve, eventually current and future instruments may even enable analyzing atmospheres of Earth-size exoplanets for potential biosignatures that could point to life. The universe remains a vast, infinite frontier with countless revelations still ahead, propelling humanity's eternal quest to understand our place in the cosmos and search for life elsewhere.
