### Engaging Through Quality Content
While tools and paid promotions have their place, high-quality, engaging content remains king for building authentic connections. Focus on consistently delivering value to your audience through different types of posts. Use images, videos, infographics and written blogs tailored to your niche. Ask questions, be helpful, humorous and human. Interact positively with others by commenting, sharing valuable third party content using relevant hashtags.

Do not just post and forget. Being responsive, commenting and interacting shows your audience you care. Stay on top of conversations, answer questions promptly and personally thank people.

Consistency is key - do not miss more than a couple of days or risk losing momentum. Over time, with quality engagement and efforts, your follower base will steadily grow organically through shares and word-of-mouth.
### Measuring Success Holistically  
While the number of followers is important, focus more on engagement metrics like comments, shares and reactions per post. Set measurable goals beyond just counts to gain true insights. Track conversion rates if driving sales. Monitor site traffic and time spent if promoting content or services. Look at qualitative feedback too through reviews or surveys. Use analytics to A/B test different strategies and fine-tune over time based on what works best for your goals and audience. With the right mix of tools, strategy and consistency, boosting followers on Facebook is very achievable for businesses.
