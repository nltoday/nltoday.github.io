### A Personal Experience
When I was younger, I was heavily invested in finding a good match through horoscope matching. I went through a difficult first marriage and engagement that ended poorly, despite having very high gun milan or horoscope matching scores. On the other hand, I met my now husband who had a much lower score but has turned out to be a loving, caring partner. Through this personal experience, I started questioning the validity and importance placed on horoscope matching for marriages.

### Horoscope is Not Destiny
While horoscopes can be fun to read for entertainment, there is no scientific evidence that the positions of stars and planets at the time of one's birth can determine the key events and relationships in their life. A person's character and the success of relationships depend more on their own attitudes, behaviours, efforts and compatibility with their partner. [Horoscope compatibility](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-good) is an uncertain yardstick that can mislead people into overlooking more important compatibility factors. Focusing too much on scores and doshas misses the human element that is crucial for a fulfilling marriage. 
### Flexible Cultural Practice Becomes Rigid Ritual
Horoscope matching was likely adopted as a cultural practice to facilitate arranged marriages in traditional societies. It provided an acceptable framework to consider proposals without overtly judging personal qualities. However, over time this flexible cultural tool has transformed into an inflexible ritual given undue importance. Younger generations today cling to vague horoscope predictions instead of objectively assessing a partner's character and compatibility. This over-reliance has harmed many relationships and lives by discounting real-life compatibility.
### Business of Horoscope Leads to Bias
The **fortune telling industry** in India is a multi-billion dollar trade that thrives on perpetuating beliefs in astrology. Professional astrologers thus have a conflict of interest in perpetuating the notion that horoscopes hold definitive answers. They may interpret charts in biased ways and even manipulate readings to create match/mismatch artificially in order to continue getting consulting fees. The ambiguity in astrological predictions allows twisting outcomes to fit any narrative. This compromises the objectivity needed to make important life decisions like marriage. 
### Taking Responsibility for One's Life
Instead of blaming fate or stars for relationship outcomes, it is healthier to take responsibility for one's choices and efforts. No compatibility system can compensate for two people's unwillingness to understand, support and invest in each other. Fulfilling long-term partnerships are built through mutual care, respect, communication and commitmentâ€”not destiny. While traditions need not be abandoned, it is time to adopt a more balanced, pragmatic approach to marriage that weighs compatibility holistically rather than getting fixated on arbitrary scores. Our lives are too precious to leave to vague astrological predictions alone.
### An Outdated Practice in Modern Times 
Arranged marriages served important social functions in traditional societies, but contemporary Indians enjoy more individualistic lifestyles and freedom of partner choice today. For the educated urban populations, **horoscope matching as a primary criteria for arranged marriage** has become an outdated practice with little relevance. Young adults are emotionally and financially independent,Travel the world and opt for love marriages more. A compatibility framework focusing only on planetary positions neglects evaluating important qualities like education, life goals, interests and personality matching in the modern context. We must evolve culturally appropriate practices that blend traditions with progressive thinking. 
### Towards A More Enlightened Approach
While traditions deserve respect, rigidly clinging to practices long after they cease serving useful social purposes holds us back. A balanced approach would be to treat horoscope as one minor input among many for compatibility assessment, instead of the overriding basis for decisions. Families must have open discussions to understand each other's perspectives better. And individuals need not feel pressured but take charge of their own relationships. With open-mindedness and compassion, we can reshape cultural norms to empower individual well-being and foster mutually fulfilling modern relationships.
