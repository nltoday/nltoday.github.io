### Understanding Key Concepts
Technical analysis plays a crucial role in picking the right stocks for intraday trading. Some key concepts to understand include volatility, liquidity, chart patterns, and breakouts. [Stocks with sufficient daily volatility](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-holiday-party-this-is-my-bernard-dog-christmas-pajama-2) above 2% and high liquidity measured in daily trading volume are preferable. **Chart patterns** like symmetrical triangles, ascending triangles, flags, and channels that indicate impending breakouts should be on the radar.

### Evaluating Daily Volatility and Liquidity 
Daily volatility reports from the National Stock Exchange of India website provides data to analyze volatility. The CSV file contains daily volatility values for over 1600 stocks that can be filtered in descending order. However, liquidity is also essential. Focusing on the top 100 stocks listed in the Nifty 100 ensures sufficient liquidity since they represent major sectors of the Indian economy. Microsoft Excel's VLOOKUP function helps extract the daily volatility data of Nifty 100 stocks. 
### Identifying Chart Patterns and Breakouts
Reviewing stock charts daily is required to spot potential **chart patterns forming near support and resistance levels.** Common patterns include symmetrical triangles, ascending triangles, flags, and channels. These patterns indicate **accumulation or distribution before a breakout**. The goal is to identify stocks displaying patterns with a high probability of an impending breakout. Studying how volume behaves around these patterns provides additional confirmation. Breakouts are trading opportunities that can produce **sizeable intraday moves** if entered timely.
### Utilizing Stock Screening Tools 
Free online stock screeners like [Stock Screening and Analysis Tool](https://www.screener.in) aid real-time scanning. Filters for daily volatility above 2%, average daily volume above 500,000 shares, and a 50-cent average true range assist with identifying **stocks in play.** Fundamental news catalysts pushing individual stocks are also noteworthy. Short interest data helps avoid heavily shorted stocks prone to manipulation. Scanners automate filtering thousands of stocks for timely opportunities conforming to parameters. 
### Considering Additional Factors
A stock's pre-market price action should be observed. Those **gapping up or down 2% or more** before the opening bell are potential movers. Unusually high pre-market volume combined with the catalyst increases the odds of volatility. Monitoring day-to-day price action assists with identifying **important intraday support and resistance levels.** Volume profile around these levels provides extra edge. Avoiding thinly traded stocks and those strongly correlated with overall market direction is advised.
### Example of an Intraday Trade Setup  
[India Bulls Real Estate](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/INE155H01022:NSE) displayed an intraday setup on a particular day. News emerged that the company sold a 50% stake, prompting the stock to plummet. Short sellers profited by recognizing and trading the breakdown. This illustrates **identifying a catalyst,** monitoring **price action and volume**, and taking advantage of **trend continuation**. Techniques like these, if applied systematically with strict risk management, can produce profitable short-term trades.
### Keys to Success in Intraday Trading
Adhering to filters for daily volatility, liquidity, chart patterns, breakouts, and catalysts is crucial when screening stocks actively. Using techniques like Fibonacci retracements and identifying support/resistance flip helps fine-tune entries and exits. Positive **risk-to-reward trades,** cutting losses quickly on reverses, and following trends closely are best practices. Paper trading new strategies allows perfecting the process before going live. With experience and discipline, **successfully implementing a methodical stock selection system** leads to consistent profits in intraday trading.
