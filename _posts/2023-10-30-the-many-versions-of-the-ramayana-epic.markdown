### The Original Sanskrit Version
It is believed that the sage [Narada](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/adkisson) was the original teller of the Ramayana story which he then passed onto **Valmiki**, who composed the Ramayana in Sanskrit. Known as the **Valmiki Ramayana**, this is considered the oldest version of the epic still available today. Valmiki's telling spans seven sections and follows the exploits of **Prince Rama** in rescuing his wife **Sita** from the demon king **Ravana**.
