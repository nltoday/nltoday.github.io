I knew that a strong academic profile would be crucial for my DAAD scholarship application. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I worked hard to maintain a high **CGPA of 3.8 out of 4**, consistently ranking near the top of my class. My professors provided strong letters of recommendation highlighting my leadership on research projects and passion for the field. Maintaining excellence in the classroom laid the foundation for my DAAD success.
## Communicating a Compelling Research Vision
For my 10-page proposal, I proposed researching the promising new **gene therapy technique CRISPR/Cas for treating Huntington's disease and cancers**. I knew selecting an in-demand field would capture DAAD's interest in funding impactful science. I outlined clear objectives, timelines, and referenced literature to validate my project's feasibility. Communicating a compelling vision for how my research could advance human health helped strengthen my application.
