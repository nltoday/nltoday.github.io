While copyright laws make downloading pirated games without permission technically illegal, prosecution is rare in many countries. Game companies focus more on cracking down on sites distributing pirated content than individual downloaders. **However, in some regions like the United States, prosecution is more likely if you're caught redistributing copyrighted games**. 
The risk of legal action against casual downloaders is generally low. Game companies see pirated downloads as a lost sale, so it's not cost-effective for them to pursue individual cases. They prefer to spend enforcement resources on larger operations. So unless you're sharing pirated content on a massive scale, your personal downloads are unlikely to draw legal attention.
### What About Security Risks?  
Security is a bigger concern than legal risks for individual game downloaders. **Pirated torrents and files could potentially contain malware like viruses, ransomware or cryptojacking malware without you realizing it**. Many illegitimate download sites intentionally include malware to compromise users' devices and networks.
Even from trusted pirate sites, there is no guarantee that uploaded files have been scanned for threats since quality control is lower. Simple downloads have risks, but using a [VPN or proxy](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-stocking-santa-chihuahua-dogs-christmas-socks-lights-xmas-424-chihuahua-dog) provides an extra layer of security by encrypting your internet traffic and hiding your true IP address from potential hackers on public networks.

### Asking Friends Is Safer
Rather than downloading from untrusted sources online, asking friends which **Popular games they enjoy legally** is a lower risk option. Friends you trust are less likely to share files containing malware. **Multiplayer games** in particular provide built-in social networks to discover new titles your friends are playing legitimately via online stores. 
Just be aware that in some places, sharing copyrighted content with others without permission could still pose a legal gray area depending on your local laws. Getting recommendations privately from close friends is lower risk than engaging in wide file sharing networks.
### Free Alternatives For Casual Gaming  
If you're just looking to discover new games casually without major investment, **free-to-play games** on stores like Steam provide valid legal alternatives to piracy. Many paid games also offer unlimited free trials or demos so you can get a feel before committing funds. 
Subscription services such as Xbox Game Pass on console or PC also give access to huge libraries of premium titles for a low monthly fee, making it worthwhile for frequent gamers vs pirating individual games. Especially for AAA blockbusters, the value is usually there at affordable price points through legal avenues.
### Weigh Risks VS Alternatives Carefully
In summary, downloading pirated games does carry legal and security risks, however light they may be depending on region and precautions taken. **For casual use especially, alternatives like demos, free games and subscriptions** provide valid ways to discover new titles without compromising security or running afoul of copyright law. Weigh the potential risks versus cost-effective legal options available to you.
