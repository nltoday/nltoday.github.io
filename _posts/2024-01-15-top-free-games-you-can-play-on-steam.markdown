TF2 teams you up with other players to take on objectives as one of nine unique character classes. Choose from archetypes like the Heavy, Spy, Pyro and more - each with their own weapons and playstyle. While TF2 launched with a fee, it went free-to-play in 2011 - and optional cosmetics, weapons and maps help keep the game fresh and funded.
