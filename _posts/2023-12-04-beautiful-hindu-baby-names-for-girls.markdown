### Special and Unique Blend
The name Anaisha was chosen by my friend for her 6-month-old daughter. Anaisha is a unique blend of her husband Ankit and her own name Esha. This beautifully represents the couple and signifies something special. My friend told me Anaisha means "special" or "alternate". She wanted a name that was one of a kind and represented her love for her husband.

### Neighbor's Inspiring Choice
My neighbor next door named her little girl Amara. I've heard this name used in many television shows nowadays. Amara has a timeless quality to it that is both elegant and easy to pronounce. It seems to suit my neighbor's cheerful baby girl perfectly. Another name I came across recently is Monalisa. This evokes imagery of the famous painting and carries an artistic flair.
