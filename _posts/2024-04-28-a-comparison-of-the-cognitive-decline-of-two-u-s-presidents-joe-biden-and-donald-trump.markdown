### The Concerns Behind Biden's Gaffes
Many have expressed concerns over Joseph Robinette Biden Jr.'s occasional verbal gaffes and what they could potentially indicate about his cognitive health. However, close observers note that Biden has dealt with a stutter his entire life which sometimes causes him to [lose his train of thought](https://store.fi.io.vn/sunflower-poodle-mom-dog-lover) or pick words to avoid stuttering, making his speech patterns appear disjointed at times. As someone who has watched Biden's political career for decades living near Delaware, the author insists these behaviors are not new and **Biden has always talked in this way**. While age has slowed him down some, at 80 years old he remains sharper than most and comes from a family with strong genetics for longevity.

### Trump Displays Greater Cognitive Decline
**Comparatively**, concerns over Donald Trump's cognition seem more substantiated. As the grandson of a man who suffered from Alzheimer's, Trump carries higher genetic risk factors for cognitive impairment. Additionally, medical experts warn obesity like Trump's puts one at higher risk of conditions like Alzheimer's. Those who have observed entire Trump speeches note sections appear like **nonsensical word salads with no coherent meaning**. This level of incoherency seems a change from videos of Trump in the 80s, indicating greater cognitive deterioration than Biden has shown according to close observers.
### Biden's Stutter and Chatterbox Personality
The author, having watched Biden's political career for over 50 years living near his home state of Delaware, provides important context about the politician. It was well known Biden had issues with stuttering his whole life, sometimes causing him to pause in speech to avoid certain words. However, Delaware voters **paid more attention to his political accomplishments** than small speaking flaws. Biden was also just **"an absolute chatterbox" who liked to talk everyone's ear off**, possibly losing his train of thought from time to time in conversations. These behaviors align with videos of Biden dating back 50 years, demonstrating his current speech is **consistent with his lifelong patterns rather than signs of impairment**.
### Biden Bounced Back From Past Health Issues 
In 1988, Biden suffered an aneurysm that did cause **noticeable cognitive slowing for a few years**. However, through determined recovery the author insists Biden **regained his full faculties after only a short period**. Now at 80, no one can match the sharpness of their youth but Biden continues **surpassing cognitive expectations for his age**. Hailing from a family with strong genetics where parents lived into their 90s, the author predicts **Biden will likely reach that milestone as well** given his healthy lifestyle and access to top medical care. Those familiar with dementias like the author can see Biden displays none of the typical signs.
### Comparing Trump and Biden's Changes Over Time 
For those wishing to make an objective comparison, viewing old videos provides valuable insights. Films of Trump from his frequent Letterman appearances in the 80s depict **a markedly different verbal presentation** compared to troubling sections within his modern speeches. Meanwhile, tapes of Biden dating back 50 years feature **the very same stutter and conversational mannerisms** seen today. This suggests the concerns over Trump stem from **real cognitive decline** rather than normal aging effects, unlike the case for Biden according to those with front row seats to both men's careers spanning decades.
### Distinguishing Decline Versus A Lifelong Stutter
It can be difficult to distinguish typical aging changes from worrisome signs of impairment. However, for those familiar with the subtleties of cognitive health, clear differences emerge between Biden and Trump's cases. While Biden's stutter caused disjointed moments his whole life, observers note **he has always been lucid and logically consistent**. Contrast that with the **bizarre, tangential segments within recent Trump speeches** that break from his past eloquence. For those knowledgeable about dementias like the author, these patterns indicate **likely cognitive deterioration** only in Trump, not Biden, who remains **cognitively intact** despite his advanced age. Characterizing Biden's lifelong stutter as decline misrepresents his stable presentation compared to real concerns around Trump.
### In Summary 
After decades of front-row observation, residents near Biden's home state know the patterns in his speech represent **a lifelong impediment, not an age-related decline**. Meanwhile, watching full recordings reveals **Trump has undergone substantial cognitive changes from his more coherent past**. For experts, these discrepancies clearly differentiate typical aging versus impairment. While neither man can claim the sharpness of youth, judgments on their cognition should consider each's lifelong **baseline versus deterioration over time** - with Biden staying consistent and Trump showing **worrying deviations** meriting medical review according to objective analyses.
