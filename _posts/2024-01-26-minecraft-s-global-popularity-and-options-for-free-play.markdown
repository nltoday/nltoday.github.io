### Worldwide Sales Surpass 180 Million Copies 
While free in China, **Minecraft has sold over 180 million paid copies globally** outside of the country's borders. This paid commercial version published by Mojang allows ongoing development and support for the game. The widespread commercial success points to passionate interest from players willing to invest in a premium experience.
### A Legitimate Demo Option for Testing the Game
For those interested in trying Minecraft but unwilling or unable to purchase it, **there is a legitimate free demo still available through an older version**. According to one player, launching the official Minecraft launcher and creating an account allows accessing version 1.2.5 labeled as a demo. This provides the full early gameplay experience at no cost legally. 
### Avoiding Piracy Preserves Development 
Of course, some may be tempted by pirated options promising a free full game. However, **piracy ultimately undermines the developers and sustainability of ongoing support**. By respecting Mojang's commercial model which allows continued updates and expanding the game, players ensure the experience can evolve for many years to come.
### Simple Tweaks to Address Potential Crashes
While piracy is discouraged, for anyone trying the legitimate demo, **a quick fix may resolve potential crashes - simply create a new folder and change the game's file location**. According to the player, this simple folder change frequently remedies instability issues when launching older demo versions on modern systems. 
### Updating to Latest Versions Unlocks Bonuses
Naturally, the free demo is limited to an outdated early build missing substantial new content. **Officially purchasing Minecraft provides access to vastly expanded worlds, hundreds of mobs, biomes, weapons, tools and creative possibilities**. Fans passionate about fully experiencing multiplayer and community realms will want to support ongoing innovation.
### Minecraft's Appeal Goes Beyond Games  
It's clear that Minecraft has attracted a zealous global following through its innovative **open-world crafting and construction mechanics**. However, its influence has expanded well beyond core gameplay. **School projects, maps, servers, and even educational tools harness Minecraft's potential to spark creative thinking** and collaborative problem solving. 
### Summoning the Courage to Support Future Updates
For any holding out from supporting Minecraft due to the cost, **consider rallying your courage to invest in boundless entertainment and learning**. Your contribution directly enables Mojang to sustain teams working on the betterment and expansion of the beloved program. **Have faith that you won't regret enabling the game's promising future.**
In conclusion, Minecraft has found colossal popularity through its flexible commercial model worldwide. While old demo versions allow a limited free trial, supporting ongoing development promises expanding value. With over 300 million already allured in China alone, this block-building behemoth shows no signs of slowing down given continued commercial backing from fans.
