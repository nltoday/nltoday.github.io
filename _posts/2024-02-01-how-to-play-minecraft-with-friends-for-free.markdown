### Using Demo Version
There is a legal way to play an older version of Minecraft for free by using the demo. Open the Minecraft Launcher and create an account. In the installations section, select version 1.2.5 from the dropdown and click "Play Demo". You will now have access to a full version of Minecraft from 2012 for free. [Although an older version](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-duck-gift-for-mom-mother-duckling-duck-waterfowl-lovers-v-neck-t-shirt/men&), it is still very fun and allows you to experience the core gameplay without spending any money.

### Installing TLauncher
If you want to play a more recent version of Minecraft without purchasing it, you can install TLauncher instead. TLauncher is a third-party launcher that allows you to run **cracked versions of Minecraft** for free. Once installed, you can select any version from the dropdown and start playing singleplayer worlds right away. However, **there are some limitations** when it comes to multiplayer as not all servers support cracked clients.
### Using Aternos for Multiplayer
To play multiplayer with friends using a cracked version of Minecraft, the best option is to host a server using Aternos. Aternos is a free web hosting service that allows you to easily create and manage **Minecraft servers in the cloud**. All you need to do is sign up, give your friends the server IP address, and you can start playing together right away. Within the Aternos control panel, you can configure server options like making it **"cracked"** so that only cracked clients can join. This allows all your friends using TLauncher to connect without buying the game.
### Limitations of Cracked Servers 
While Aternos allows cracked players to enjoy **LAN-like multiplayer experiences**, there are some popular servers that do not support cracked clients for legal reasons. Large servers like **Hypixel** require a genuine/premium account to play as they do not condone piracy. Many mini-game and roleplaying servers also block cracked users. So if you want to explore a wide variety of multiplayer maps and game modes, eventually purchasing an account may be worthwhile. However, Aternos is perfect for occasional LAN parties with friends who don't own the game.
### Other Free Multiplayer Options
If you don't want to deal with hosting a server yourself, there are some smaller public servers that do allow cracked users. Websites like BlockDrop offer mini-game servers that can be accessed for free. However, server stability and performance may vary compared to established servers that only host premium players. Alternatively, you could set up a LAN world and invite friends over using the same local network for low-latency games. Overall, Aternos provides the best immediate solution for **reliable free multiplayer among friends**.
### Summary 
In summary, while the paid version of Minecraft is required to access all multiplayer content, there are still some free options available for playing with friends. The demo version allows experiencing the original game for free. Cracked launchers like TLauncher enable the latest versions at no cost, and Aternos leverages the cloud to set up dedicated servers for LAN-style games between cracked users. With the right setup, you can definitely enjoy Minecraft multiplayer without spending any money upfront.
