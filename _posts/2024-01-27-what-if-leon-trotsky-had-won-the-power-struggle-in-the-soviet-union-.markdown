### The Early Years of Soviet Leadership
Following the October Revolution, [Vladimir Lenin](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/ager) and the **Bolshevik party** established control over the newly formed Soviet Union. However, Lenin's health began declining in 1922 and it was clear that a succession struggle would soon ensue. The two main candidates were **Leon Trotsky** and **Joseph Stalin**. Trotsky was an intellectual revolutionary who had helped organize the Red Army during the Russian Civil War. However, he lacked charisma and social skills. Stalin, on the other hand, was a pragmatic political operator who had proven skills in organization.

### Trotsky's Vision for Global Communism
Trotsky adhered strongly to the Marxist-Leninist philosophy of **Permanent Revolution**, which called for constant efforts to spread communism worldwide through both internal and external revolutions. He believed communism could only succeed on a global scale. Had Trotsky come to power, he likely would have pursued more aggressive foreign policies to foment communist uprisings in other countries like Hungary, Germany, and Poland after World War 1. He may have provided support to communist rebellions in places like Romania, Spain, Brazil, Chile, and El Salvador in the 1920s-30s.
### Industrialization and Collectivization Under Trotsky
Rather than implementing Stalin's policy of **Socialism in One Country**, Trotsky would have prioritized Lenin's **New Economic Policy** which utilized limited private enterprise to revive the Soviet economy. However, Trotsky still would have pushed for rapid industrialization and the nationalization of private land holdings. While he opposed Stalin's harsh methods, Trotsky believed agricultural collectivization was necessary to fund industrialization. Peasants would have faced pressure to join collective farms, though without mass violence and confiscations of grain.
### Preparing for War with Fascism 
Once Adolf Hitler rose to power in Germany, Trotsky correctly identified the grave threat posed by fascism. Unlike Stalin, he would not have pursued the **Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact** with Nazi Germany. Trotsky likely would have built up Soviet military strength earlier and urged Western allies to form a united front against Hitler. If war broke out, Trotsky's strategic skills could have led to more decisive early victories against Nazi armies. The Soviet Union may have expanded further into Eastern Europe to secure defensive buffers, though without installing totalitarian puppet regimes.
### An Alternative Outcome of World War 2
Had the Soviets pursued a more aggressive foreign policy under Trotsky's leadership, World War 2 may have started earlier. A stronger communist bloc emerging from the war could have altered the subsequent dynamics of the **Cold War**. Western democracies like the United States and United Kingdom might have perceived the Soviets as a graver global threat. Trotsky also may have tried spreading revolution to additional countries rather than allowing a buffer of neutral states to form. This could have made confrontation between communist and capitalist ideologies more likely. The world could have been split between two broadly hostile camps for decades.
### Would Trotsky Have Purged Dissent? 
As a fervent believer in Marxism-Leninism, Trotsky likely would have still sought to crush political opposition and impose Communism by force. However, he lacked Stalin's paranoid instincts and may not have orchestrated **The Great Purge** that killed millions. Political prisoners would still have filled **Gulag labor camps** under Trotsky, albeit to a lesser extent than under Stalin. Selective use of terror and repression to maintain one-party rule would have continued, though mass killings of whole classes or ethnic groups were not in Trotsky's character. Over time, some political relaxation may have been possible as the Soviet system stabilized.
### Trotsky's Vision for a Global Communist Society
Had Trotsky presided over a victorious Soviet Union after World War 2, he would have tried instigating further communist revolutions in war-torn Europe and Asia. Nations like Italy, Greece, Korea, Vietnam, and Indonesia may have fallen fully or partially under communist control. Trotsky likely would have exported Soviet-style communism to fellow "people's democracies" and backed revolutionary movements across the **Third World**. Over decades, he may have succeeded in slowly spreading communism on a truly global scale through a variety of ideological, economic, and military means. This could have made the twentieth century one of capitalist-communist ideological bipolarity on an even grander scale.
### Trotsky's Long-Term Influence and Legacy
Whether Trotsky's vision for global communism could have ultimately prevailed is difficult to say, given the many uncertainties involved. Over the long run, the virtues of open societies and economic freedom may have still triumphed over totalitarian rule. However, Trotsky's leadership could have conceivably yielded a drastically reshaped geopolitical landscape, with vast implications for human history. While a deeply flawed individual, Trotsky left a lingering intellectual influence as one of the seminal Marxist thinkers of the twentieth century. His name remains cemented in our understanding of communism's rise and the Soviet Union's turbulent early decades.
# In Summary...
Trotsky's substitution for Stalin would not have removed authoritarianism or repressive policies entirely from Soviet governance. However, his ideological fervor, militancy, and strategic acumen could have led the USSR to even greater heights of global power in the mid-twentieth century. While this may have strengthened communism's reach worldwide for some time, long-term outcomes are difficult to foresee. What is clear is that Trotsky's victory in the power struggle would have significantly altered the trajectory of both Soviet and world history in profound and unpredictable ways. Though speculative, considering this major historical "what if" offers insight into communism's past and the contingency of global events.
So in summary, while still highly authoritarian, a Trotsky-led Soviet Union may have won World War 2 more easily and been even more globally assertive during the Cold War, possibly leading to a prolonged period of bipolar capitalist-communist rivalry rather than the eventual capitalist triumph of our timeline. Assessing this counterfactual scenario highlights both the personal factor in leadership successions and how alternative pathways could have drastically reshaped twentieth century geopolitics.
