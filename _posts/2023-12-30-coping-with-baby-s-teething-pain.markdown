### Relief through Drooling and Gum Massage
Teething can cause significant discomfort in babies as their new teeth break through the gums. One of the most notable signs is increased drooling, as drooling is the body's natural way to soothe irritated gums. Teething stimulates excess saliva production, so parents can expect to find more saliva coating baby's chin, hands, clothes, toys and anything else within reach. Rather than seeing it as a chore to constantly wipe drool away, try to view it as baby's way of finding **self-soothing relief**.

### Irritability and Crankiness from Tooth Pain 
Along with drooling, teething babies often become more irritable, fussy or cranky. The pain of new teeth pushing through can disrupt sleep and appetite as well. Babies may wake more at night, nurse or feed less eagerly and have difficulty settling back down for naps. Teething pain can radiate to the ears too, prompting extra ear pulling or rubbing. To offer comfort, try rubbing or gently massaging baby's **swollen, tender gums** with your clean finger. The light pressure may help diffuse some of their discomfort.
### Alternative Teething Relief Methods
For babies who just want something to gnaw on, approved teething toys and rings kept in the fridge can chill teething gums. Look for BPA-free, durable toys that are easy for little hands to hold. Raw carrots or chunks of frozen banana also make great popable, chewy alternatives to teething on hands and clothes. Cool [teething necklaces](https://store.fi.io.vn/french-bulldog-frenchie-dog-black-dog-lover-frenchies-1) soaked in water or freezer packs that are safe for oral use may deliver soothing cold therapy as well. Gentle gum massages and teething toys are usually the top choices for calming a teething fussbudget. 
### Coping with Lack of Appetite and Sleep Issues
When gums are swollen and painful from cutting new teeth, feeding and sleeping difficulties are common side effects. Babies may become less interested in nursing, bottle-feeding or eating solid foods. Their gums simply hurt too much to comfortably latch on or chew. To help boost appetite, try cold compresses on the outside of cheeks before feeding or chilled **teething foods**. As for sleep, frequent waking is to be expected with teething discomfort. Maintaining a calming bedtime routine and offering soothers or light gum rubbing may coax them back to sleep faster. Stay patient, as both appetite and sleep usually return to normal once teeth fully emerge.
### Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen for Severe Tooth Pain
If teething symptoms like extreme fussiness or difficulty sleeping persist for more than a few nights, parents may opt to give infant acetaminophen/paracetamol or ibuprofen following medical guidance. Both can safely lower fever and reduce mild to moderate pain from new teeth breaking through. Consult your pediatrician first on proper doses based on baby's age and weight. These medications should never be given at the maximum dose or without doctor approval. Consider them only on those particularly rough nights of **teething fever** and inconsolable crying. Otherwise, stick with non-medicated relief methods at home.
### When to Worry About Atypical Teething Symptoms
Most babies endure teething with the basic signs described. However, if behaviors suddenly change in concerning ways or symptoms seem more severe than age-appropriate, consult the pediatrician. For instance, teething alone would not typically cause a very high fever over 101 degrees Fahrenheit, a rash that keeps spreading or vomiting and diarrhea. Other potential red flags include seizures, labored breathing, neck stiffness or a soft spot on the skull appearing swollen or bulging. Having a medical professional examine an unusually ill-appearing or lethargic baby brings reassurance that all is well or rules out potential underlying issues needing treatment.
### Teething Will Pass, Try Gentle Remedies For Now
The phase of early tooth emergence, while difficult at times, is generally short-lived. It may take several weeks or months for that first tooth to finally peek through, but babies seldom teeth for more than a year or two. Staying calm and employing calming strategies tailored to each little one's needs will sooner or later carry families through to the other side of teething's toughest periods. With patience and compassion for their discomfort, parents can provide the relief babies seek through simple remedies that aid in managing symptoms naturally.
