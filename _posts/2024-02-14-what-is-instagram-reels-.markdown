### Understanding Reels
Instagram Reels is a short-form video feature that allows users to create and share 15-second videos set to audio on the Instagram platform. Reels gives users creative tools like audio, text, effects, and stickers to make entertaining videos that can keep viewers engaged. Reels aims to provide a space for users to showcase their talents through fun, creative videos similar to TikTok.

### Finding and Discovering Reels
In addition to sharing Reels to their own profile, users can also share Reels to Instagram's dedicated [Reels discovery](https://store.fi.io.vn/hurt-my-chihuahua) feed located at the top of the Explore page. This gives Reels exposure to a wider audience beyond just a user's followers. Viewers can scroll through this feed to discover new and trending **Reels content** from popular accounts on Instagram. Tapping the first Reel at the top of the page brings you into the endless Reels feed.
### Integration with Instagram
A key difference between Reels and stand-alone apps like TikTok is that Reels is integrated natively into the existing Instagram platform. This allows users to easily create, edit, and share Reels without needing to switch between different apps. Users can create Reels and share them to their profile so their existing Instagram followers can view the videos in their regular feed. Reels also have the option to be shared to Instagram Stories, reaching an even larger potential audience.
### Building an Audience with Reels  
By leveraging Instagram's large user base, Reels provides creators an opportunity to get their content discovered and attract new followers. Creators can experiment with different visual concepts, audio options, and editing styles to make entertaining and engaging **Reels videos**. As more viewers discover and enjoy their Reels, the videos will gain higher **Reels views**. Over time, consistently posting high-quality Reels is a strategy some creators use to build up a dedicated following interested in their unique style and perspective.
### Interacting through Likes and Comments 
When viewers come across Reels they enjoy in the Explore feed or on a creator's profile, they have options to directly interact with the videos. Tapping the like button is one way for viewers to show support and interest in the creator's content. Leaving a comment allows for back-and-forth discussion between the creator and their audience. These engagement metrics through likes and comments give valuable insight to creators on what type of content resonates most with their viewers. It also influences the reach of individual Reels videos as Instagram's algorithm favors Reels that garner high engagement.
### Monetization Opportunities for Creators
As the Instagram platform and its creator community continue growing, Instagram is exploring more direct monetization features for popular accounts. One example is the ability for select creators to add links to their Instagram bios where viewers can purchase products related to the content. This opens up revenue opportunities for creators through affiliate marketing. Over time, experts predict Instagram may also roll out e-commerce integrations or advertising features specifically for high-performing Reels similar to how YouTube compensates popular video creators. As the Reels format evolves along with its monetization options, creators have an compelling opportunity to grow sustainable creative careers on Instagram through their unique Reels content.
In conclusion, Instagram Reels provides a platform for expressing creativity through fun and engaging short videos. Creators can leverage Reels tools to produce content that entertains audiences and draws in new followers interested in their perspective. As Reels continue developing monetization paths, committed creators have strong potential to build long-lasting communities and careers centered around their Reels videos on Instagram.
