Understanding customer acquisition costs for your e-commerce business is crucial for measuring profitability and planning growth. However, calculating the true CAC can involve understanding many interconnected factors. Let's break down the key considerations and offer approaches for analysis.
### Looking Beyond Ad Spend
Many e-commerce businesses only look at advertising expenditures when calculating CAC. However, as noted previously, this misses related operational expenses that contribute to acquiring customers. When determining CAC, consider including costs like:
- Personnel expenses like marketing team salaries that support acquisition activities. These teams drive awareness, optimize ads, and nurture leads.
- Overhead expenses allocated to new customer attraction like office space, software, and hardware used by acquisition teams. 
- Non-advertising efforts that still drive traffic like content creation, [SEO optimization](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-duck-gift-for-mom-mother-duckling-duck-waterfowl-lovers-v-neck-t-shirt/women&), social media engagement, public relations, and events. These take team time and resources.
- Portions of management time spent overseeing the acquisition strategy and analyzing results. Their efforts help refine the approach over time.
Gaining a holistic view of all costs helps understand profitability realistically and improve your true CAC over time.

### Factor in Repeat Customers 
It's essential to exclude costs associated with acquiring existing, repeat customers when calculating your true first-time CAC. Repeat customers have already been "acquired" previously and generally re-purchase with lower friction.
To isolate costs for new customers, analyze which visits, orders, and revenue came from repeat email addresses and payment methods. Filter these out to focus purely on prospects completely new to your brand. This shows the expense required to find each virgin customer.
### Consider Unit Economics
Evaluating CAC also requires understanding your company's unit economics. This involves assessing:**average order value (AOV), product costs, fulfillment expenses,** and contribution margins per order. 
For example, if your true CAC is $50 but the first order's contribution margin is only $40, you aren't profitable yet on initial customers. Factor unit economics into CAC analysis to ensure plans will lead to sustainability.
### Calculate over Time Horizons
While the initial acquisition cost is important, many e-commerce companies don't break even until a customer's second or even third purchase. To plan accurately, calculate CAC over the average customer lifetime rather than just their first transaction. 
Estimate the cumulative potential revenue from repeat purchases and judge CAC based on the average number of orders it takes to recover expenses and become cash-flow positive on that customer. This longer-term view considers your true customer value.
### Testing Assumptions with Tracking
To continuously refine your CAC understanding, integrate granular tracking and analytics. This includes tagging different customer types, attribution modeling to attribute touchpoints correctly, and testing new channels, creatives and bids to compare performance. 
Testing assumptions through ongoing optimization helps justify spend, discover lower-cost channels, and lower your true CAC over the long run based on proven tactics. Don't rely on estimates - let data guide your analysis.
### Use Benchmarks Cautiously  
While benchmarks provide useful guides, your true CAC depends heavily on specifics like products, positioning, marketing channels, and customer lifetime behaviors that benchmarks can't capture on their own.   
Consider benchmark ranges just as a basic check rather than strict targets. Instead, focus your analysis primarily on comprehensive tracking and testing within your own business over time to continuously refine your true understanding of costs.
### In Summary
Gaining an accurate view of customer acquisition costs is a complex undertaking for e-commerce companies dependent on continued growth. Taking a holistic view incorporating all expense factors, lifetime customer value, and real business metrics offers the clearest picture for optimizing the balance between profitable growth and sustainable budgets over the long term.
