### Dietary Changes Can Help Protect Your Kidneys
Making changes to your diet is one of the best things you can do to help support your kidney health and potentially heal damage. Reducing salt intake is crucially important as salt raises blood pressure, placing extra strain on the kidneys. [Avoid adding salt when cooking or at the table](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/ahl) and steer clear of processed foods, which are notoriously high in hidden salt. Focus on whole, fresh ingredients to prepare simple, flavorful meals from scratch.

### Staying Hydrated Is Vital for Kidney Function
Drinking plenty of **water every day is essential to flush toxins from the kidneys and prevent dehydration from worsening damage**. Aim for at least 8 glasses or around 2 liters total. **Water is the number one beverage choice** - cut out caffeinated drinks like coffee, tea, soda, and energy drinks, as they are diuretics that dehydrate you. Proper hydration also helps thin out the urine to decrease risks of developing painful kidney stones. 
### Limiting Protein Intake May Help in Severe Cases
When kidney function is severely impaired, it’s best to consult a renal dietitian to determine the appropriate level and sources of protein. High protein diets place an extra burden on damaged kidneys trying to process waste. Good options are plant-based proteins from beans, lentils, nuts and seeds. Protein from meat and dairy should be limited or avoided depending on your kidney function test results.
### Exercise Regularly for Overall Kidney Health
Light to moderate **exercise can help control blood pressure naturally without medications**. Even just 30 minutes per day of walking has benefits. Strength training 2-3 times a week also helps reduce stress on the kidneys long term. Talk to your doctor about an exercise plan that’s suitable for your fitness levels and any other health conditions. Staying active supports kidney function and may aid the healing process of minor damage.  
### Quit Smoking and Limit Alcohol Intake
Smoking cigarettes severely harms the kidneys long term and slows healing. It’s best to quit entirely if you have kidney problems. Excessive alcohol also stresses the kidneys by dehydrating the body. Men should limit to no more than 2 drinks daily and women to 1 drink if drinks are consumed at all with kidney disease.
### Herbal Remedies May Help in Mild Cases
Some herbal supplements with purported kidney benefits worth trying under a doctor's guidance include **dandelion, marshmallow root, and turmeric** which have anti-inflammatory properties. 6x roasted Korean bamboo salt taken for 2-3 months as mentioned may help reverse mild failure in some cases too according to testimonials, but more research is needed. These natural options are generally well-tolerated but check for interactions with any prescription medications. 
### Managing Stress and Getting Rest Aid Recovery  
High stress puts extra strain on the body and Kidneys. Find healthy ways like meditation, yoga or time with loved ones to lower cortisol. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep nightly too **- rest supports healing.** Manageable lifestyle changes can certainly help protect kidney function long term in combination with medical care. Following these natural strategies typically poses little risk but you should always check with your doctor first before making any major dietary changes when dealing with kidney disease.
