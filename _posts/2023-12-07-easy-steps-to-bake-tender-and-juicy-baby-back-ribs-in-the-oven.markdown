Every barbecue lover knows that tender and fall-off-the-bone ribs are a mouthwatering delight. While grilling ribs over an open flame is a classic cooking method, baking ribs in the oven is a hassle-free alternative that delivers flavorful results. This multi-part guide provides a detailed yet simple process for preparing moist and tender baby back ribs in the oven from start to finish.
## Prepping and Seasoning the Ribs
The first and most important step is to properly prepare the ribs for baking. **Start by removing the thin silvery membrane from the back of the ribs with a paper towel.** This allows the seasonings and sauce to penetrate the meat fully during baking. ***Pat the ribs dry with paper towels*** to ensure the seasoning adheres well. Generously season both sides of the ribs with your preferred homemade or store-bought **dry rub mixture containing salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder and other favorite spices.** Allow the seasoned ribs to sit at room temperature while preheating the oven to promote flavor absorption.
## Wrapping the Ribs for Extra Moisture 
Many dedicated grillers and pitmasters use the so-called "**Texas Crutch**" technique of wrapping ribs in heavy-duty foil partway through cooking. This steaming process keeps the ribs extra tender and juicy. To employ this method for oven-baked ribs, generously wrap the seasoned ribs in heavy-duty foil after the initial hour of baking. Seal the edges with folds to prevent moisture from escaping. Continue baking wrapped ribs for the remainder of the cooking time.
## Slow Baking for Tender Texture
Once seasoned and optionally wrapped, it's time to slow bake the baby back ribs. Preheat the oven to a moderate 275Â°F to allow for slow, low-heat cooking. Place the ribs meaty-side up on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. This allows fat and juices to drain away from the meat during cooking. Bake ribs uncovered on the center oven rack for 2 to 3 hours, until very tender when tested with a fork.
## Finishing and Saucing the Ribs
For ribs with an extra layer of **savory-sweet barbecue flavor**, brush or sprinkle your favorite sauce over the baked ribs during the final 30 minutes of cooking. Heat sauces containing ingredients like **vinegar, molasses, brown sugar and tangy mustard** intensify the rib's taste. For a baked-on bark or exterior crust, unwrap the ribs if using the Texas Crutch method during this high-heat finishing stage. Check for doneness by verifying the ribs bend easily without resistance. Allow the fall-off-the-bone ribs to rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.
## No-Fuss Clean Up
Baking ribs in the oven provides several benefits over outdoor grilling. Not only is it mess-free, but it also allows effortless cleanup. To streamline oven-baked rib preparation even further, place the ribs on a broiler pan fitted with a wire rack over a rimmed baking sheet. This setup collects rendered fat and leftover juices during slow baking. Simply dispose of the broiler pan contents after cooking for a virtually no-fuss kitchen. Enjoy fall-off-the-bone oven-baked baby back ribs with your favorite sides for a delightful low-effort barbecue feast.
