## Expert in **Indian art and culture** 
### Neeraj Rao Sir

## Skilled at **Geography teachings**
### Tajesh Govindraj Sir  
Tajesh Govindraj Sir has been effectively sharpening the Geography skills of Vision IAS students.

## Room for improvement in History **faculty**
### Himanshu Khatri Sir
While Himanshu Khatri Sir puts effort towards teaching History, some students feel the quality can be enhanced further. His lectures provide a basic understanding but lack depth on certain topics and periods. The **syllabus coverage is satisfactory for Prelims but limited for Mains**. Himanshu Khatri Sir's teaching pace is moderate and there is scope to make lessons more engaging with visual aids and activities. Although he strives to resolve doubts, students have complained about insufficient individual attention. Given History's importance, aspirants require a faculty who can equip them comprehensively with analytical and application-based skills. Vision IAS needs an expert educator who can strengthen this crucial subject area.
## Core subjects **training could be better** 
A common suggestion is that the Vision IAS faculty for certain core subjects like Environment and English needs strengthening. While teachers aim to cover the syllabus, their grasp over topics and ability to impart an in-depth, exam-oriented understanding requires upgrading. The teaching style is considered average with less stress on transacting higher-order thinking skills. Students often feel the need to rely more on self-study for these areas. Moreover, some teachers are unable to adequately address doubts due to lack of subject command. Vision IAS must evaluate existing faculty profiles, prioritize upgrading those in weaker areas and appoint experienced educators who can bolster aspirants' core subject learning.  
## Conclusion
In summary, Vision IAS has cultivated a renowned team of educator mentors especially for subjects like Polity, Economics, Geography and Art and Culture. Top faculty like Amil Sir, Pratik Gupta Sir, Neeraj Rao Sir and Tajesh Govindraj Sir are highly recommended based on their grasp over content, effective teaching approach and capability to resolve doubts. However, there is potential for augmenting certain faculties teaching History, Environment and English to further optimize learning outcomes. Vision IAS must continually assess their dynamic faculty requirements to equip every aspirant with an optimal exam preparation experience. Constant improvement of pedagogy, syllabus coverage and individual attention can strengthen this top coaching institute's reputation for success consistently.
