## Practical Fashion Sense
A wise old saying defines fashionability across time: Women will wear clothing for as long as it remains in style, while men consider clothing stylish as long as it remains wearable. This adage proves timeless, though styles certainly evolve. My parents demonstrated living by these principles throughout their lives in the 1950s and beyond. 
### An Unfashionable Hat
In 1957, Mother decided her hats had grown outdated. "Mine are out of style. I'll find a modern replacement." Father disagreed. "They look fine. Why spend extra?" Mother insisted styles change. "Yours is from our 1938 wedding. It's now old-fashioned." Father stubbornly replied, "As long as moths don't ruin it, this will do." With a sigh, Mother set off alone to shop.

### Updating With Care
Rather than constantly buying new, Mother creatively updated her hats. She repressed, trimmed brims, changed ribbons and added silk flowers or feathers to freshen dated styles. Once yearly, Father brought his lone hat to be professionally cleaned, believing this maintenance sufficient. Practicality triumphed over following every fleeting trend.
