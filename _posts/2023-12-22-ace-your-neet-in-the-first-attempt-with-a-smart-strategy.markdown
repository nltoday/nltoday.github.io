### Biology is the Key to Success
[Memorizing NCERT](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/puppy) is crucial for scoring high marks in Biology. The NCERT textbooks contain all the important concepts and facts that are asked in the exam. By thoroughly reading and understanding the NCERT at least 10 times, you will have a strong grasp of the concepts. Make flowcharts and sticky notes of tough topics to remember them easily. Conducting small quizzes with friends is also very helpful as it will reveal gaps in your preparation. Along with NCERT, practice as many previous year question papers as possible to improve your speed of solving MCQs under pressure. Aim for at least 340+ marks from Biology which will give you a strong base score.

### Master Physical Chemistry With Practice
Physical Chemistry involves both conceptual clarity and rigorous practice of questions. It is important to attend all lectures to understand formulas and their applications. Read the NCERT textbook 2-3 times along with solving every example, illustration and exercise given in it. This will help cement the concepts. Make formula sheets for quick revision. Give special attention to chapters like Surface Chemistry and Solid State by reading their NCERT portions multiple times. Solve previous years' questions from NEET as well as JEE Main to cover a wide variety of topic-wise questions. With focused preparation of at least 200 questions per chapter, 140+ marks from Physical Chemistry are very much achievable. 
### Use Smart Techniques for Inorganic Chemistry  
While **Inorganic Chemistry** has a sizeable amount of information to retain, understanding fundamental concepts first will reduce the memory workload. Listen carefully in classes and note important facts. Read the NCERT at least 5 times without just mugging up but trying to comprehend trends. Make charts and fact sheets for quick revision. Only refer coaching material for developing concepts, not rote learning extras. Give equal focus to scoring as well as last chapters on daily liferelated topics. Aim for at least 140 marks after consistent practice of NEET and JEE Main question banks.
### Master Organic Chemistry With Mechanisms and Practice
Organic Chemistry requires understanding **reaction mechanisms** along with memorizing structures and names. Carefully learn important mechanisms from NCERT along with reactions, structures, IUPAC nomenclature and isomerism chapters. Refer coaching material judiciously without exceeding the NCERT syllabus. Make short notes to memorize reactions like aldol condensation, elimination etc. Thoroughly solve illustrations, examples and exercises from NCERT. Practice previous years' questions daily with interconversion questions involving different chapters. With focused preparation, 140+ marks are very achievable in Organic Chemistry. 
### Physics is Doable With Smart Study Plan
Developing strong **fundamental concepts** is key to scoring in Physics. Attend all lectures to learn important question-solving techniques and tricks. Read the NCERT once thoroughly with special focus on illustrations, examples, points to ponder and numericals. Make short revision notes of chapters. Practice questions rigorously, with a target of at least 200 questions per chapter. Give equal importance to last scoring chapters. With regular practice from question banks of NEET as well as JEE Main, 140+ marks can be scored in Physics. 
### Follow General Tips for Overall Success
Apart from subject-wise preparation, it is important to **maintain discipline, healthy routines and have proper rest. **Aim for at least one full-length mock test every weekend to evaluate preparation and identify weak areas. Target your preparation strictly as per NCERT without wasting time on excess materials. Keep practice and theory reading in balance. Aim high and you will achieve your goal with smart strategies and hard work in your first attempt itself.
