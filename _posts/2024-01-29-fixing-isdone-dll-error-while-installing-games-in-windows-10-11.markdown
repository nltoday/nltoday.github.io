### Common Causes and Solutions
There are several common causes and solutions for the isDone.dll error that may occur when installing large games or software on Windows computers. This error usually means that the installation process is unable to unpack and extract necessary files due to issues with system resources like memory (RAM) or hard disk space. Let's take a look at some potential causes and fixes.
[RAM and disk space requirements](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-chihuahua-rainbow-unicorn-lgbtq-ally-dog-lover-mom-dad-v-neck-t-shirt/men&). Many games have significant minimum **RAM and disk space requirements** specified on the product page. Before installation, ensure your system meets or exceeds these specs. Not having enough available memory or storage can cause unpacking failures leading to isDone.dll errors. Run the Windows Disk Cleanup tool or uninstall unused programs/games to free up space. 
**Antivirus interference**. Overzealous **antivirus programs** may interfere with installation files and trigger isDone.dll errors. Temporarily disable your antivirus and try installing in safe mode with networking where only essential processes run. Re-enable antivirus after a successful installation. 
**Corrupted files**. Installation files can become corrupted during downloads. Ensure you have the **complete and correct installation package** by redownloading from the official source. Check file integrity with a verification tool if available.

### Increasing Virtual Memory
The Windows page file, also called virtual memory, is used to supplement physical RAM. Insufficient virtual memory can cause isDone.dll errors. Increasing the page file size provides more "memory" for installation processes.
To increase virtual memory, open system properties, go to the advanced tab and click "Settings" in the performance section. Select the "Custom size" radio button and increase both the initial and maximum size values to around 3000MB each. This dedicates up to 6GB of hard drive space for virtual memory use during installations. Restart your PC for the changes to take effect.
### Replacing DLL Files
Corrupted or missing DLL files like isDone.dll and unArc.dll can disrupt extractions. Replace them manually by downloading fresh copies from trusted sources. 
Search Google for the file, right click "Save As" to extract it from the download archive. Navigate to the Windows/System32 folder, backup the original DLL files first before pasting the replacements. Run "Regsvr32 filename.dll" in an administrative command prompt to register the new DLLs. Restart and try installing again.
### Cleaning Temporary Files
Leftover temporary files consume disk space and memory that installations require. Use the Disk Cleanup tool to delete the contents of the Temp folder where cached files accumulate. Freeing up disk space in this manner can resolve isDone.dll errors. 
Run Disk Cleanup, select the "Clean up system files" option and launch the cleanup process. Go to This PC > Local Disk (C:) > Windows > Temp and manually delete all files and subfolders within Temp to fully remove cached content.
### Checking System Files 
Corruption in core system files can interfere with the unpacking process. Use the System File Checker (SFC) tool to scan for and fix broken important Windows files.
Open an administrative command prompt and enter "sfc /scannow" to initiate the System File Checker. Let it fully scan your system and repair any integrity violations found before retrying the installation. For stubborn issues, also run DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth to repair Image files.
### Installing in Safe Mode
Booting into Safe Mode prioritizes memory and resources for installation over unnecessary startup programs and services. This improves chances of successful unpacking.
Restart your PC and continually tap the F8 key during early startup to access the Advanced Boot Options menu. Select "Safe Mode" or "Safe Mode with Networking" and try installing in this constrained environment.
### Checking Hardware
On rare occasions, hardware issues can underlie isDone.dll errors. Use manufacturers' diagnostics tools to check for problems with physical memory (RAM) or hard drives. Bad sectors on storage can corrupt installation files. Replace defective components if issues are detected.
Ensure optimal hardware performance to avoid resource constraints preventing installations from completing successfully. Test memory with Memtest86 and hard drives with CrystalDiskInfo or manufacturer drive diagnostics.

### DLL File Registration
Another potential fix is re-registering the DLL files using the Windows Registry Editor. This refreshes the file associations and path locations for isDone.dll and unArc.dll in the system.
Press Windows + R to open the Run dialog, type "regedit" and press Enter to launch the Registry Editor. Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID` and search for the entries containing references to isDone.dll and unArc.dll. Right click and select "Delete" to remove the old registry keys for these files. 
Next, open an administrative command prompt and enter `regsvr32 isdone.dll` followed by `regsvr32 unarc.dll` to re-register the DLLs. This refreshes their status in the registry. Restart your PC and retry installing the game.
### Clean Reinstallation
For troublesome errors, completely uninstalling and reinstalling the game with a clean installation folder provides a fresh start. 
Uninstall the game via Control Panel, browse local and roaming user profiles to manually delete remaining folders. Download a fresh copy of the installation file, right click "Run as Administrator" and select a new destination folder like Desktop for extraction. This rules out potential file/folder permission issues.
### Contacting Support 
If the above solutions don't address persistent isDone.dll errors, the final step is contacting the game publisher or software developer support teams for customized assistance. Provide system details, error messages and steps tried so far to aid diagnosis of your specific issue. Their technical resources may uncover subtle fixes for your unique configuration.
With patience and methodical testing of these common solutions, the isDone.dll blocking most game installations can usually be resolved. Let me know if any part of the process requires clarification or if you have additional questions!
