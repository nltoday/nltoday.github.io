### Taking Action
When I turned 27, I found myself unemployed for over a year and sleeping on a friend's couch. I felt painfully single and wondered if it was too late to change trajectories. With no work experience or clear direction, motivation was low. 
That's when I asked my dad for advice. He simply said "You can't steer a parked car." Those words inspired me to stop wondering and start doing. I refocused my job search on [small growing companies](https://store.fi.io.vn/ugly-christmas-sweater-funny-french-bulldog-dog-unicorn) rather than large established ones, believing a startup would provide more opportunities. 
After facing rejection from over a dozen applications, I landed a customer service role at an interesting company called **Bonobos (company)** [https://www.quora.com/topic/Bonobos-company]. There, I found 25 smart, fun co-workers just getting started. I contributed across departments and eventually identified my strength in a new **career path in e-commerce**.

### Finding Fertile Ground 
Starting small allowed me to figure things out. I recommend the same - look for **fertile ground** where your energy and capabilities can take root rather than expectations. Young companies need people who care more than those with experience. While **startups require long hours**, the mission and quality of one's work can make it feel like a lifestyle.
### You Only Need to Get Lucky Once
I was lucky to find my place at Bonobos. Maybe you'll get lucky too. But there's only one way to know - take action instead of waiting. As long as you keep putting yourself out there, luck will come. It's easy to feel it's too late at 27, but I'm living proof it's never over.
### Intention Over Circumstance
Most success isn't achieved in your 20s. That's usually accidental based on birth advantages. True success comes from intentionality - deciding your goals and putting in the work. New careers can be built in less than a decade. If you love something enough, age won't matter. Stay focused on enjoying the journey.
### Fun Trumps Fear
If you're not having fun on your path, you'll never enjoy the destination. Compare yourself to who you were yesterday instead of others. Don't live with regret or anxiety - spend time with people you love doing work you love. Let your journey be the success. Easier said than done, but faking fun is a good start. 
### One Good Hit Is All You Need
For creatives, it may take many tries to find success. But remembering all it takes is one hit can fuel persistence. Think of famous authors who struggled for years before making it big. You just need to get lucky once. Keep putting yourself out there and increasing your odds of that lucky break. There's no time limit on success.
### Embrace Uncertainty 
The only thing certain is uncertainty. You may succeed at 32, 37 or 42 instead of 27. As long as you're enjoying the learning, delays don't matter. Focus on the present moment instead of some imagined future. Let loose of expectations for a clear path. Exploration and growth, not arrival, is the point. With that mindset, life's enjoyment expands tremendously.
### It Starts With A Step
Looking back, taking that first customer service role was a small step that unlocked so much. I was simply willing to start somewhere instead of waiting for the perfect opportunity. Begin the same way - take any step that puts you in motion. From there, your innate abilities will surface and evolve in unexpected directions. Your story is just beginning.
