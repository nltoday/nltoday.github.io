Friends and family members not being able to see your public Instagram reels on Facebook can certainly be annoying. However, there are some explanations for what may be happening and steps you can take to try and resolve it. Here are some insights into this common issue and potential fixes.
### How Instagram Reels are Shared to Facebook
By default, public Instagram reels are automatically shared to your Facebook profile or page if you have linked your Instagram and Facebook accounts. This cross-platform sharing is designed to make it easy for followers on both networks to see your content. However, there can sometimes be delays or bugs that prevent timely sharing between the platforms. 
Facebook and Instagram use specific algorithms to determine what gets shown in people's feeds based on factors like their prior interactions with your account. So even if a reel is public, someone's news feed prioritization may mean they don't see it right away. The platforms are also constantly tweaking their algorithms, which could unintentionally cause sharing issues for some periods.

### Checking Privacy and Sharing Settings 
One thing to check is your Instagram and Facebook privacy and sharing settings to confirm reels are set to public and your accounts are properly linked to allow cross-posting. Go to your Instagram settings, then tap "Account" and "Linked Accounts" to confirm Facebook is selected for sharing. On Facebook, check your profile and page settings also allow shared posts from Instagram to be visible. Outdated or incorrect settings could block the intended visibility.
### Reporting Issues to Get Support 
If settings look correct but the problem persists, as you've already done, the next step is to report the issue directly to the platforms for troubleshooting. Explain the specific problem clearly when contacting [Facebook support via the help center or app](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-holiday-santa-riding-rottweiler-dog-christmas-2). Provide details on when the issue started, which accounts are involved, and if you've tried any fixes. Support teams need thorough reports to properly diagnose technical problems or bugs. You may also want to separately contact **Instagram support** in case it's an issue isolated to that platform.
### Trying Alternative Ways to Share on Facebook  
As a temporary workaround, you could download your reel as a video file from Instagram and natively post or share it directly on Facebook. This bypasses the automatic cross-posting process which may be faulty. Other options include sharing the Instagram reel link on Facebook or creating Facebook posts mentioning the new reel went live on Instagram. Creative alternative methods can still help connected followers be notified until any technical glitches are addressed.
### Being Patient While Bugs are Resolved

Staying engaged with customer service can help get updates on progress resolving the specific sharing challenge you're facing too.

While waiting for a resolution, another productive strategy is looking for new ways to creatively tell stories and engage your audience across channels. Consider posting longer written updates, live videos, question stickers or polls on Facebook to complement the visual storytelling of Instagram reels. Try weaving conversations between platforms to keep connections strong even if technical glitches temporarily disrupt intended cross-posting. With some patience and alternative creative approaches, the sharing issue should subside over time as support works on fixes behind the scenes.
### In Summary
Bugs preventing Instagram reels from appearing on followers' Facebook feeds can definitely be annoying but usually aren't intentional. By thoroughly checking settings, clearly reporting issues, exploring workarounds, and bringing some creative social strategies - the roadblocks should eventually be addressed.
