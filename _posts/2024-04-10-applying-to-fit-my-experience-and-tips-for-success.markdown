### My FIT Journey
I began attending FIT in 2013 as a freshman, pursuing a degree in graphic design. Coming from a small high school, I was attracted to FIT's prestigious program and location in New York City. The application process was fairly straightforward - I wrote a two-page essay about my design experience and goals for the future. While I had average grades, I felt my passion for the field came through in my writing. To my delight, I was accepted for the following fall semester. 
Over the past five years at FIT, I have had the opportunity to take a wide variety of [creative electives](https://store.fi.io.vn/cute-axolotl-funny-i-axolotl-questions-salamander-265/women&) including photography, illustration, and web design. The curriculum has challenged me while also allowing space for self-directed learning.  I have strengthened my technical skills through core classes like digital imaging and typography. FIT's studio culture and location in Manhattan have also exposed me to working **design professionals** and potential career opportunities. While the coursework requires discipline, I have enjoyed my time exploring different areas of design. FIT has helped me to refine my interests and visual style. I am on track to graduate this spring with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in graphic design.
