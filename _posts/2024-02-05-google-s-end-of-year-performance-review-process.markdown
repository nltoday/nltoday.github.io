### Conducting Self-Assessments
Every six months, Google employees are required to conduct a self-assessment of their work and achievements over the past period. This involves summarizing major accomplishments, contributions to projects, and personal/professional development. Employees describe their strengths aligned to their job responsibilities and career ladder, as well as areas for improvement going forward. For example, a senior engineer may discuss leadership of an impactful new project as a key strength.

### Gathering Peer Feedback
Employees choose 3-8 peers who can comment on their work, such as fellow engineers or managers, to provide peer reviews. Managers may also assign additional reviewers for less experienced employees. Peers evaluate an individual's [code quality](https://yt.io.vn/collection/acheson), **teamwork abilities**, and more. They offer direct feedback to both the employee and their manager. This input factors into performance ratings and promotion eligibility. 
Peers also rank engineers within their team on a scale. Those ranked higher demonstrate skills and contributions above their level, while lower rankings indicate below level performance. This total ranking determines bonuses and promotion cutoffs across the team.
### Preparing for Promotions   
For those applying to advance in their career ladder, the review allows detailing why they deserve a promotion. Strong applications emphasize **specific accomplishments** and examples showing the applicant meets expectations for the next level through **contribution details and technical expertise**.
### Enabling Manager Feedback Meetings
Managers use self-assessments, peer reviews, and other contextual insights to evaluate individual performance. Formal review meetings involve an in-depth discussion focused on development, not mere ratings. Managers coach employees on strengths, weaknesses, and goals for continuous skills growth.
### Transparency Throughout the Process  
Employees have access to all feedback and evaluations shared in their reviews for transparency. The process aims to identify strengths while constructively addressing weaknesses through goal setting between employees and their reporting managers.
### Outcome Determinations
Outcomes include setting OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) for the upcoming review period, identifying development areas, and determining variable compensation and promotions when applicable. The system focuses on individual merit rather than competition to establish fair outcomes.
### Valuing Continuous Feedback Cycles  
Rather than a single annual event, Google's performance reviews constitute an ongoing feedback process. Regular check-ins allow addressing strengths and weaknesses in real-time. Overall, the model emphasizes career growth through transparent, development-centric feedback from managers and peers.
# Conclusion
Google's performance review system aims to drive professional development through constructive feedback between all parties. Its transparency, focus on goals rather than ratings, and emphasis on ongoing coaching sets it apart from traditional annual review models. By soliciting input from managers and peers, it offers a holistic perspective on an individual's performance and potential. This developmental approach supports employees in continuously improving and advancing their careers.
