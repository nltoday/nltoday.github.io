Upload videos with desktop browser to avoid Instagram's compression
Instagram allows users to share videos on the platform. However, the audio quality may suffer after uploading due to compression. Here are some tips to maintain audio quality when sharing videos on Instagram:
### Upload videos through desktop browser 
Instagram offers higher upload limits when using a desktop browser compared to the mobile app. The app has a size limit of under 3MB for videos to prevent compression. However, using a desktop browser bypasses this restriction. This allows uploading larger, higher quality video files without Instagram compressing the audio.
Many people find the audio sounds [horrible](https://store.fi.io.vn/game-controller-christmas-for-video-gamers-boys-kids-455/women&) or **muffled** after uploading through the app. To avoid this, access Instagram through the browser on your desktop or laptop computer instead. Make sure to switch to "Desktop View" in the browser settings first before uploading the video. The larger file size threshold means the original audio quality is preserved.

### Downsize video resolution and frame rate
While uploading through desktop avoids app compression, the file size still needs to be managed. Large, high definition videos will still get compressed by Instagram to optimize loading speeds. Reducing the resolution and frame rate is a good way to decrease file size without drastically impacting quality. 
Most smartphones have a max video resolution of 1080p. Downsizing to 720p keeps it viewable while cutting the file size. Similarly, reducing the frame rate from 60fps to 30fps halves the data without a noticeable visual difference for most vides. These tweaks ensure the file remains under 3MB for smoother uploads and retention of **rich, detailed audio**.
### Consider converting to lower quality formats
If the video is still too large after downsizing resolution and frame rate, converting the file format may further cut its size. High quality formats like ProRes or high bitrate H.264 produce large files. Converting to a lower bitrate H.264, or even more compressed formats like HEVC/H.265 can shrink a file significantly.
Of course, this comes at the cost of visual quality losses. But for static videos where high resolution isn't critical, it's a viable option to keep precious **audio clarity** intact for Instagram. Proper conversion settings aim to only minimally impact quality while achieving the necessary file size goals.
### Extract audio and re-import as background music 
For videos with critical dialog or vocals where compression really degrades quality, consider separating the audio track. Extract it from the original video file using video editing software. Then re-import the clean audio file as background music in Instagram. 
The separated audio file can now be compressed at a higher bitrate since it's no longer constrained by the video. Upload both video and audio parts separately. In your Instagram post, add the clean audio track behind the compressed video. This keeps the **pristine sound** while still sharing the full video content.
### Limit effects, transitions and complicated edits
Advanced video editing with complex effects, transitions and overlays can significantly contribute to large file sizes. Keeping a video raw and simple helps reduce its data footprint. Limit visual effects only to crucial elements. Remove transitions if they don't meaningfully contribute to the story. 
Simpler editing styles allow higher compression levels without Quality losses. This ensures the limited mobile data rates can still handle streaming the video fluidly. Most importantly, it prevents Instagram from compressing away the valuable **beautiful sounds** in pursuit of optimization.
In conclusion, using a desktop browser, limiting resolution/frame rate and simplifying edits are effective ways to upload Instagram videos while retaining excellent audio quality. Proper file size management is key to avoiding app compression that ruins the listening experience. With a bit of tweaking, Instagram can still be used to share high quality video content with pristine sounds.
