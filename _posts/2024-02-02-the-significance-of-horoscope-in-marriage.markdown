## The Story Begins
Coorg, Karnataka, 1996. Mr. D, a retired military man in his 50s works at a local photocopy shop to keep busy. He is looking for a suitable match for his daughter, Ms. S, a beautiful and elegant young lawyer in her early 20s. 
Mangalore, Karnataka. Mr. M is an ambitious lawyer in his 30s who is also on the lookout for a life partner. He hears about Ms. S from an old friend and decides to visit Coorg to see her for himself. 
### A Chance Encounter
On his trip to Coorg, Mr. M spots Ms. S at the local court. It was love at first sight. He knew she was the one. Before returning home, he drops by Mr. D's photocopy shop to introduce himself. Unfortunately, the power goes out during their brief interaction, leaving an unfavourable first impression on Mr. D.

### An Eloquent Appeal
Back in Mangalore, Mr. M pens a persuasive letter to Mr. D, detailing his intentions and **seeking Ms. S' hand in marriage with admirable determination and tact**. Impressed, Mr. D agrees but insists on horoscope matching as the next step.
## A Stroke of Genius
Mr. M, a non-believer of astrology, pays a local astrologer to **fabricate a horoscope that perfectly aligns with Ms. S' chart**. He presents this to Mr. D, who consults two astrologers for their opinion. 
### Approval from an Ally 
The first astrologer detects issues and advises remedial rituals. Sensing an opportunity, he suggests performing a costly prayer ceremony. 
### A Second Opinion Confirms the Match
Mr. D solicits a second reading. This astrologer confirms it is an [auspicious union with no apparent conflicts or imbalances in the horoscope charts](https://store.fi.io.vn/cinco-de-mayo-cinco-de-mayo-shirt-chihuaha-chihuaha-shirt-funny-chihuahua-funny-chihuahua-shirt4345-t-shirt). Reassured, Mr. D gives his blessing for the engagement.
## A Happily Ever After, or so it Seemed
The couple ties the knot after six months of engagement. They go on to have two daughters and celebrate over two decades of **marriage marked by mutual trust, respect and companionship** - or so it appeared from the outside. 
### But Behind Closed Doors 
In reality, Mr. M's wife lacked affection and respect for his family. Frequent quarrels spoiled their relationship. Despite a seemingly **perfect horoscope match**, astrology failed to predict the incompatibility in their temperaments and values.
## Learning from Mistakes
The disillusioned husband now believes **compatibility cannot be determined by astronomical positioning alone.** Had he listened to his heart rather than horoscopes initially, he may have found true love and avoided the trauma of divorce. His advice - trust your feelings over fate. The real **signs are in human emotions, not cosmic arrangements**.
### Horoscopes - Guidance or Gospel?
In concluding, while astrology provides insightful perspective, it should never **supersede personal judgement or chemistry.** The story highlights how horoscope obsession can steer one wrong. Free will and compatibility matter most in marital success.
## The End. Or a New Beginning?
Today Mr. M and his ex-wife have separated amicably. Though the past leaves regret, he takes this as a **lesson learned.** The future is unwritten, and what truly determines our destiny are the daily **choices we make for happiness.**
