## From Despair to Victory
### [The Third Failure of Falcon 1](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/adamczyk)
On August 2nd, 2008 SpaceX launched its third flight of the Falcon 1 launch vehicle from their test site in Kwajalein Atoll. The first stage flight went perfectly, clearing the most difficult parts of the mission. However, shortly after the stages were meant to separate, the video feed cut out, indicating something had gone wrong. The 350 employees of SpaceX anxiously awaited news from the mission control trailer. 
When Elon Musk emerged, he acknowledged the difficulty of the task and reassured the team that SpaceX had sufficient funding to attempt two more launches. Most powerfully, he declared "I will never give up" and rallied the team to continue the fight. This display immediately energized the weary staff with new determination.

### **Lightning-Fast Investigation and Recovery**  
Within hours, SpaceX's world-class engineers identified the likely cause of failure. Typically investigations take weeks or months, but the team combed through every data point. By August 6th, results were publicly announced with full transparency. Remarkably, a new rocket was built, integrated and ready just 7 weeks later, when most need 6 months.
### **A Historic First**
On September 28th, 2008 SpaceX achieved the first ever **orbital launch** by a **privately-developed rocket**, the Falcon 1, from Kwajalein Atoll. This enormous accomplishment placed them amongst an elite group of only six nations to reach orbit. Victory was all the sweeter for overcoming such adversity.
## The Heart of a Leader
### **An Relentless Work Ethic**
Elon Musk pushes himself to extreme limits, working 70-80 hour weeks for years on end. He possesses a drive and commitment unmatched in industry. 
### **Unwavering Vision**  
Where others see obstacles, Musk sees opportunities. Repeated failures do not deter his long-term strategic thinking towards making humanity multi-planetary.
### **Demanding Excellence** 
Musk expects the utmost from himself and those around him. He drives uncomfortable growth, ultimately strengthening individuals and companies. Growth only occurs outside one's comfort zone.
### **Leading From The Front** 
Rather than manage from an office, Musk actively contributes to technical problems on factory floors and launch pads. This hands-on approach inspires deep loyalty in his teams.
## Inside the Mind of a Visionary 
### **Scarily Intelligent**
With an off-the-charts intellect, Musk thinks on a whole other level, envisioning ambitious technological leaps decades ahead of their time.
### **Vulnerable Yet Tenacious**
Despite successes, Musk remains dissatisfied, forever pushing further. He exposes vulnerabilities to rally others during failures yet emerges undeterred each time.
### **A Singular Focus** 
By concentrating on problems of existential importance like climate change and space colonization, Musk mobilizes passion and talent on a grand scale. 
### Determined to Win
His competitive nature drives continuous improvements, ultimately achieving the "impossible" through sheer force of will. By refusing to accept limits, Musk expands what is possible for humanity.
