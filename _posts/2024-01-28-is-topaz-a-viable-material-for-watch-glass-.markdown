## The Properties of Topaz 
Topaz is a naturally occurring gemstone known for its desirable properties like hardness and appealing colors. Composed primarily of aluminum silicate with traces of elements like fluorine, [topaz crystal structure](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-riding-shark-jawsome-dog-lover-gifts-space-galaxy-chihuahua-dog) gives it a rating of 8 on the Mohs hardness scale, making it extremely scratch resistant. However, its crystal structure also allows it to cleave or split quite easily along planar defects when subjected to pressure or impact.  
This unique combination of properties - hardness without toughness - make topaz an intriguing material for certain applications but not without some significant drawbacks. While its mineral hardness on par with quartz protects against scratches and abrasions extremely well, topaz lacks the fracture toughness of harder gemstones commonly used for watch crystals.
## Synthetic Topaz Through Chemical Vapor Deposition 
One way to make topaz more accessible for industrial use is through synthetic production. As the holder of a patent for creating **synthetic aluminum fluorsilicate topaz** via chemical vapor deposition, I developed a process that deposits crystalline topaz layers atom by atom on a substrate in a low-pressure chamber. This allows for control over factors like purity, color and size to a degree not possible with natural topaz gemstones. 
Synthetic topaz produced this way could overcome issues with natural topaz supply and availability. However, the fundamental material properties of hardness without toughness remain. While synthetically manufactured topaz may have certain advantages in optical applications that benefit from its desirable refractive index and transmission properties, its tendency to cleave poses challenges for withstanding impacts encountered during everyday wear and use in timepieces.
### Potential Issues for Watch Glass Durability  
One major drawback of using topaz as a watch crystal material is its cleavage planes. Even a **small nick or flaw** from routine wear and abrasion could trigger propagation of a crack along these planes and compromise the structural integrity of the crystal. Unlike toughened minerals like sapphire that crack resistively, even a small impact has potential to cause catastrophic fracturing in topaz. 
Additionally, edge impact or blunt force trauma common during accidental drops or collisions could essentially split the topaz watch glass in two along its natural crystal defects. While extremely scratch resistant on a microscopic level, macroscopically topaz lacks the "ordinary toughness" needed to withstand such mishaps that happen to watches during normal use over time.

## More Suitable Watch Crystal Materials 
Given topaz's tendency to cleave, most watchmakers avoid relying on it as the primary watch glass material. Instead, mineral glass, sapphire crystal and other engineered minerals are commonly used depending on the watch's intended application and targeted market segment:
### Mineral Glass for Mid-Range Watches
Being amorphous instead of crystalline gives ordinary silica-based mineral glass higher ductility and fracture resistance than topaz despite lower hardness. Its lower material cost also contributes to broader availability in mid-priced timepieces. 
### **Sapphire Crystal for Luxury Watches**  
Corundum in its sapphire form has a 9 rating on the Mohs scale, surpassing topaz. More importantly, its hexagonal crystal structure breaks in a conchoidal manner rather than cleaving, making sapphire one of the toughest natural materials. This earns it a role as the premium watch crystal option able to withstand serious impacts.
### Other Engineered Materials
New zirconia and aluminum oxide composites leverage properties of multiple minerals for unique combinations of hardness, optical clarity and fracture toughness optimized for technical or specialized timekeeping applications. Lacking natural flaws, they avoid weaknesses like cleavage intrinsic to gemstone materials. 
## Topaz Utilization May Be Limited  
In summary, while topaz has qualities desirable for a watch crystal like scratch resistance Comparable to sapphire, its easy cleavage poses challenges for durability. Unless further processed or alloyed to alter this vulnerability, topaz may remain confined to applications less demanding than a watch's crystal experience over its lifetime of impacts. 
Its synthetic producibility through chemical vapor deposition opens some potential utilization, but more robust options exist. For most practical purposes and product positioning, topaz is not broadly viable as a primary watch glass material today due to its combination of very high hardness with low fracture toughness. Better choices that tolerate incidental damage without catastrophic failure are favored for dependable timekeeping until topaz treatments mitigate this shortcoming.
