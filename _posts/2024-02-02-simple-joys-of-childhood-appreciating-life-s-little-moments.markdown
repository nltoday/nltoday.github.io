Having observed the two children engaging in make-believe play at the bus stop, traveling alone on a crowded train, and seeing creative posters promoting cleanliness, this experience highlights how children find happiness in simple pleasures and develop resilience even in challenging circumstances.

When waiting for the bus, the young girl used a stick to pretend taking selfies like adults do with phones. Though her family likely couldn't afford the latest devices, she was content creating her own fun. Witnessing children's natural creativity, we're reminded that expensive toys aren't necessary for joy. A stick sparked imagination just as well as costly electronics might. Their brother soon joined in the game, showing children readily share pretense.
