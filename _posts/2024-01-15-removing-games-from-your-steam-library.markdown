## Understanding Digital Rights Management on Steam
Digital Rights Management, or **DRM software protection,** is how Steam verifies game licenses and ensures only authorized users can play games purchased through the platform. When you buy a game on Steam, it becomes permanently tied to your Steam account. Steam acts as the central hub that must be used to install, launch and play the game. 
### How Steam Verifies Game Ownership
Steam uses your login credentials and game files stored in your library to confirm you own the license. This prevents piracy by restricting access only to the account that purchased the game. Even if you back up game files externally, you still need a valid Steam login to play since key installation and launch components are handled through the client.

## Options for Accessing Purchased Steam Games
### Playing Games Offline 
You can play Steam games without an internet connection by switching your account to "Offline Mode" in the Steam client. This allows local game launching and play for up to 30 days without verifying against Steam's servers.
### Steam Library Backup and Restore
The Steam backup tool lets you save game package files and settings to an external drive. You can then restore the backup on another PC to avoid redownloading large titles. Remember that you still need to log into Steam to launch restored games.
## Permanently Removing Games is Not Possible
### Games Remain Tied to Your Steam Account
Unfortunately, once purchased, Steam games cannot truly be deleted or removed from the platform. Clicking "Remove from Library" locally uninstalls the game but does not delete your license. The title will remain accessible to redownload at any time from your account history. 
### Only Steam Support can Remove Game Licenses 
The only way to fully remove a game is by submitting a help ticket to Valve explaining your request to terminate licensing rights. However, they generally do not accommodate removal of legitimately purchased titles.
## What to Do About Pirated or Illegally Obtained Games
### Refrain from Playing Pirated Content
The best approach is not to play any games in your library that were obtained through unauthorized means such as piracy. Playing pirated games contributes to harming the industry and is against Steam & developers' Terms of Service.
### Contacting Steam Support for Assistance
You can explain the situation politely to Steam Support and ask them to investigate any pirated titles associated with your account. Provide evidence of legitimate game purchases as well to demonstrate your good faith. Steam may remove offending content and warn or suspend accounts involved in piracy.
## Ways to Clear Space in Your Steam Library
### Filter and Hide Unwanted Games  
Rather than complete removal, you can filter titles out of your library views using the default tagging system. Apply a "Hide" tag en masse to games you don't want to see regularly.
### Remove Local Game Files
For storage management, right-click on games you no longer play and select "Delete Local Content." This clears download data but retains your license to reinstall later from Steam.
### Take Stock of Your Backlog Regularly
Periodically review your library and remove any "Hide" tags from games you may want to play again in the future. Culling your backlog keeps your library tidy and focused on titles you actively enjoy.
## Maintaining a Curated Digital Game Collection
### Organize Your Library with Custom Tags 
Apply descriptive custom tags beyond the defaults to better organize your collection, for example by genre, playtime, rating, etc. This improves library navigation. 
### wishlist Track Upcoming Releases 
Stay on top of new games you want by adding them to your public or private wishlist. This prevents impulse purchases and keeps a backlog of things to check out later.
### Regular Spring Cleaning Keeps Things Tidy
Going through your library with a fine-tooth comb every few months ensures only desired content remains visible and installed locally. An organized collection is easier to manage both spatially and financially.
## Conclusion
While truly removing games from your Steam account isn't an option due to digital licensing, there are measures you can take to better curate and filter your library contents over time. With regular maintenance and careful selection of displayed titles, you can maintain control over your digital game collection on Steam. Always check platform policies regarding ownership rights before removing content to avoid issues.
