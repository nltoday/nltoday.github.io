### Opening Moves
In the summer of 1990, tensions were rising between Iraq and neighboring Kuwait over oil production quotas and allegations of slant drilling into Iraqi oil fields. On July 25th, [Iraqi President Saddam Hussein](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-stocking-santa-chihuahua-dogs-christmas-socks-lights-xmas-424-chihuahua-dog) summoned US Ambassador April Glaspie to the presidential palace in Baghdad to discuss the ongoing border disputes. However, **Hussein did not reveal his plans to invade Kuwait**, instead inquiring about US views on Iraqi-Kuwaiti relations.
During the meeting, Glaspie stated "we have no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border dispute with Kuwait." This would later be interpreted by Hussein, and many others, as the US giving a green light for military action. However, Glaspie's cables back to Washington portrayed the exchange very differently, with no indication she believed an invasion was imminent. The ambiguous nature of their discussion left room for misunderstanding on both sides.

### Planning Breakdown 
On August 2nd, 1990, **Iraq launched a full scale invasion of Kuwait**, catching US intelligence by surprise. **Iraqi military leaders were not consulted** in the planning. When Lt. General Nazar Al-Khazraji and other senior officers were informed the occupation was complete, they had no advance knowledge or ability to provide counsel. The invasion plan was devised solely by **Saddam Hussein, his cousin Ali Hassan Al-Majeed, and son-in-law Hussain Kamil** - none of whom possessed formal military training.
This top-down, unilateral approach disrupted the normal military planning process. Officers were expected to simply carry out orders without questions or alternative perspectives being considered. It also meant Hussein would micro-manage battlefield decisions, regardless of technological or strategic changes since World War I that his dated tactics did not account for. This breakdown in planning and consultation severely hindered Iraq's ability to effectively respond as the US-led coalition fought back.
### Airpower Revolution 
In the opening days of the coalition air campaign, it became clear **Iraqi forces were wholly unprepared for the capabilities of modern airpower**. One senior Iraqi air force commander emerged from a meeting with Hussein in disbelief. **The president instructed pilots to simply "see, aim, and shoot" enemy fighters** without any discussion of tactics for surviving advanced radar and missile technology. 
As bombing continued around the clock for over a month, **US forces employed new precision weapons like Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) that could hit targets with incredible accuracy from higher altitudes**. Coupled with near-total air superiority, this allowed the systematic destruction of Iraqi logistics, infrastructure, and any movement across the open desert. **Estimates put coalition bombing at 100 times the level of World War II**.
### Entrenchment and Attrition 
With supply lines cut and no support from the air, **over 250,000 Iraqi troops dug in among Kuwaiti and Iraqi border areas**. However, **their strategy merely aimed to extend the conflict and exhaust public support at home**, not achieve military victory. Officers buried troops alive in trenches and bunkers to slow the inevitable US-led invasion. 
Hoping to relieve pressure, **Hussein ordered jets flown into Iran where many crashed in the mountains**. Meanwhile, **coalition bombing took on more lethal roles** such as using daisy cutter bombs to bury Iraqis under collapsed sand. By late February 1991 after 6 weeks of the air campaign, estimates indicate up to **60-90,000 Iraqi casualties** with units in complete disarray.
### Highways to Destruction 
On February 24th, 1991, **US-led coalition ground forces entered Kuwait and southern Iraq** with minimal resistance. **Iraqi troops had been abandoned to their fate**, left without orders under constant bombardment. Over the next 3 days, **a horrendous episode known as the "Highway of Death"** took place as coalition aircraft methodically engaged any remaining Iraqi military vehicles fleeing northward on the Basra-Kuwait highway and adjacent roads. 
With limited options to surrender, **tens of thousands of Iraqi conscripts were wiped out** in gridlocked traffic under bombardment. **Remains were bulldozed into mass graves in the desert**. Though a military success, the lopsided killing drew condemnation as a potential war crime. It demonstrated both the lethality of US airpower without constraint, as well as **the desperate circumstances Saddam Hussein had placed his forces in through poor military planning and direction**.
### Lessons Learned
In the aftermath, coalition casualties remained light compared to most estimates - approximately 300 killed versus estimates of 10,000-30,000. Iraqi casualties were believed to exceed 100,000 though tolls vary. **The first Gulf War highlighted the revolution of airpower** and what modern technology could achieve with air superiority. 
**Iraqi military leaders sought to wage a long war of attrition but were crippled** before meaningful resistance due to lack of strategic foresight and micromanagement from above. **Future adversaries took note that tactics from generations past were obsolete**. Though victorious, **the devastating loss of life from the "Highway of Death" left enduring questions aboutproportionality in warfare** that continue today. Ultimately, **miscommunication between US and Iraqi leadership helped enable a conflict that need not have occurred**.
