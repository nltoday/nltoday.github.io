### Discovering My Passion 
I grew up in a small town with little career guidance. In my final year of college, I happened to watch the inspiring Bollywood movie "[Lakshya](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-christmas-quote-cartoon-chihuahua4050-t-shirt)" which made me think deeply about pursuing something meaningful. The impact of that movie pushed me to take a bold step after graduation. I borrowed money from friends and family and moved to Delhi to study for the **Common Admission Test (CAT)** exam.

### Facing Rejection After Rejection
When I arrived in Delhi, I sought guidance from friends on managing expenses while prepping for CAT. They suggested getting a job at a call center. At the time, the **call center industry** was booming with opportunities. However, getting my first job proved difficult as I faced rejection after rejection from one consultancy to another. Whenever I felt low, I rewatched "**Lakshya**" for motivation to keep trying. 
### Finally Landing My First Job
After **25 unsuccessful interviews**, I was thrilled to receive an offer letter for my first job at a domestic call center, albeit with a very small salary. Though the pay was low, I was grateful for the opportunity. This job allowed me to manage my living expenses while continuing to study and improve my skills.
### Moving Up the Ranks
Over the next decade, I steadily advanced in that company, taking on bigger roles and responsibilities. I gained valuable professional experience and rose through the ranks to become **Head of Operations**. In August last year, I left that job to start my own business, where I now employ **70 people**. All this began with that first small call center role that gave me a foothold in the industry.
### Finding Love Through Dance
Around the same time, I watched the rom-com "**Along Came Polly**" which featured a shy character learning salsa dancing to impress women. Inspired, I took Latin dance classes, hoping to replicate the movie scene. Although learning to dance proved very challenging, I persisted for over a year until I mastered salsa. Eventually I performed with a team and met my future wife, who was also on the team. We have a daughter today and are living a happy life together, all thanks to that simple movie's influence.
### How Two Films Shaped My Destiny 
Those two movies - "**Lakshya**" and "**Along Came Polly**" - profoundly impacted my life in unexpected ways. One inspired me to chase my dreams fearlessly while the other introduced me to a new passion and the love of my life. Both films gave me the courage to take risks, face rejections bravely, and continuously improve myself. They showed me that unexpected opportunities can arise from anywhere if we remain open and persistent. Today, I am fulfilied running my own growing business - all because of the motivation two movies provided during uncertain phases of my journey.
### Paying it Forward 
Now, whenever I meet enthusiastic young people unsure of their path, I share my story to encourage them. I believe anyone can achieve success through focus, resilience and an open mindset. I also support key skills and leadership programs in my community to provide career guidance lacking in my own childhood. It gives me great joy to pave the way for others as '**Lakshya**' and '**Along Came Polly**' did for me years ago. My life's twist of fate is proof that movies have the power to ignite dreams and change destinies in the most surprising ways.
