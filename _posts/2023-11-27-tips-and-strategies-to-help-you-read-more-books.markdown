## Make Reading a Priority  
As we get busier with work, family, and other commitments, reading for pleasure often gets pushed aside. However, making time for books is important for both mental stimulation and relaxation. Here are some effective ways to prioritize reading.
### Carry Books Everywhere
[Always have reading material on hand](https://yt.io.vn/collection/akridge) so you can squeeze in pages whenever you get a spare moment - waiting for an appointment, on your commute, during lunch breaks. Keep various formats like physical books, ebooks on your phone or tablet, and audiobooks for listening while doing chores or exercising. That way you'll never be without something to read.

### Schedule Reading Time  
Block out **dedicated reading sessions** each day, whether it's 30 minutes first thing in the morning or before bed. Stick to your schedule even on busy days. Treat it like any other commitment in your calendar. Once it's planned, you're less likely to give up that time for other less important tasks.
### Start Small with Short Books
If you're just starting to read regularly again, don't pressure yourself with long, daunting novels. **Choose short, easily digestible books** at first so you can enjoy completing them quickly and stay motivated. As you get back in the reading habit, you can tackle bigger books.
## Organize Your Reading 
Keeping your reading materials organized helps you make the most of your time and stay engaged with various stories. Here are some organizational tips.
### Make Lists on Goodreads  
Use the Goodreads app or website to compile lists of **books you want to read, are currently reading, or have finished.** Having your reading log in one easy-to-access place prevents you from forgetting about or losing track of partway through books. 
### Take Notes as You Read
Jotting down **brief notes on key points and thoughts** as you read keeps you focused and lets you easily recall details later. Use a dedicated reading notebook or notes app on your phone or tablet. Highlight or star especially noteworthy passages you may want to revisit or discuss with others.
### Organize by Genre or Mood
**Group your reading material by genre, subject area, or mood** to make choosing your next read effortless. For example, have separate shelves or folders for fiction, nonfiction, feel-good stories, educational books, and more. Browsing categories helps you pick up the perfect book for your interest at any given time.
## Improve Your Reading Experience
Making small adjustments to how you physically read can boost comprehension, retention, and enjoyment. Consider these reading experience enhancers.
### Limit Distractions  
Find an **undisturbed reading spot** where you can fully immerse yourself, whether it's a quiet nook at home or local library. Silence notifications on devices and avoid multitasking that splits your attention from the book. 
### Adjust Font Size and Lighting
Make sure text is **large and clear enough to read comfortably** without straining your eyes. Use proper lighting without too many bright sources that can cause eye fatigue or headaches. Take breaks to look into the distance and give your eyes a rest when needed.
### Have Snacks and Beverages Handy
Staying **hydrated and fueled helps you read for longer periods**. Keep a water bottle, cup of tea or coffee, and healthy snacks like fruit, nuts or yogurt within easy reach so you don't interrupt your flow. Nourish both your body and mind as you get lost in a great story.
## Squeeze in Reading Time Anywhere  
There's no need to clear large blocks of free time to enjoy reading. With a little creativity, you can incorporate pages into otherwise downtime moments throughout your day.
### Read While Exercising  
Audiobooks are perfect companions for **cardio workouts like walking, jogging, or using exercise equipment**. Having a fascinating story play keeps you motivated to keep moving and achieve your fitness goals. 
### Read During Commutes  
Whether you take public transportation or drive yourself, **carve out commute time for reading**. Keep an ebook, physical book, or audiobook handy for your journeys to and from work or activities. You'll feel like you're getting two tasks done at once.
### Read While You Eat  
Many of us mindlessly scroll social media or watch videos during meals, but you could be **squeezing in pages instead.** Unless you need to interact with others, have your reading material out at breakfast, lunch, or dinner for distraction-free reading time. 
### Read Before Bed 
Calming your mind with a chapter or short story before lights out is the perfect **wind-down activity to promote better sleep.** Make it part of your nightly routine by keeping a book on your bedside table to read in a cozy spot with low lighting.
## Improve Reading Speed and Comprehension
Being efficient with the time you do have for reading lets you experience even more stories. Try enhancing your reading skills.
### Use the PQ4R Method
This effective study technique boosts **comprehension by having you preview, question, read, reflect, recite, and review** each section. Skimming ahead and self-quizzing keeps you engaged versus passive reading alone. 
### Speed Read Strategically  
While not necessary for pleasure reading, **accelerating your pace with techniques like tracking, chunking, and transitional words** allows consuming more books. Make sure to still understand versus just blowing through pages aimlessly. 
### Recap Verbally or in Writing  
**Retelling or summarizing what you just read in your own words** , whether out loud to yourself or in writing, reinforces what you absorbed versus simply read. Great for checking comprehension before moving on to new sections.
### Test Yourself Periodically  
Inserting intermittent **self-quizzes by covering up text and trying to remember details** keeps your reading active versus passive. Check how well you recall characters, plot points, facts, and ideas without having to re-read large portions for clarification.
## Make Reading Social 
Sharing the books you discover and experiences with others brings an extra level of fun and engagement to your reading life. Consider these social aspects.
### Join a Book Club 
Whether virtually online or in-person at your local library or coffee shop, **book clubs motivate you to stay on a reading schedule with others.** Having set meeting dates to discuss deepens your understanding of stories. 
### Recommend Books to Friends and Family  
**Swapping book suggestions widens everyone's horizons.** Talking about what you're reading with loved ones who share the hobby inspires new additions to your personal TBR piles too. 
### Share Reviews Online  
**Writing reviews on sites like Goodreads and your preferred social networks** lets others benefit from your opinions on which stories are truly worth the investment of their time. Engage by commenting on other readers' updates too.
### Have Reading Dates  
**Schedule dedicated reading hangouts with buddies** where you each bring your current books but read independently yet enjoy one another's company. Afterwards, debrief over tea or coffee about your progress.
## Make Reading Rewarding
Giving yourself little perks tied to your reading accomplishments creates positive associations that motivate you to pick up more pages. 
### Get a Comfy Reading Spot
**Indulge your inner bookworm with cozy reading nooks,** whether a plush armchair with a throw, hanging daybed, or quiet reading nook complete with lighting and shelves. Seeing it ready for relaxing enjoyment inspires diving into stories there. 
### Treat Yourself after Finishing Books   
**Reward finishing novels by treating yourself to little luxuries** like a specialty coffee, movie rental, bookish gifts, manicure, or gourmet snack. As with exercise, small rewards reinforce the positive habit and keep you eager to tackle the next title on your list.
### Keep a Reading Journal  
**Documenting your reading progress, thoughts, and ratings engages you more deeply**. Look back on past entries for recommendations or to revisit clever quotes. Bonus points for including bookish artwork, mementos or pressing flowers from your backyard.
### Variety Keeps it Interesting
**Switching genres, formats and where you read prevents stagnation.** If nonfiction has you stuck, pick up a gripping novel. Try audiobooks on walks after eye strain from ebooks. Change up your usual reading chair for the park on weekends. Novelty sparks renewed enthusiasm.
Making reading an integral part of your self-care routine cultivates an active, imaginative mind, whether you dedicate 15 minutes or an hour each day. With organization, the ability to squeeze in pages anywhere, and motivating reading socially, you'll breeze through stacks of books all year long.
