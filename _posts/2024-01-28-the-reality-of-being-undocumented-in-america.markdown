### Living in Fear
As a first-generation immigrant from China, I have heard several stories from friends and acquaintances about people who "go dark" or stay hidden as undocumented immigrants in the United States. One story that I know to be true is about an elderly Chinese woman who overstayed her visa and became undocumented to stay with her family in America. 
The woman's son John and daughter-in-law Mary owned a small bakery business in their community. They also employed a few local workers. John's aging mother lived with them as she had no other children in China and John did not want her to stay alone. She came to the US on a B1/B2 visitor visa but could not return due to long immigration backlogs. Facing the difficult choice between leaving the old woman alone overseas or having her stay undocumented with family, they chose the latter.
For [years](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-light-shiba-inu-dog-design-matching-christmas-pajama-2), the old lady lived in constant fear of being discovered by authorities. She rarely left the house alone out of fear of getting lost or detained. The entire family also lived extremely conservatively to avoid deportation. They paid taxes diligently, observed traffic laws religiously and kept a low profile in the community. The children were warned not to misbehave at school or draw unnecessary attention. It was a difficult and stressful way to live for so long with the threat of potential separation through deportation.

### Struggles of Being Undocumented
Living as an undocumented immigrant exacted both physical and mental hardships on the elderly woman and her family. Grandma's health issues went untreated for fear of interactions with authorities or lack of affordability without medicaid coverage. Even minor illnesses were dealt with at home through over-the-counter medications instead of a doctor's visit. 
The constant worry and uncertainty took a significant psychological toll as well. Grandma later described her years spent hiding at home as being "imprisoned in her own house". She missed participating in family events and school activities freely due to the risks involved. Both John and Mary had to work long hours 6 days a week while alternating days off just to make ends meet financially without vacations or breaks for over a decade.
### Contributions of Undocumented Immigrants 
Despite facing legal restrictions and personal struggles, undocumented immigrants like Grandma have contributed substantially to American society through various means. As a homemaker, she provided invaluable childcare assistance so John and Mary could invest more productive hours into growing their small bakery business. Her efforts supported the success and expansion of a local enterprise employing fellow residents in the community.
Furthermore, studies have shown undocumented immigrants fill important labor gaps and help sustain entire industries that Americans are usually unwilling to work in. If forced to suddenly leave, the agricultural and construction sectors would face immense difficulties as seen recently after anti-immigration laws in some states like **Florida**. Vegetables would rot unpicked in fields while new housing development projects slowed down significantly due to worker shortages. 
Contrary to common misconceptions, undocumented immigrants also pay various taxes that fund public services through indirect means like sales taxes on purchases. Their social security numbers if obtained through fraudulent documentation are used to pay billions annually into the system that they have no access to benefits from. They rarely overburden social programs due to their reluctant and concealed nature living below the radar as much as possible.
### Green Card Approval and Eventual Citizenship
After living in the shadows for years, Grandma finally became eligible to file for a family visa through John's sponsorship. With the disclosure and recommendation of an immigration attorney well-versed in such affairs, she was granted legal permanent residency. Her model behavior as well as that of her family who avoided any criminal issues or interactions with authorities seemed to have benefited their case.
Eventually, Grandma gained the life-changing opportunity to officially become a naturalized American citizen through passing her citizenship exam with the help of a Mandarin translator. She could freely visit friends and family back in China without worries over admissibility upon return. Most importantly, Grandma no longer had to restrict herself to the confines of her home and lived freely participating in daily activities just like any other member of the community. 
Looking back, she described the relentless uncertainty and confinement of her prior undocumented existence as being equivalent to a prison sentence served right within the walls of her family's home. Like many others in her position, Grandma had no ill-intent but was simply a loving mother and grandmother trying her best to stay close with loved ones despite legal barriers.
### Effects of Anti-Immigration Policies  
Strict enforcement against undocumented immigrants often does more harm than good for society on multiple levels. Recently in Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis signed into law tougher measures like mandatory E-Verify check requirements for larger businesses. However, this immediately led to visible impacts counterproductive to the state's interests.
A now-viral video clearly showed a nearly abandoned construction site that typically would be bustling with activity on a weekday morning. The sole worker present lamented how projects were stalling due to sudden labour shortage consequences of the new policy discouraging immigrant participation. Farmers in the state also complained of rotting crops left unharvested in fields previously reliant on immigrant labor that has since dispersed.
While legal residents and authorities aim to deter undocumented entry and residence, severe crackdowns rarely solve underlying root issues practically. Many immigrants are hardworking contributors whom native populations have grown substantially reliant on. Rather than alienating them through hostility, more pragmatic compassionate compromises considering all stakeholder needs would better serve everyone's longterm interests. Proposals granting interim legal status or streamlined paths to citizenship for those already deeply ingrained deserve reasonable discussion.
### Looking for Reasonable Solutions
There are understandable perspectives on both sides of the complicated immigration debate that merit consideration towards balanced solutions. On one hand, a country does have the right to control and enforce its lawful borders which critics of open-border policies recognize. However, others argue for more pragmatic flexibility given America's history of welcoming immigrants and the intertwined roles they play across diverse communities nationwide today.
With years of staunch adherence, the Chinese grandmother's story highlights both challenges undocumented immigrants face but also their valuable community-level impacts worth retaining. While outright amnesty may concern restrictionists, expanding existing legal immigration quotas and instituting **merit-based criteria** recognizing length of residence, work history, education etc. could help regularize law-abiding situations over time. 
Reasonable people of good faith across the political spectrum seek reasonable, equitable and economically-sensible solutions. A balanced approach protects national security and cultural cohesion while also recognizing our shared humanity beyond borders. There may be no single answer, but open and respectful discussion informed by compassion rather than fear seems the best way forward.
