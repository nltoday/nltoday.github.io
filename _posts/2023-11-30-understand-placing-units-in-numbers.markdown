Numbers are made up of various units that are placed in different positions based on their value. Let us understand how we can arrange numbers from their word descriptions through placement of each unit in its proper location. 
The standard way of writing numbers in the Indian system uses lakhs, thousands, hundreds and ones as the main quantifying units. Each unit has a place value that is determined by its position from the right side. The ones/units place has the lowest value while moving left, the value keeps increasing exponentially.

In the given examples, 'one lakh three thousand eight hundred and fifty four' is the number in words. Here, 'one' refers to the quantity of 'lakh' units. Since a lakh equals 100,000, one lakh would mean 100,000. Moving to the left, 'three' tells us the quantity of 'thousand' units, which is 3,000. 'Eight' indicates the hundreds place with a value of 800. 'Fifty' shows the tens place with 50. And lastly, 'four' is in the ones place with a value of 4.

By placing each unit in its correct position based on increasing place values from right to left, we can write the number in digit format as 1,03,854. This allows us to understand the number thoroughly in terms of the quantifying units used and their locations. The process is similar for any numeric value described in words. Let us examine a few more examples.
### Arranging Other Numbers Based on Place Value
Take the number 'seventy-five thousand two hundred and sixty-one' described in words. Here, 'seventy-five' means the thousands place with a value of 75,000. 'Two' denotes the hundreds place which is 200. 'Sixty' locates the tens place of 600 while 'one' situates in the ones place of 1. In digit format, this number will be written as 75,261.

Similarly, for the number 'nine hundred eighty-seven' described verbally, 'nine' secures the hundreds place at 900. 'Eight' claims the tens position as 80 while 'seven' props up in the ones slot as 7. Its digital representation therefore emerges as 987.

These examples showcase how knowing the place value of each numerical unit allows switching between the word and digit modes effortlessly. The systematic arrangement from the highest to lowest place values unfolds the inner composition of any numeric quantity expressed verbally.

### Significance of Place Value System
The [indented place value framework](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/alegre) plays a pivotal role in learning mathematics. It provides kids an intuitive logic for comprehending large numbers, performing addition/subtraction/multiplication/division, and grasping fundamental algebraic concepts like powers/exponents.

Without a well-defined position for each digit, carrying out mathematical operations would be an arduous task. Place value streamlines the process with a consistent hierarchy. For instance, theregrouping involved in multi-digit addition/subtraction would be perplexing in other number forms. 
Mastering the **incrementing place value organization** also smoothens grasps of more complex notions later like integers, fractions, decimals, percentages etc. It prepares children with a foundational understanding to smoothly move to higher arithmetic and beyond. Teachers emphasize on this at the initial learning phase to sow the seeds of a holistic quantitative aptitude.

In summary, the sensible placement of digits accords numerals their true significance. Recognizing this graded sequence of values is pivotal to obtain clarity on numbers and skill in numeric manipulations. It builds the cornerstone for more sophisticated mathematical advances subsequently.
