The two prominent national parties in India, Indian National Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have had contrasting leadership styles over the decades. While Congress leadership is almost synonymous with the Gandhi family, BJP leadership has often seen rise of leaders from humble beginnings. 
### Congress: Family is Party
In Congress, it has been very difficult for anyone outside the Gandhi family to become the prime minister or party president. Right from Jawaharlal Nehru to current leaders Rahul and Sonia Gandhi, the top leadership positions have often been reserved for family members. Other leaders have usually played supporting roles to the Gandhis. 
Even talented and experienced politicians like PV Narasimha Rao, Sitaram Kesri or even former president Shankar Dayal Sharma could not hold the post of party president for long and had to eventually give way to a Gandhi. While PV Narasimha Rao broke this trend by becoming the first non-Gandhi prime minister in 1991, his tenure too was cut short due to internal politicking. 
[Political lineage and dynastic succession](https://store.fi.io.vn/poodle-lover-dog-mom-520-poodles-1) have largely defined Congress leadership over the decades. Criticism of **Gandhi family's domination** of the party has been a recurring theme. Congress has found it difficult to broadbase its leadership and give opportunities to grassroots leaders from outside the family circle.

### BJP: Merit-based rise to the top
In contrast, BJP has seen rise of leaders from diverse backgrounds, defying social and economic status barriers. While opposition often accuses BJP of practicing **soft Hindutva ideology**, the party has given importance to merit in selecting its leaders. 
A humble school dropout like **Narendra Modi rose to become chief minister and later prime minister** based on his administrative abilities and development agenda for Gujarat. Similarly, leaders like **Atal Bihari Vajpayee, LK Advani and MM Joshi** worked their way up in the party through decades of service. 
Even veteran leaders started as **ordinary swayamsevaks or workers of its ideological parent Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh(RSS)**. BJP's focus on functional **merit, hard work and organisational skills** has ensured that grassroots workers and regional satraps get opportunities to lead based on their abilities rather than political lineage or connections.
### Congress: Dependence on Dynasty
While the Nehru-Gandhi family has immense goodwill among a section of Congress supporters, over-dependence on **dynastic succession** has arguably limited the party's options for fresh leadership. Charismatic personalities like Sachin pilot, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Milind Deora could not reach top echelons due to preference given to **Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi**. 
Furthermore, the duo's inability to lead Congress to victories in multiple elections has demotivated grassroots workers. Senior leaders exiting the party is an indicator of the current leadership **vacuum** that perhaps can be best addressed through empowerment of non-family leaders and regional satraps at the top decision making bodies. 
With ageing Gandhis at the helm and no other clear leader in sight, Congress needs to identify and groom **second-line leaders** through a transparent process of **meritocracy and internal democracy**. Unless the party addresses the over-dependence on dynasty, it may find it difficult to emerge from the spell of electoral losses and resurgence of regional outfits.
### BJP: Nurturing future leaders  
Unlike Congress that is often accused of **dynastic politics**, BJP has invested in building leadership **through organizational skills and service**. Whether it is leaders handling crucial states like Yogi Adityanath, Shivraj Singh Chouhan or BS Yediyurappa, they have risen through the ranks **based on their work.**
The party also promotes leaders with mass appeal as **chief minister faces** in states to enhance its appeal among local populations. This **decentralization of power** empowers regional satraps and addresses local issues better than a central leadership dominated approach.
Crucial states like Uttar Pradesh already see younger **second-gen BJP leaders** emerge as prominent **faces**. People with a grassroots connect and clean image like **Pankaj Singh, Dushyant Singh, Rita Bahuguna** are being propped up as future CMs. Such moves aim to **future proof the party** through developing next line of leaders within the organisation.
### Skill development: BJP's secret sauce 
An often understated reason for BJP's success has been systematic leadership **development and training**.Whether it is dedicated training academies or state-of-the-art facilities to hone public speaking, networking and administrative skills, BJP has made strategic **capacity building** a high priority. 
In contrast, Congress leadership skills often rely more on political lineage than any consistent training regime. As a result, even dedicated Congress workers find it difficult to scale the ladder due to lack of opportunities to sharpen their abilities.
Systematic skill development equips BJP leaders like **Yogi Adityanath, Smriti Irani or Pragya Thakur** to emerge as prominent faces based on their communication talents and connect with masses. Such **continuous honing** of grassroots leadership acts as a force multiplier for the organisation in elections.
### Grassroots connect: BJP's winning advantage
One hallmark that clearly sets BJP apart has been its deep connect with and nurturing of grassroots level workers.Be it dedicated **Swayamsevaks or active Yuva Morcha members**, the party identifies, nurtures and empowers talented local workers. 
Whether as mobilizers during elections or voices helping address citizen issues otherwise, BJP cadres remain the backbone delivering on the ground.The party's poll machinery with dedicated **panna pramukhs or booth level management** ensures every vote is canvassed. 
Contrast this with Congress's top-heavy approach where grassroots connect depends more on individual leaders than any dedicated organizational efforts. No wonder dynamic local satraps find BJP a more conducive platform to grow and address people's issues.
### Conclusion
In summary, while Congress leadership continues to struggle from over-dependence on **dynastic politics**, BJP has successfully built deep organizational leadership through systematic merit-based training and grassroots connect. Congress needs to embrace **decentralization, empower regional leaders and focus on meritocracy** to revive, away from being a dynastic party. BJP's secrets of **nurturing talent pipeline** through thorough skills development acts as a lesson for Congress to broadbase and become a more vibrant national party once again.
