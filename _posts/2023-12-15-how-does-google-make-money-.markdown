### **Google's Advertising Business Model**
Google's parent company Alphabet relies heavily on advertising for revenue. In 2018, about 85% of Alphabet's total revenue came from advertising on Google properties like Search, YouTube, and the Google Display Network. This amounted to roughly $116 billion in advertising revenue. 
Google makes money from advertising through two main types - search ads and display ads. Search ads appear on Google Search results pages and are based on relevant keyword searches. Advertisers bid on keywords and pay Google when users click their ads. Display ads can appear across the Google Display Network on websites and apps. Google analyzes content and user interests to show relevant display ads.

### [Targeting the Right Users through Personalized Search](https://yt.io.vn/collection/adcox) 
To drive advertising revenue, Google needs high search volumes. It achieves this through building the most comprehensive search index and delivering highly personalized search results. By scanning websites constantly and understanding query context through previous searches and user profiles, Google can return the most relevant results in under a second for the vast majority of searches. 
This delivers immense value to users by saving them time spent searching elsewhere. As a result, millions of people use Google Search every day without directly paying. However, their usage data allows Google to better target ads and build rich user profiles that inform ad targeting and personalization. The more Google understands its users, the more valuable its advertising becomes.
### **The Power of Search Advertising for Businesses**
For businesses, Google search ads offer incredibly precise targeting of potential customers. Advertisers can bid on keyword phrases related to their products or services. When users search for those keywords, the business’ ad appears prominently in results. 
clicks could be worth just a few cents for less competitive terms but over $50 for phrases like "auto insurance". This pay-per-click model allows businesses to only pay when an ad results in action by being clicked. It also makes ads highly relevant to users actively searching solutions related to what a business offers. As a result, search ads tend to have high conversion rates for advertisers.
### **Expanding the Google Display Network**
Beyond search ads, Google also generates revenue through display advertising across its vast digital properties like YouTube, Gmail and Google Maps. It also works with third-party publisher partners who integrate Google AdSense scripts allowing them to earn revenue from ads on their websites and apps.
Google leverages its deep understanding of users to target these display ads with high relevance based on context and interests. Not only can it analyze what content a user is consuming, it can tie this to their overall search and browsing history. As a result, Google can achieve strong performance matching display ads to the right users at the right times to drive outcomes for advertisers.
### **Continued Innovation and Revenue Growth** 
Despite its enormous size and scale, Google has continued growing advertising revenue at impressive rates of around 20% annually. This shows the company's ability to keep improving ad targeting and relevancy while expanding into new formats and devices. Google is also diversifying revenue beyond ads by investing heavily in other priority areas like Cloud computing and hardware.
Projects under other bets like Google Cloud and Google Play generated $20.5 billion in revenue for Alphabet in 2018, up from just $3.2 billion in 2009. These amounts remain small fractions of total sales but represent important long-term bets. If they pay off, they could further diversify Alphabet's revenue streams and business model in the decades ahead.
### **An Ecosystem Approach to Driving Value**
Ultimately, Google's success relies on continued growth of its user base, the time they spend engaged, and the data it can collect. By offering helpful services, continuously improving user experience and expanding its ecosystem of connected platforms, Google aims to solidify its position as a ubiquitous part of global digital lives and commerce. 
This approach creates a powerful flywheel that drives more usage, data, ad revenue, reinvestment and innovation. The more people integrate Google into their daily activities, the more opportunities advertisers have to connect with ready audiences. At the same time, users benefit from helpful, personalized services without directly paying for them. This balanced ecosystem approach underpins Google’s massive and ongoing financial success.
So in summary, Google makes the vast majority of its money from online advertising by leveraging its dominance of internet search and ability to precisely target users based on their interests and past behaviors. Its strengths lie in building useful, engaging products and constantly innovating to sustain growth across new formats and markets worldwide.
