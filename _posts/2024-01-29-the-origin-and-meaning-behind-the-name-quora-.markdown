### Enlightening Group Discussions
Quora is a question and answer website founded in 2009 by former Facebook employees Adam D'Angelo and Charlie Cheever. The site aims to foster insightful discussions around various topics through a community platform where users can pose questions and provide thoughtful answers. 
As the site grew in popularity as a place for [knowledge sharing and crowdsourced wisdom](https://yt.io.vn/collection/acklin), many wondered about the origin and intent behind its unique name. Some speculated it was a play on "question" given the Q, while others thought it referenced the group discussions and consensus building that occurs. However, the true meaning is rooted in the concept of a quorum.

### A Quorum Indicates Consensus  
A quorum refers to the minimum number of members of an assembly or society that must be present at any of its meetings to make the proceedings of that meeting valid. The basic idea is that a quorum ensures that important decisions are not made by just a small subset of members. There needs to be a critical mass of representatives for any vote or resolution to carry legitimacy.
Cheever, one of Quora's founders, revealed that they chose the name partly because a quorum speaks to the idea of people coming together and reaching agreement through discussion. The goal of the site was to facilitate **knowledge-sharing communities** where insights could emerge from the collaborative exchange of many perspectives.
### "Quora" Honors the Latin Roots
While "quorum" itself is already a plural form, some mistakenly thought adding an "a" made it a faux-Latin plural. However, Cheever corrected this notion, stating that "quorum" derives from Latin and is grammatically correct as is. 
The founders still opted for "Quora" because it **aligned with their vision of an online forum** that mirrors the consensus-building spirit of what a quorum represents in the real world. It also had a pleasing phonicquality when paired with their pursuit of building lively dialogues, as in "flora" relating to growth.
### Finding the Right Domain Fit the Name
In their interview with VentureBeat, Cheever further noted that "Quora" was the only domain name option where the owner was actually willing to sell them the rights. Serendipitously, it felt like **the perfect match** for their innovative question-centered social network aiming to cultivate engaged communities.
While some skepticism remains around creating Latin-inspired pluralizations, the name "Quora" has stuck as the site has expanded globally. Most now understand its deeper meaning rooted in democratic discussion and collective wisdom - key aspects of its purpose and design.
### Constructive Conversations Still the Focus 
Over a decade since launch, Quora continues prioritizing civil, good-faith exchanges between its millions of members. While growth and new features have evolved the platform considerably, at its core is still facilitating **insightful multi-sided debates.**
The founders chose a name symbolizing how consensus forms when diverse viewpoints come together respectfully. As divisive as online discourse has become, Quora remains dedicated to this same spirit of inquisitive and nuanced discussions it set out to enable all those years ago.
