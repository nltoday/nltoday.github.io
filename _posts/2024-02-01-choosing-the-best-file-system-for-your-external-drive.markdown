### Formatting Options for External Drives
When formatting an external drive to use with Mac, there are a few important file system options to consider. The main choices are **APFS (Apple File System), HFS+ (Mac OS Extended - Journaled), and FAT/ExFAT**. Each has its own advantages and limitations. **Solid state drives (SSDs)[ will generally benefit from using ](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/french-bulldog)APFS for its advanced storage management and space optimization features**. **Hard disk drives (HDDs)** are still better suited for **HFS+ which provides compatibility while maintaining journaling for crash protection**. **FAT/ExFAT** is only recommended if you need **cross-compatibility with Windows and other devices without Mac support**.

### APFS for SSD Performance and Features
As the default filesystem for newer Mac models, **APFS (Apple File System)** brings several advanced storage technologies. On **SSDs in particular, it can take advantage of space sharing, cloning, andsnapshots to optimize capacity**. By storing only changed data rather than complete copies, **APFS SSDs see much faster read/write speeds compared to HFS+**. It also supports important SSD features like **TRIM commands** for garbage collection. For performance and longevity on **USB 3.1 or Thunderbolt 3 SSDs meant for frequent use on Mac**, choosing **APFS offers clear benefits over older filesystems**.
### HFS+ is Still Suitable for Most HDDs 
While **APFS brings clear gains on SSDs, HFS+ remains a good choice for standard HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) in most cases**. As a more mature filesystem, **HFS+ provides very stable operation and compatibility across Mac versions dating back years**. The inclusion of **journaling also protects against data corruption from unexpected ejections or system crashes** common with portable HDDs. Most **data recovery utilities also still support HFS+ better than the newer APFS standard as well**. Unless you have an **HDD specifically meant for very high performance workloads**, **HFS+ journaled formatting strikes a good balance even on USB 3.x HDDs**.
### FAT/ExFAT for Multi-Platform Compatibility 
In situations where you need your external drive to work seamlessly across both Mac and Windows environments without any extra software, **FAT or ExFAT are the only options that provide this level of cross-compatibility out of the box**. **FAT was the longtime standard but has limitations with file sizes over 4GB**, making **ExFAT preferable in many cases today**. The downside is that neither filesystem supports advanced features like **journaling** and both **have worse performance compared to HFS+ and APFS**. So **FAT/ExFAT is best reserved only when multi-OS support is a strict necessity**.
### Formatting your External Drive in Disk Utility
Now that the main filesystem choices are clear, you can format your external drive accordingly using macOS's built-in Disk Utility app. Here are the basic steps:
1. Launch Disk Utility from Spotlight, Launchpad, or Applications > Utilities folders. 
2. Select the drive you want to format from the sidebar. 
3. Click the "Erase" button and choose a format like "APFS", "Mac OS Extended (Journaled)", or "ExFAT" based on your earlier considerations. 
4. Give the drive a name and click "Erase" to begin the formatting process. 
5. Once complete, eject the drive properly before disconnecting to avoid issues.
Be sure to back up any important data beforehand as formatting erases the drive completely. Follow these guidelines to pick the best filesystem for optimum performance and compatibility with your external storage needs on Mac.
### Considerations for Drive Longevity
In addition to choosing the right file format, there are a few other factors to consider for maximizing the lifespan of an external drive:
- **Proper handling and storage** - Avoid excessive shaking, drops or pressure when the drive is powered on. Store securely when not in use.
- **Cool and ventilated location** - Drives tend to last longer when kept in open areas away from direct heat sources like radiators or sunshine through windows. 
- **Avoid overfilling drives** - Leaving at least 10-20% free capacity helps prevent hardware strains from storage being too fragmented. 
- **Periodic disk checks and repairs** - Use Disk Utility regularly to scan and fix any minor issues before they worsen. Check S.M.A.R.T status as well for HDDs.
- **Reformat every 1-2 years** - This wipes old cached files and helps clear fragmentations, ensuring faster operation like when the drive was new. 
By choosing the right filesystem and maintaining some best practices, external drives can remain dependable high-capacity companions for years of portable Mac storage needs.
### Backup is Crucial
Without a proper backup strategy, even the most carefully chosen and maintained external drive carries risks of data loss from failure or corruption. To keep important documents, photos, projects and more fully protected requires:
- **Maintain at least one backup copy on a separate storage device.** Ideally should be stored separately from your main locations, like in a different physical location entirely. 
- **For critical data, employ the 3-2-1 backup rule** - 3 total copies, 2 local but 1 offsite for disaster recovery purposes. Cloud backups fit this well for their automatic synchronized offsite nature.
- **Test restores from backups periodically** - Verify your backup solutions work as intended and you can successfully retrieve past file versions if needed.
- **Automate backups whenever possible** - Many external drives and cloud services offer setups to constantly or regularly backup changed files in an hands-free manner. 
With proper external drive filesystem preparation and a sound backup strategy, you can enjoy all the portable access and extended capacity benefits external storage provides while safeguarding your most important digital assets.
