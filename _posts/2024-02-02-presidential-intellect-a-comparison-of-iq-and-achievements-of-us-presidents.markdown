### A Legacy of Success 
Barack Obama was one of the most accomplished presidents in modern history. He received his law degree from Harvard Law School, graduating magna cum laude and serving as the president of the Harvard Law Review, [considered one of the most prestigious positions a law student can hold](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/akridge). Experts have estimated his IQ to be around 120-130, well above average.

### An Academic and Political Career
Obama went on to have an illustrious teaching career at the University of Chicago Law School before entering politics. He was elected to the Illinois State Senate in 1996 and later to the United States Senate in 2004. As the first African American president, Obama overcame racial barriers and tremendous adversity to achieve the highest office in the nation through his intellect and leadership abilities. 
### A Stellar Mind
Bill Clinton is widely considered one of the most intelligent US presidents, with an estimated IQ of 150, in the range of genius. He was a **Rhodes scholar**, earning a degree from Georgetown University and a law degree from Yale Law School. Clinton demonstrated exceptional abilities throughout his political career and two terms as president. 
### Academic Success and Public Service
Another president noted for his academic achievements was Jimmy Carter. He earned a bachelor's degree from the United States Naval Academy in 1946 with a focus on nuclear physics. Carter went on to serve as a state senator and governor of Georgia before becoming the 39th US president. His intelligence and commitment to public service were evident throughout his career.
### An Esteemed Educator  
George W. Bush graduated from Yale University and Harvard Business School, demonstrating above-average intellect with an estimated IQ around 110-120. He began his career as an oil businessman in Texas. Later, Bush served as a two-term governor and then president. Prior to his political career, he was also a **professor of business administration** at the University of Texas.
### Questionable Intellectual Capacity
In stark contrast to his predecessors, Donald Trump's intellectual abilities and academic achievements pale in comparison. Experts assess his IQ to be a mere 87, well below average intelligence. Trump displayed little intellectual curiosity and faced setbacks in business before entering politics. As president, he struggled with basic governance and global issues. His failure to uphold presidential norms and standards raised serious concerns about his mental capacities.
### A Champion of Progressive Policies  
During his presidency, Barack Obama championed many progressive policies and initiatives. Through the Affordable Care Act, he expanded health insurance coverage to millions of Americans. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 jumpstarted the economy following the Great Recession. Obama also took steps to curb climate change and advance environmental protections. His leadership, vision, and intellectual heft were instrumental in passing landmark legislation.
### Stewardship in Challenging Times   
The COVID-19 pandemic exposed major deficiencies in leadership at the federal level under Donald Trump. Consistent failures to follow public health guidance and provide a coherent national strategy only prolonged the health crisis and economic downturn. Mismanagement was compounded by the president's lack of intellectual prowess and inability to coordinate an effective whole-of-government response. The nation suffered terribly due to deficiencies in basic competence and stewardship from its top elected official.
