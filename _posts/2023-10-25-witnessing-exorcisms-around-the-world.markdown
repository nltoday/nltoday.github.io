### My First Encounter with the Paranormal
When I was younger, I was very curious about the paranormal and would often play ghost summoning games like Charlie Charlie with my friends. One night, after playing the game, I felt something grab my shoulder tightly. For days afterwards, my shoulder was red and painful. I would also often hear screams and feel like something was watching me, though nothing else ever happened. While my friends thought I was just imagining things, the experiences left me feeling unsettled.

### A [Possession Exorcism](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/agostini) on the Beach
A few years later, while hanging out with friends at the beach late one Thursday night, we witnessed something truly bizarre. One of my Malay friends, who happened to be on her period, suddenly screamed for no reason and collapsed on the ground. When people tried to help her up, she struggled violently while **mumbling incoherently**. It took several strong men to restrain her as she seemed to have **superhuman strength**. Only when an older Malay man started chanting verses from the Quran did she suddenly calm down and pass out. According to friends, she had been **possessed by an evil spirit**. 
### Strange Beliefs about Days and Women's Cycles
After this event, I learned that some Malay people believe Thursdays carry a higher risk of **ghostly hauntings and possessions**. Additionally, women on their periods should avoid going out late at night due to beliefs about **spirits preying on women at such times**. While I'm skeptical of such beliefs, that night on the beach certainly left me puzzled and wondering if there may be truth underlying these cultural traditions.
### A Pentecostal Exorcism in America 
Years later, while living in America, I was invited by a friend to attend a Pentecostal church service. During the energetic worship portion, an elderly woman started **flailing violently** and **screaming** at the front of the congregation. The pastor and several helpers rushed over to restrain her gently. He then firmly spoke to the **afflicting spirit**, commanding it to leave in the name of Jesus. Within moments, the woman collapsed peacefully with a look of relief. The pastor later said she had been **demon-possessed for decades** but found freedom that day. 
### The Power of Faith and Prayer
Watching different types of **"spirit releasement"** rituals over the years has given me a new perspective on spiritual battles. While skepticism still remains, I can't deny the **transformative power of faith and prayer** that seems to aid victims. Whether through chanting scripture, energetic worship, or simply holiness and prayer - there appears to be something beyond medical explanations at work. Though I don't fully understand it, these experiences have left me more open-minded towards the possibility of **real spiritual forces** at play in this world.
### A Catholic Exorcism in Rome
My most recent encounter with exorcism was in Rome, the heart of Catholicism. While touring St. Peter's Basilica, I noticed pamphlets advertising a live exorcism happening that evening at a small church. Out of curiosity, I decided to attend. The service involved intense prayer, **quoting scripture** verbatim, **holy water sprinklings**, and moments where the priest would sternly command demons by name to depart. A young woman writhing on the floor appeared to go through intense agony before finally collapsing in relief. Witnessing the elaborate Catholic ritual firsthand was both unsettling yet fascinating. It left me questioning whether some afflictions genuinely stem from **evil spiritual oppression**, at least from the perspective of sincere devotees.
### Lingering Questions About the Spirit Realm 
While experiences witnessing different exorcisms around the world have left me more open-minded towards some notions of spirituality, I still have many questions. Are these events rooted purely in **faith**, or is there truly interaction with a **parallel spirit realm**? Could explanations also involve mental illness in some cases? Regardless of beliefs, it seems humility is wise given the profound mysteries of life, death and what lies beyond our physical senses. For now, these encounters continue to leave me wondering about realities beyond what science has defined.
