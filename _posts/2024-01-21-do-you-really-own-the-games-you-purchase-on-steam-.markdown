### What Happens if Steam Goes Away? 
With over 30 million active users logging into Steam every month, millions of customers have invested thousands of dollars purchasing digital games on the Steam platform over the past two decades. However, an often overlooked question remains - what would happen to all those games if Steam servers were to shut down or the company goes bankrupt? Losing access to potentially hundreds of games in one's Steam library would be a nightmare scenario for many players. 
While Steam has become the most popular digital PC games storefront, the terms of service clearly state that customers are merely purchasing a license to access and play games, not outright ownership. This poses risks if the platform disappears, since those licenses would no longer be validated without the Steam authentication servers. Some solutions may lie in laws changing to recognize digital license transfers, or services ensuring backup access outside of any singular company's control.

### [Steam License vs True Ownership of Games](https://store.fi.io.vn/mommysaurus-mom-mom-2-kids3091-t-shirt)
When purchasing games on Steam, customers are agreeing to Steam's Subscriber Agreement which stipulates that one is buying an indefinite license to access and play games, rather than gaining full ownership of the product. This is different than physically owning a disc or download code for a game. Discs can be kept, installed without internet authentication, and played anytime at the user's discretion rather than relying on a third party platform remaining functional. 
Though Steam's framework provides convenience through automatic updates and unified game libraries, it comes at the cost of having the ultimate control rest with Valve rather than the paying customer. Game licenses on Steam can even be revoked by publishers at will. Regardless of the large libraries built up over years, customers would have no recourse if the service suddenly shuttered without provisions made to transfer their licenses elsewhere. True ownership offers ongoing access with fewer variables that could intervene.
### **What Happens if Game Publishers Leave Steam?** 
Another complication that arises with relying so heavily on Steam's marketplace is the potential for publishers to pull their games from the platform. If an indie studio or major developer chooses to migrate its catalog elsewhere, those titles can disappear overnight from Steam users' libraries since they never actually owned the rights. 
This happened in 2019 when Metro Exodus was suddenly made an Epic Games Store exclusive. Those who pre-ordered on Steam found their pre-orders canceled with the game unplayable until transferring stores or waiting a full year. While smaller in scope, it highlighted the imbalance of power between users, Valve, and third-party developers within this ecosystem. Relying on continued cooperation introduces uncertainty where ownership provides reassurance.
### **Potential Solutions to the Risks of Digital License Ownership**
One possible solution gaining traction would be implementing laws recognizing the transferability of digital licenses between services or users. Much like re-selling physical copies of games and software, being able to move a valid license from one marketplace to another could help avoid getting locked into any single storefront's fate. It would empower consumers while also allowing competition between services.
Alternatively, studios publishing on Steam could implement "DRM-free" releases for purchase which don't require Steam authentication. Customers would truly own stand-alone copies able to be backed up and played without internet dependency. Services like GOG have championed this model to customer acclaim, balancing convenience with empowering ownership. 
Providing options for migrating one's digital library to personal external backups could also help safeguard long-term access should a platform shut down. As with music or video collections, being able to maintain libraries independently offers future-proofing against marketplace volatility or failure. Technology already exists for this, but support would need to come from the top down.
### **The Convenience/Control Balancing Act** 
For many gamers, the convenience of services like Steam has been a fair trade-off compared to dealing with physical media, individual game launchers, and software management hassles of years past. Not having to juggle game installers and updates across dozens of titles is a huge advantage and why Steam's platform has endured. 
However, the threat of a hypothetical "Steam doomsday" scenario where all that convenience suddenly vanishes also can't be ignored. Finding a balanced approach that maintains ease-of-use while shifting more actual ownership to customers could help establish trust for both present and future generations of PC gamers. With careful stewardship, digital distribution need not come at the expense of long-term control over the fruits of one's purchases.
### **Incremental Steps Towards Improved Digital Ownership**
Rather than sweeping regulatory overhauls, constructive change may happen gradually through balanced, consumer-oriented policies. Steam and other marketplaces supporting basic transferability of licenses between authorized services could alleviate lock-in fears, as could expanded DRM-free purchase options. 
Providing official means of backing up purchased libraries through quarterly download packages sent to customers, external hard drives replenished each major update, or cloud storage linked to personal accounts offers a middle-ground preserving past investments even if platforms change. Starting discussion and testing innovative solutions now safeguards future enjoyment of decades of digital collections. 
Incremental steps can inform future legislation with real-world data on balancing corporate, consumer and creator interests fairly. Though digital distribution differs inherently from physical, with informed compromise its benefits need not preclude treating customers as true owners investing in long-term platforms. Progress happens through open-minded cooperation, not contradiction.
