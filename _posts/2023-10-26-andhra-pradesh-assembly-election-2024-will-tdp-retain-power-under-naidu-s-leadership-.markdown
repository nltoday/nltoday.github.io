### The Current Scenario 
The last assembly election in Andhra Pradesh saw YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) led by Jaganmohan Reddy sweep to power ending the reign of Telugu Desam Party (TDP) under Chandrababu Naidu which lasted for over 14 years. In the initial years, Chief Minister Jagan Reddy announced and implemented many [welfare schemes](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-duck-gift-for-mom-mother-duckling-duck-waterfowl-lovers-v-neck-t-shirt/men&) like 'Amma Vodi', 'Vasati Deevena' scheme to provide financial assistance for housing to women, subsidy for crop loans and formed 'Village/Ward Secretariats' for better governance. However, over time the **rising debt burden**, increasing fiscal deficit, lack of new **industrial development** have become major concerns.

### TDP's Strategies to Regain Power
TDP under Naidu's experienced leadership will focus on highlighting the failures and unfulfilled promises of the current regime. Naidu who has proven track record of **good governance** and overseeing infrastructure/industrial growth as former CM will cite examples to convince voters why only TDP can ensure **sustainable development** of the state. TDP is preparing to launch an aggressive social media campaign featuring Naidu's vision and specific plans/policies for different sectors if voted to power again. TDP will also try to form pre-poll alliances with like-minded regional parties to **strengthen its electoral position**.
### YSRCP's Plans to Retain Power
Chief Minister Jaganmohan Reddy will bank on the popularity of the various **populist welfare schemes** his government rolled out and claim that more time is needed for their larger benefits to accrue. YSRCP is also exploring possibilities of pre-poll tie-ups with national parties like BJP, TRS to gain their **vote banks and funding support**. Just before polls, YSRCP may announce few more sops especially targeting key voter demographics. Jagan will also likely blame the COVID-19 pandemic and past TDP government for the present debt and fiscal issues to shift blame. 
### Role of National Parties 
Both BJP and Congress have marginal presence in Andhra Pradesh now. BJP may support YSRCP covertly while maintaining equidistance from both major regional parties to have a say in event of a hung assembly. Congress is not a major force but has some traditional vote shares. It will be interesting to see if Congress and JanaSena Plus come together under Pawan Kalyan’s leadership to emerge as the main opposition bloc. Their pre-poll alliance/understanding can damage either TDP or YSRCP’s prospects.
### Caste & Religion Equations
Caste equations play an important role in elections in Andhra Pradesh. Reddy community, Kammas, Kapus, Kshatriyas form some of the dominant castes. YSRCP has secured support of Reddys while TDP enjoys backing from other castes. Religious factors like perceptions around TDP/BJP’s pro-Hindu image versus YSRCP’s secular credentials may also tilt the caste arithmetic to some extent. TDP will need support from majority of non-Reddy castes to overcome this disadvantage.
### Economic Indicators & Anti-Incumbency 
The performance of Jagan Reddy government on reviving state’s economic growth, improving human development metrics, controlling rising debt and curbing corruption will be crucial. High unemployment, farm distress due to falling incomes and rise in cost of living has created dissatisfaction among masses. Persistent power cuts and poor infrastructure in some regions can generate **anti-incumbency** against YSRCP. TDP will make this their central poll plank to regain the confidence of voters.
### Final Assessment
Considering Naidu's experience, TDP's widespread organisational strength and the potential anti-incumbency against YSRCP government, TDP has an edge but result can go either way. Much will depend on pre-poll tie-ups, impact of caste & religious equations on voting patterns, and which party is perceived as a stronger alternative by 2024 to handle state's economic challenges. Effective communication of their agenda to citizens along with a well-oiled campaign machinery will help TDP/YSRCP sway the mandate in their favour. It promises to be a very closely fought election.
