### Ensuring Accurate Account Details
When trying to make changes to your Employee Provident Fund (EPF) account [online pension options](https://store.fi.io.vn/funny-chihuahuas-easter-day-bunny-eggs-easter-costume-womens-chihuahua-dog), one common error members encounter is "No details found against UAN". **This generally occurs** due to incorrect or outdated details linked to the Universal Account Number (UAN). **It is crucial to first validate all account information** is accurate before attempting any transactions through the EPFO (Employee Provident Fund Organization) member portal. 
Members should **double check the UAN** entered matches what is printed on their salary slips. **The UAN is a 12-digit number** issued by the EPFO to consolidate multiple PF accounts into one. **Verifying the correct UAN** is entered helps eliminate errors resulting from typos or entering the wrong account ID. Member's should also validate their **Know Your Customer (KYC)** details like Aadhaar number, PAN, and bank account are correctly linked to the UAN. **Outdated KYC information** can impede portal access or limit services.
