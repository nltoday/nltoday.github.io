Steam and other platforms have no way of knowing if you're playing a cracked game unless it has their anti-cheat software installed. Here is a deeper look into playing pirated games and the safety concerns around it.
### Cracked Games Will Not Be Detected  
Steam and other platforms can only see the games associated with your account. A cracked game would not be in your library, so [there is no way for them to detect the unauthorized copy](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-crazy-havanese-lady-dog-lover-v-neck-t-shirt/men&). The only exception is if the game uses Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) or similar software, as that may flag the modified files. However, Steam itself does not monitor what programs you run outside of their platform.

### Pirates Aim to Build Reputation, Not Damage Computers
Game crackers, also called "scene groups", have strong motivations **not to compromise people's cybersecurity** when releasing their work. Damaging computers would destroy the goodwill and reputation they work to establish within piracy circles. Their goal is widespread distribution and recognition for their skills, which relying on malware could easily undermine. Additionally, most individual pirates simply want to play games affordably and have little incentive to potentially harm others.
### Modern Malware Targets More Lucrative Victims 
In the age of identity theft, average computer users are not a high-value target for criminals. People engaging in piracy are assumed to have less disposable income anyway. Instead, modern malware authors look for paths into corporate networks or target specific groups with valuable private info. Relying on tampered game files is an inefficient infection method compared to operating system vulnerabilities or phishing scams. The risk of encountering malware from pirated games remains exceptionally low.
### Past Concerns Were Overblown
In the 1990s, before widespread internet connectivity, some programmers may have included basic malware in cracked software for notoriety. However, this was never a major threat and became obsolete as personal computers networked globally. Today's sophisticated cyberattacks focus on financial gain, not juvenile stunts. While no digital activity can be 100% guaranteed safe, fears over rampant piracy malware were always disproportionate to actual documented cases of harm.
### Verify File Sources and Use Common Sense 
As with any downloads, users should take basic precautions like only getting pirated files from trusted sources with a history of safe releases. Avoid shady websites with excessive advertising or newcomers without a proven track record. Also, pay attention to your computer for unusual programs running in the background or changes in startup items and browser settings. With some basic cyber hygiene, most people can play pirated games safely without serious dangers of malware infection.
### Overall Low Risk When Careful
In summary, fears over pirated games being riddled with viruses were always overblown. Reputable scene groups and individuals cracking AAA titles have strong motivations to avoid reputation-damaging malware in their work. While no digital activity is without risk, savvy computer users practicing cautions like verifying sources can play pirated games with an exceptionally low probability of encountering anything malicious. Modern cybercrime simply targets more profitable victims than the average PC gamer.
### Alternatives for Those Wary of Piracy 
Those still hesitant about piracy have affordable legitimate options. Many PC game stores hold periodic deep discounts and free-to-play titles are abundant. Subscriptions services like Xbox Game Pass provide constant access for a low monthly fee. Also, certain less-popular older games can often be purchased for just a few dollars during sales. With patience and bargain hunting, dedicated gamers need not feel forced into unauthorized downloads to enjoy their hobby affordably.
