Getting ink stains out can test even the most seasoned stain fighters.

She started with alcohol, which only served to scatter the ink further. Next came tried-and-true stalwarts like Shout, lemon juice, vinegar and acetone - all to no avail. In a last-ditch effort, she even resorted to soaking the stain in human urine and tears of frustration. Finally, she landed on the winning combination. She made a paste by mixing Ajax cleanser with a small amount of water and let it soak overnight. The next day, she followed up with an **Oxy-Clean powder paste**, leaving it to work its magic.
