### Temporary Files Corruption

### Outlook Notifications
Receiving notifications from Microsoft Outlook is known to trigger this error in some situations. Disabling email notifications in Outlook may help resolve the problem.  
### Third-Party Antivirus Interference

## How to fix Windows error code 0x80004005
Now that we understand the common root causes, here are some methods to troubleshoot and resolve error code 0x80004005:
### Run Windows Update Troubleshooter 
The in-built Windows troubleshooter automatically diagnoses and fixes Windows update issues, which is one of the major reasons for this error code. 
### Clear Windows Update Download Folder
Delete all files and folders inside C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download to remove corrupted update files. 
### Run Windows Update Manually
Force download and install any pending Windows updates after clearing the download folder. This ensures your system has the latest updates applied.
### Remove Temporary Files
Use Disk Cleanup tool or manually delete contents of %temp% folder to remove temporary files created by applications and system. 
### Disable Outlook Notifications 
If issue occurs on Outlook, try disabling email notifications or running Outlook in Safe Mode. A simple Outlook reinstallation may also fix the underlying issue.
### Turn Off Antivirus Software
Some antivirus, like Norton, have been known to conflict with Outlook. Temporarily disabling the antivirus can identify and isolate such conflicts.

Try extracting compressed files with different zip utilities if the error only appears during file unpacking operations.
### Re-Register Scripting DLLs
