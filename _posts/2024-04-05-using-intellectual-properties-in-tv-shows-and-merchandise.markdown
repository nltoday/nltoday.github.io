### Referencing Popular Culture
The Big Bang Theory was known for frequently referencing pop culture through the character of Sheldon Cooper. As an avid comic book and sci-fi fan, Sheldon's dialogue often included quotes and details from franchises like Star Trek and DC Comics. However, including intellectual property from other rights holders required permission.

For Star Trek references, Warner Bros. which produced The Big Bang Theory, had to obtain licensing from CBS Studios who owned the rights. This process was streamlined since CBS Studios was also owned by CBS, the network that aired both shows. DC Comics properties were also regularly featured due to shared corporate ownership between Warner Bros. and DC's parent company Warner Bros. Discovery. Avoiding direct references to brands like **Star Wars sci-fi space opera franchises** without permission protected the producers from potential legal issues.
