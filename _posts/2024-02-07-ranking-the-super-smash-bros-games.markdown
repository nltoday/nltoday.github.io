Each game has brought something new and exciting to the table while also refining mechanics from previous entries. However, not every Smash game is created equal.

### The King of Competitive Play - Melee
Released in 2001 for the Nintendo GameCube, **Super Smash Bros. Melee** remains the gold standard for competitive Smash over 20 years later. Its lightning fast gameplay and [deep system mechanics](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/albury) have given rise to a thriving esports scene. Melee features the snappiest controls that allow skilled players to pull off frame-perfect tech like **wavedashing** and **L-canceling**. While this complex movement adds a high skill ceiling, it also makes matches incredibly hype to watch at the highest levels. The plethora of viable characters and stages in Melee give players plenty of options to flex their mastery. No other Smash game captures that magical "Melee magic" quite like the original. 
### Consistent Chaos - Smash 64
As the inaugural entry in the series back in 1999, **Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 64** laid the foundation for all subsequent Smash games. While it may lack some features of later installments, Smash 64 refined the core competitive gameplay mechanics. Due to its floatier physics, a single opening is often all that's needed to secure a kill. This leads to extremely tense neutral exchanges where one opening can decide a stock. **Every hit matters in Smash 64**, allowing matches to turn on a dime. With dedicated TOs still organizing national events over 20 years later, Smash 64 boasts an impressively dedicated community.
### Balanced Brilliance - Ultimate 
The newest mainline entry, **Super Smash Bros. Ultimate** for Nintendo Switch, is arguably the most **content-rich** game to date. Featuring a staggering 83 characters on launch, including every single fighter from past games, Ultimate delivered fan service in spades. Beyond the massive roster, it reintroduced beloved stages and mashed together mechanics from across the series. Perhaps most importantly, Ultimate streamlined various aspects to produce the most **balanced cast yet**. By trimming down jankier mechanics while retaining depth, Sakurai crafted the most accessible yet competitive Smash to date. With new fighters, modes and events still being added, Ultimate stands as the definitive package.
### Technical Achievements - Smash 4 
In 2014, **Super Smash Bros. for Wii U** arrived as the series' debut on Nintendo's console/handheld hybrid system. Boasting beautiful HD visuals alongside welcome additions like 8-player smash, Smash 4 oozed production values. While its mechanics skewed a bit more casually than prior entires, competitive play still thrived at the highest levels. Moves like Diddy Kong's banana introduced new mindgames to the **neutral-based meta**. Technical innovations also helped push the scene forward, like frame-perfect inputs becoming easier to consistently pull off. Overall Smash 4 elevated the presentation value of the series to new heights. 
### Storybook Adventures - Brawl
2008's **Super Smash Bros. Brawl** for Wii took Nintendo's mascot fighter in a new PVE-focused direction. The single-player adventure, Subspace Emissary, served as aplatform for memorable story moments and boss battles across the game's massive roster. Players young and old enjoyed unlocking characters and reliving key Nintendo franchises. Brawl also introduced gameplay nuances like **perfect shields** and **taunt canceling** to expand combo options. However, its pace leaned quite sluggish compared to predecessors. Certain characters like Meta Knight also warped the competitive viability. While the adventure content delighted, Brawl's slower metagame failed to entice serious players.
### Back to Basics - Smash 64
As the very first Smash game in 1999, **Super Smash Bros.** pioneered the crossover fighting genre blend on Nintendo 64. Representing a selection of eight Nintendo all-stars on just nine stages, Smash 64 laid the basic foundations. Floaty combat and single-hit KOs resulted in fast yet strategic matches reliant on solid spacing and timing. While it lacked later features, Smash 64 flawlessly executed Sakurai's inaugural vision of carefree platform fighting. Over two decades later, dedicated TOs continue fostering a devoted community around intimate eight man brackets perfectly preserving that nostalgic magic. As the original, Smash 64 deserves top marks for birthing this iconic series.
In conclusion, ranking the six main Smash games depends highly on whether examining from a casual or competitive lens. For newcomers, later entries like Ultimate offer most approachable experiences. Hardcore fans gravitate towards Melee and 64 for polished mechanics perfectly supporting high-level competition. Overall, Ultimate manages to be simultaneously accessible yet satisfying for all manner of players, making it a worthy successor as the pinnacle Smash experience thus far. The whole series has shaped gaming history, bringing joy to untold millions across the world over its 25 year reign as the definitive crossover fighter.
So in summary:
1. Ultimate 
2. Melee
3. Smash 4
4. 64
5. Brawl
6. Smash 3DS
