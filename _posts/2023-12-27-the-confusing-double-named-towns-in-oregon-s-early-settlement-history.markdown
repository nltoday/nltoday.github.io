### Gold Rushes and Transient Populations Lead to Duplicate Names
During Oregon's settlement years in the mid-19th century and the subsequent gold rushes, the transient prospecting population led to many towns appearing and disappearing quickly. With so many newcomers founding towns, [duplicate town names](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-papillon-i-may-not-be-rich-and-famous-but-im-a-dog-mom-3) became quite common across the state. The U.S. Postal Service tried to reduce naming confusion by refusing to assign duplicate names to Post Offices, but not all locations had grown large enough to require a Post Office yet. Additionally, the postal service wanted county names included in addresses to further clarify deliveries.

### Granite Used its Name Twice and Independence Even Thrice
One example of duplicate names was **Granite, Oregon**, which was used for at least two different locations. The current town holding the name of Granite was originally called **Independence**, showing that name was used by at least three separate towns. Other names like **Timber, Summer, Lakeview, Pine Creek, Lone Rock, Silverton, Bonanza,** and **Union** each applied to multiple towns over time as well. These naming duplicates caused obvious confusion until one town's population would decline and allow the name to be "freed up".
### Entire Towns Moved Miles Away Due to Railroad and Dam Construction
In the early 20th century, the construction of railroads across Oregon resulted in some entire towns picking up and moving their buildings sometimes miles away from the original site. This was to be nearer emerging rail lines and the new economic opportunities they provided. Later, many dams were built for **hydroelectric power** which flooded out existing towns. Citizens would then rebuild at the new shores of the reservoirs formed, frequently far from the prior townsite. Notable examples include **Detroit** and **Dorena** which both relocated miles from their original under water locations. 
### North Carolina Saw Horseshoe and Horse Shoe Confusion
Other states had their own examples of confusingly similar town names. In North Carolina, the towns of **Horseshoe** and **Horse Shoe** were two entirely separate municipalities pronounced the same way. This led to occasional mix-ups when trying to find one or the other by name alone without including the correct spelling.
### Pennsylvania Boroughs and Townships caused Delivery Headaches
Pennsylvania's **municipal naming structure** of having Boroughs and Townships for smaller geographic units caused plenty of duplicate name issues too. In Allegheny County alone, **Baldwin Township** and **Baldwin Borough** as well as **Elizabeth Township** and **Elizabeth Borough** were four distinct places. And at opposite ends of the state lie **Whitehall Borough** and **Whitehall Township**, no wonder the postal service struggled with timely and accurate deliveries having so many nearly identically named jurisdictions.
### County Names Added to Addresses for Clarification 
To lessen the potential for confusion from multiply named towns across Oregon and many other frontier regions, the U.S. Postal Service adopted the practice through the late 19th century of recommending county names be included in mailing addresses. This allowed differentiation of otherwise duplicate town names that may have resided in neighboring but separate counties. The practice helped clarify deliveries immensely as populations and established postal services grew in these early formation years of communities across the American West.
