### Maximizing Portability with the Right Storage Solution
When considering options for running your game library from an external USB drive, one of the most important factors is choosing a drive with enough storage capacity and fast read/write speeds. As the original commenter pointed out, trying to run an extensive game library from a small 32GB flash drive will quickly become impractical due to storage limitations. [Larger capacity portable SSD drives](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-tote-bag-chihuahua-shopping-bag-chihuahua-chihuahua-gift5365-t-shirt) provide a much more viable solution for housing entire game libraries to play on the go. Additionally, USB 3.0 or higher is necessary to support the data transfer rates needed for modern games without long load times or other performance hits.

### Setting Up Your Game Folder and Storage Location in Steam
Assuming you have an appropriately sized and equipped portable USB drive, getting your games set up to run from the drive through Steam is straightforward. First, plug the drive in and navigate to your Steam settings. Here, you can select the "Steam Library Folders" option and click "Install new library folder..." Then simply choose the desired folder location on your external drive and click select. From there, any games you download or move over will be installed to that library folder on the portable drive by default. 
### Configuring Game Saves on External Storage
For game saves, it varies depending on how each individual title handles save data storage. Many Steam games these days intelligently use Steam Cloud to automatically sync saves to the cloud, ensuring your progress carries over no matter what device you play on. However, some older games may save locally. In those cases, you'll want to verify the save files are actually being written to the external drive folder rather than your computer's internal storage locations. Take note of where save data is stored for any games you regularly play offline without cloud sync.
### Setting Up Mod Libraries on a Portable Drive 
As the original commenter mentioned, housing extensive mod libraries for certain games can quickly eat up storage space. Those with heavily modded games may find benefits to also moving their mod folders and files to the external USB drive. This is done on a per-game basis, but the process is simple enough. Just locate the game's mod folder location normally (usually in My Documents, Steam, steamapps, workshop, content, app ID folder) and move the entire contents to the corresponding game folder on the external drive. Then configure the game to look for mods in the new drive location.
### Expanding Storage with Larger Drives over Time
As your game library grows, you may eventually outgrow the storage capacity of even the largest portable SSD drives available. The nice thing about the external USB solution is it allows upgrading to larger capacity drives painlessly over time. So long as a new drive is USB 3.0 compatible or higher, you can simply migrate your game folders, saves, and mods over during the upgrade process. This makes steadily increasing your **on-the-go game storage** capacities very manageable long term without major reinstallation work.
### Choosing a Durable Drive for Frequent Portability 
When transporting an external game drive regularly, durability should be a consideration as well. Opt for a drive built to withstand bumps and shakes rather than a delicately constructed flash or HDD model. Many portable SSD models nowadays use tough outer casings that can take abuse from being tossed in a bag. It's also wise to invest in a padded case or drive enclosure for added protection while on the go. Taking minimal precautions helps ensure your external drive and games investment lasts through frequent mobile use cases.
### Enjoying Near-Seamless Play Anywhere with Connectivity 
The beauty of having your games library housed externally is you have true portability to play just about anywhere - provided you have a computer or game console with USB connectivity and access to speedy enough public networks or your phone's hotspot. Latency will of course vary depending on link quality, but with 5G networks growing more widely available, the days of jittery remote play over bad connections are fading. For a satisfying **on-the-go gaming experience**, pair that roomy portable SSD drive with a powerful laptop or handheld device.
### Summary
To bring the full utility of your Steam, Origin, Battle.net or other digital libraries anywhere, storing games on an external USB drive delivers unmatched versatility compared to redownloading. Select a generously sized, fast SSD drive to start and upgrade as needed over time. Configure storage locations and save paths properly, then sit back and enjoy low-stressed portable play. Best of all, this set up keeps your entire collection readily at hand, no matter if at home or roaming the planet with laptop in tow.
