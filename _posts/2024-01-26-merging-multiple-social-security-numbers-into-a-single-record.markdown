### Correcting Records and Earning Credits  
Getting your Social Security records merged and corrected is important to ensure your lifetime earnings are properly credited. **The Social Security Administration (SSA)** has established processes to consolidate duplicate records into a single account. The key is to contact them as soon as possible with all relevant documentation. While most field offices are currently closed due to the pandemic, you can set up an online account to review your records for errors and start the documentation process.

### Gathering Comprehensive Identification Materials
It is critical to have identification showing the connection between your names and Social Security numbers (SSNs). Birth certificates alone do not establish identity, so obtain additional documents like driver's licenses displaying name changes. For a legal name change, you will need court records. Also consider hospital birth records or school records that corroborate your date of birth. The more substantiating evidence you amass, the easier it will be to fix any mix-ups in your account information with the SSA. 
### Establishing Online Access for Initial Review
In addition to preparing paperwork, create a my Social Security account through the SSA website. This provides a portal to examine your individual earnings and benefits history. Carefully scrutinize the records for discrepancies involving names, SSNs or dates of employment. Note any inconsistencies you find, as this preliminary online review helps identify the specific corrections needed before an in-person office visit. Addressing issues promptly helps ensure you receive credit for all eligible wages over the long run.
### Scheduling an Appointment at the Local Field Office
Once non-essential businesses reopen in your area following the pandemic, schedule an appointment at your local SSA field office. Explain your unique situation clearly and concisely while presenting the documentation assemblage. Field representatives have experience merging accounts and can directly input any necessary changes into the system. Though in-person interviews are currently suspended, establishing contact lays the foundation for resolving your case once normal operations resume. Follow up regularly until your records accurately reflect your true earnings history and identity.  
### Outlining Your Case Succinctly Yet Thoroughly
When meeting with SSA staff, come prepared with a organized summary of the issues. Concisely explain how you ended up with multiple SSNs yet have confirmation all belong to you throughconsistently presented identity materials. Request consolidation of the accounts and credit for all earnings. Have supporting documents organized chronologically so representatives can efficiently verify your statements. Answer any questions openly and honestly. The goal is demonstrating through clear communication and comprehensive substantiation that rectifying the mistake is necessary to protect your future Social Security benefits.  
### Remaining Diligent until Complete Resolution  
Resolving mistaken SSA records takes diligence and follow through. Check back after your initial appointment to ensure the needed changes took effect. Request written confirmation that all your earnings are now associated with the correct Singleton account. If issues persist, contact your local Congressional representative for assistance. Remain patient, as merging accounts fully may take additional reviews. Stay determined to see the process through until you have verification your lifetime work history and benefits are properly credited. Taking proactive steps now saves complications down the road.
