## Experience 1: Completed within a Week
As per my recent experience, the Aadhar address update process can be really quick. I submitted my documents for an address change on July 26th. After just one day, the status changed to "Validation". Then after another two days, on July 29th, it was completed. When I downloaded my updated e-Aadhar, I saw that the new address had been reflected. The entire process took less than a week. As long as you upload the correct documents, it seems the UIDAI can process an Aadhar address update very efficiently within a short timeframe. 
### Using Bank Statements as Proof
In my case, as proof of the new address, I submitted an ICICI bank statement from the previous month. The statement clearly showed the address I wanted updated at the top. Bank statements are a very [common document used for Aadhar address validation](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/aber) since they provide credible proof of an individual's residence. As long as the address matches what you want updated in Aadhar, bank statements work well.

## Experience 2: Completed within 3 Days 
According to another recent experience, the Aadhar address update timeline can be even shorter. Documents were submitted on July 6th to change an address. By checking the update status regularly, a message kept appearing saying there was a "technical issue" and to try again later. However, on July 13th when the e-Aadhar was downloaded again, the new address had been successfully updated. So in this instance, it only took **about a week for the Aadhar address to be changed**, with the actual processing time being around 3 days once the request was initiated. 
### Constantly Tracking the Status
In this second experience, the individual mentioned continuously tracking the update status using the UIDAI website. Every 12 hours, they would check for any changes like "Pending", "Verified" or "Approval Pending". By relentlessly following up, they were able to see when the process was finally completed. This shows how maintaining regular follow-ups helps ensure the request does not get stuck or overlooked.
## Experience 3: Completed within 2-5 Days
I asked two of my friends about their timelines for Aadhar address updates. One friend had their request processed within **just 2 days**, while the other took a bit longer at **5 days**. Based on what I've come across, the average timeframe seems to be within 5 days in most cases. However, it's possible some requests may get approved even faster at around 2 days. 
### Holidays Can Cause Delays 
One key point is that continuous holidays could potentially cause minor delays. For example, if documents are submitted right before or during a holiday period, it's likely the UIDAI staff would take longer to review. But generally addressing excluding holidays, 5 days appears to be a reasonable upper limit for the Aadhar address update timeline.
## Uploading Documents Online 
I have personal experience of uploading Aadhar update documents online as well. On January 30th, 2017, I accessed the UIDAI portal and uploaded the required proof. Immediately an URN (Unique Reference Number) was issued. Over the next day, by regularly checking the status using the URN, I saw it change from "Pending" to "Verified" to "Approval Pending". To my surprise, on February 1st the update was already completed! I downloaded the new e-Aadhar and it reflected the changed address. The entire process was incredibly fast, ending within just **2 days** of initial submission. 
### Using a Handy Aadhaar Mobile App
To upload documents and track status updates, I used a helpful Aadhaar mobile application. Aside from address modification, the app provides easy access to services like downloading Aadhaar, checking for LPG subsidy and more. Having such an integrated app makes the whole process very convenient. I was impressed at how swiftly the UIDAI managed to process my request online within 48 hours. It really highlighted their capabilities when it comes to **online Aadhar document verification and address validation.**
## Conclusion
Based on these varied experiences, it's clear the Aadhaar updating authority UIDAI has significantly improved their processing speeds over the years. Most address change requests now appear to get completed within an average of 5 days or less. Some may even get approved within just 2 days. As long as valid documents are provided, the online verification process has been shown to work smoothly. Uploading documents digitally and then closely tracking status updates helps ensure timely completion. The rapid timelines demonstrate UIDAI's commitment to **delivering fast Aadhar address updates through efficient online validation. **
