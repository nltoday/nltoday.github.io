### Getting Started
Asphalt 9: Legends offers incredible graphics and gameplay. However, it can be challenging for beginners to jump right in. Here are some tips to get you up to speed.
When starting out, focus on completing the career seasons to level up your garage. [Unlock new vehicles and upgrade parts](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/chihuahua-dog) to progress further in the game. Season 1 features simple races that let you learn driving mechanics. 
For your first car purchases, I recommend the **Audi R8 E-Tron** in D Class and **Scion FR-S** in C Class. Both are easy to handle and upgrade. Aim to at least 3-star each season race for reward packs. Participate in daily trials for credits and blueprint rewards. 
Make sure to join an active club as well. Club rewards include import parts, credits and trade coins which are valuable for upgrading your rides. Help your club mates to receive coins daily.

### Mastering Control and Drifting  
Asphalt 9 emphasizes perfect nitro management and drift skills. Practise drifting around corners in Season 1 races to earn nitro bottle refills. 
Tap the nitro button just before exiting a drift to get a **perfect nitro fill**. Release drift right before impacting walls to avoid spins. Master feathering the throttle/brake for tight drift control.
Certain tracks have long sweeping curves ideal for **nitro-charged drifting**. Time your drifts to gain huge speed boosts down straightaways. Experiment drifting both left and right for optimal lines.
Pay attention to your drift meter - it shows how efficient your drifts are. Focus on green sections for best scores. Purple burst sections mean reaching maximum drift multiplier.
Improved drifting lets you complete career races faster while battling AI drivers for podium places. It's essential for mastering multiplayer as well.
### Choosing the Right Car
As your garage expands, evaluate vehicles based on class, stats and your playstyle. Consider handling, acceleration and top speed. 
Newcomers should focus on D and C class cars like the **Audi R8 E-Tron** and **Scion FR-S**. Both are well-rounded and affordable to upgrade.
For B class, the **DS Survolt** shines with agility and decent speed. It remains competitive into higher leagues. The **Shelby** also performs well with tuning.
In A class, try crowd-favorites like the **Corvette**, **Veneno** or new **Camaro**. Choose one handling style - track, drift or top speed.
Top-tier S class rides like the **Silver Lightning** and **Lamborghini Veneno** unlock later. Consider credit and import part costs before investing.
Always evaluate a car's fully-maxed potential before spending resources. Test different styles in career mode first. Have fun exploring new vehicles!
### Improving Your Skill With Practice
Replaying career season races is a great way to consistently improve driving skills. Focus on specific techniques like near-misses, quick shockwaves or tight drifting. 
Practice complex tracks like Tokyo, San Francisco or Rome multiple times to memorize routes. Run custom streaks for extra experience points. 
Join the Daily Class Cup races even with low-ranked cars. Observe better players' lines and cornering techniques. Challenge yourself to replicate podium finishes.
Master the timing of perfect shockwaves, boost pads, jumps and barrel rolls across all maps. Smooth out braking points and learn alternative routes. 
Record replays of your best runs. Compare to identify areas for cleaning up throttle control or refining drift angles. Small improvements lead to quicker lap times.
With dedicated practice, you'll start Reading race conditions better. Make split-second decisions for shortcuts, drafting or hazard avoidance under pressure. The skills you gain will translate to all game modes.
Steady progress through the career will have you ready to take on challenging multiplayer races in no time. But enjoyment should always be the top priority.
### Mastering Multiplayer Strategy  
Once skilled in single player, venture into intense live races against human drivers from around the world. 
Lower Leagues feature less aggressive players - use this to further sharpen skills without pressure. Observe different driving habits.
In higher leagues, expect tight drafting, strategic drafting and contact. Study the maps to identify defensive positions for holding off rivals. 
Learn to draft different car classes for speed boosts. Drafting S class cars gives the highest top speed increase. 
Time your overtakes carefully through corners without contact. Maintain control through shockwaves and barrel rolls during overtakes. 
Use surprise routes or shockwave/drift moves to pass groups of cars in one go for quicker climbs up the leaderboard.  
Be cautious in peak traffic periods to avoid crashes. Patience and smart racing will earn more VP (victory points) over aggression in the long run.
With consistent multiplayer practice comes car mastery, racecraft skills and expertise to challenge for the top spots on the podium. Your garage and driving will keep improving as you climb up in Leagues.
