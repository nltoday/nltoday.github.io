### Straightforward Calculations
When you're given the selling price (SP) and profit percentage of an item, there are a few ways to calculate the cost price (CP). One straightforward method is to set up a simple percentage calculation.
For the example given of an item with an SP of Rs. 480 and a profit of 20%, we can do the following: 
- Since the profit is 20%, the total out of CP is 120% (100% of CP + 20% profit)
- We're given the SP, which is the total amount (120% of CP)
- Set up an equation: SP/CP * 100 = 120%
- 480/x * 100 = 120
- 48,000/x = 120 
- x = 48,000/120
- x = Rs. 400
So through simple percentage calculations, we can determine that the CP is Rs. 400. This method skips using a formula and goes directly to setting up the percentages based on the information provided.

### Using Profit Percentage Formula 
Another option is to use the standard [profit percentage formula](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-matching-holiday-outfits-shiba-inu-dog-christmas-tree-2) to calculate the CP. 
The formula is: Profit Percentage = (Selling Price - Cost Price) / Cost Price * 100
Plugging in the values given:
- Profit % = 20% 
- Selling Price (SP) = Rs. 480
- Let Cost Price (CP) = x
20/100 = (480 - x) / x
20/100x = 480 - x
0.2x = 480 - x 
0.2x + x = 480
1.2x = 480
x = 480/1.2
x = Rs. 400
Using the formula, we again arrive at a CP of Rs. 400. While it takes an extra step, the formula approach confirms the result of the direct percentage method.
### Solving it Algebraically
For those more comfortable with algebra, the profit percentage calculation can also be set up and solved algebraically. 
Let's break it down step-by-step:
- Profit % = 20% 
- Profit % = (Selling Price - Cost Price) / Cost Price * 100
- 20/100 = (SP - CP) / CP
- 0.2 = (SP - CP) / CP
- 0.2CP = SP - CP
- 0.2CP + CP = SP  
- 1.2CP = SP
- 1.2CP = 480
- CP = 480/1.2  
- CP = Rs. 400
Through algebra, we arrive at the same solution of Rs. 400 cost price. This provides yet another valid method for determining the underlying cost given selling information and profit percentages.
### Summary
In summary, there are a few different approaches that can be used to calculate the cost price of an item when provided with its selling price and profit percentage. A direct percentage method, using the standard profit percentage formula, or setting it up and solving algebraically will all yield the correct answer. Understanding multiple methods provides flexibility in solving these important business calculation problems.
