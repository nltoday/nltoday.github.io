### Foundational Concepts
A wise teacher once illustrated priorities using a jar filled with objects of decreasing size. The golf balls represented family, health and passionsâ€”the most important aspects of life that give it meaning. Pebbles symbolized less crucial priorities like work and possessions. Sand signified miscellaneous tasks that should not overwhelm the others.

When foundations are established early, children can face life's difficulties with balance and purpose.
