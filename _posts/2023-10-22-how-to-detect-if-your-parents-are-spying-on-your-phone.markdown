## Know the Signs
There are a few signs that could indicate your parents may be spying on your phone activities without your consent. Pay attention to subtle changes in their behavior or your phone's behavior that seem off.
### Unexpected App Activity
Carefully check your phone's recently used apps for any unexpected activity. Look for apps running in the background that you did not open yourself. Parental control apps are designed to be discreet, but leaving apps unexpectedly running could be a red flag. Also check if any new apps you did not download appear on your home screen.

### Restrictions Without Your Knowledge  
Your parents may have enabled restrictions or parental controls on your device without telling you. Check your phone's restrictions settings for any limits placed on content, screen time, or installed applications that you did not agree to. The presence of unexplained restrictions could mean your parents set them up to monitor your phone activity.
### Strange Web Search History
Take note if you notice unfamiliar search queries in your phone's web browser history that are not related to your typical searches. Your parents may be surreptitiously checking your search and browsing history for [inappropriate content](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/abbate) or topics they want to restrict you from accessing.
## Set a Trap to Catch Them Spying
One way to test if your parents are spying is to intentionally leave decoy messages or activities on your phone to see if they take the bait. This allows you to catch them in the act of monitoring without their knowledge.
### Leave Tempting Messages in Plain Sight 
Text or message a friend and mention plans to sneak out late at night or details about a party. Leave your phone out in the open after sending the message. See if your parents bring up or question the message later. Their reaction could confirm they saw the tempting message you left out.
### Check If Apps Have Been Activated Behind Your Back
Make sure all apps are closed on your phone, then leave it unattended overnight. Check in the morning to see if any apps were left open that you did not use. The presence of unexpectedly active apps could mean your parents were secretly accessing your phone.
## Examine for Spyware or Parental Control Apps
If setting traps does not reveal spying, carefully examine your phone for signs of spyware or parental control applications installed without permission.
### Check for **Unfamiliar Third-Party Apps**  
Thoroughly look through all apps on your device for any you did not install yourself. Parental control apps may try to disguise themselves as system utilities, calculators or other innocuous default apps to avoid detection.
### Inspect Restriction Settings and Profiles
Closely review your phone's restriction profiles and settings. Unauthorized profiles or limits not set by you could indicate the presence of parental control software monitoring activity from the background. 
### Query Your Mobile Carrier About Unknown Apps
Contact your mobile carrier to ask if any third-party surveillance or filtering apps are associated with your account without consent. Cite privacy concerns if needed. Your carrier may be able to confirm if spyware is installed on your device.
## Consider Resetting Your Apple ID for Fresh Start 
If other detection methods prove inconclusive, resetting your Apple ID tied to the phone may wipe any spyware or profiles installed remotely. 
First, sign out of iCloud and App Store from the phone. Then on a computer, log into your Apple account and select 'Forgot Apple ID or password'. Request a reset via email and choose a new strong password for your Apple ID. 
Logging back into the phone with fresh Apple ID credentials removes any ties to previously installed profiles, wiping any potential spyware or monitoring apps relying on the prior account settings. This nuclear option gives your device a clean slate and bypasses any parental controls previously activated.
## In Summary
By knowing what signs to look for and carrying out tests, teens can detect if their privacy is being violated by unauthorized phone monitoring. While open communication is ideal, this teaches methods to establish digital boundaries when trust is broken by sneaky spying parents. With detection comes knowledge, and with knowledge comes empowerment to take control of one's online freedom and security.
