### Amazing Properties of Prime Numbers
Prime numbers have fascinated mathematicians for centuries. One fascinating property is that 73 is a prime number where both its mirror 37 and the mirror of the mirror 21 are also prime numbers. In addition, 73, 37, 137 and 173 when written in binary are all palindromes. Another example of amazing properties is that if you take any four-digit number with at least two different digits and perform the Kaprekar routine, you will always end up with the number 6174, known as **Kaprekar's constant**, within 7 iterations. This routine involves arranging the digits in ascending and descending order, subtracting the smaller from the bigger and repeating the process.

### Deep Insights into Famous Mathematical Concepts
Some of the most [fundamental mathematical concepts](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/pitbull) have very deep insights behind them. For instance, while we were taught in school that the **surface area of a sphere** can be calculated using the formula 4πr^2, the actual geometric proof is highly non-trivial. It involves conceptually cutting the sphere, unfolding it into a flat disc and relating its area to a sine curve. Similarly, the **Jordan curve theorem** which states that a simple closed curve divides the plane into an interior and exterior region, is a very challenging theorem to prove despite its simple statement. It reveals the complex relationship between geometry and topology.
### Mind-Blowing Facts About Numbers and Their Properties 
Mathematics is full of curious facts about numbers that can leave you amazed. For example, there are precisely 177,147 ways to tie a necktie according to mathematicians' calculations. The **golden ratio** φ≈1.618 has fascinated scientists for centuries due to its ubiquity in nature including architecture, art and even the human body. It is believed that the largest known prime number with over 17 million digits is a **Mersenne prime** of the form 2^p - 1 where p itself is a prime number. The concept of **Gabriel's horn** shakes the assumption that a shape with finite volume must have finite surface area. 
### Hidden Connections and Patterns in Mathematics
Upon deeper exploration, fascinating connections and patterns emerge between diverse concepts in mathematics. For instance, the **digits of π** contain every possible sequence and the **Fibonacci sequence** can be observed in the decimal expansion of 1/89. The **birthday paradox** reveals that in a group of only 23 people, the probability of two people sharing a birthday is more than 50%. **Zero** surprisingly behaves as an even number. The **four color theorem** states that any map can be colored using only four colors without adjacent regions sharing the same color.
### Proving Elementary Concepts and Theorems
It is mind-boggling to realize that even proving basic facts like 1+1=2 or 1>0 requires non-trivial logic and reasoning. The **Principia Mathematica** by Russell and Whitehead consisted of over 300 pages just to prove 1+1=2. Simple geometry constructions that we take for granted like trisecting an angle are in fact impossible to achieve exactly using only a ruler and compass. The **Brouwer fixed-point theorem** and **hairy ball theorem** also have very unintuitive implications in everyday life. This highlights how elementary concepts hide profound mathematics.
### Amusing Anecdotes and Jokes from Mathematicians 
Mathematicians are known for their quirky humor stemming from their deep fascination with abstract concepts. Some amusing anecdotes include that mathematician **Benoît Mandelbrot** named his dog 'Cauchy' because it left residues everywhere. **Paul Erdos** famously said a "comathematician" converts coffee into theorems. The tale of **Srinivasa Ramanujan** impressing Hardy with the number 1729 haunts mathematicians' imagination. These are a few of the many amusing stories that offer a lighter perspective on the serious business of mathematics.
### Open Problems that Remain Unsolved 
Despite tremendous progress, some fundamental questions elude definite answers even today. Whether there are infinitely many **prime numbers** or **Mersenne primes** is a famous open problem. **Goldbach's conjecture** that every even integer can be expressed as a sum of two primes also defies all attempts at proof so far. The seemingly simple statement of **P vs NP** problem has profound implications across computer science but its resolution may require new physics. These unsolved mysteries are a reminder of the vast frontiers still remaining in mathematics. 
### Expanding Horizons Through Modern Generalizations
Mathematicians continually find new abstractions by generalizing classical ideas to more advanced contexts. This includes concepts like **Gaussian Mersenne primes**, **Repunit primes**, **Eisenstein–Mersenne primes** and generalized **Fermat–Mersenne** primes. The notions of **quaternions**, **octonions** and **sedenions** extend numbers to higher dimensions. Researchers now study **arithmetic geometry**, **Langlands program** and **mirror symmetry** bridging disparate fields. These developments showcase mathematics' unlimited potential for creative generalization and cross-pollination of ideas.
I hope these mind-blowing facts covering diverse areas within mathematics leave you with a new appreciation for its profound beauty and scope. The discussion ranged from elementary number theory concepts to deep open problems to amusing anecdotes and modern abstractions - all uniting to depict the grandeur of this field of endless discoveries. Please share your favorite insights from this collection.
