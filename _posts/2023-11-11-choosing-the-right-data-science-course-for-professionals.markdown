Data science is one of the most in-demand fields today. With huge growth opportunities, more professionals are looking to upskill in data science and analytics. However, with numerous online courses and training programs available, it can be confusing to choose the right one. This article provides a detailed analysis of popular data science courses and offers guidance to help professionals make an informed decision.
## Comparing Simplilearn and Learnbay Data Science Programs
Simplilearn is one of the leading providers of online training programs in various technologies. Their [data science certification courses](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/ake) are popular among entry-level candidates and young professionals. The courses cover essential concepts and are self-paced. However, they lack specialization options. 
Learnbay, on the other hand, offers various **domain-focused data science courses** certified by IBM. Students can choose from over 15 industry domains and get hands-on project experience. The small batch sizes allow for better learning and mentorship. While Simplilearn offers standard material, Learnbay's personalized approach is better suited for working professionals.
## Key Factors to Consider When Choosing a Program

### Placement and Career Support  
Evaluating placement record, interview guidance, resume building, and other post-training support can indicate the quality and effectiveness of a program.

Let's analyze these popular options basis the above parameters:
### Simplilearn 
Their flagship Data Science Programs are suitable for freshers and offer IBM certification. Projects are from top companies. However, it lacks specialization and individual mentorship. Placements depend on one's expertise and efforts.
### Learnbay
Their **domain-focused AI and data science programs** include interactive live sessions, multiple capstone projects, guaranteed MNC placements and personalized mentorship. It is highly effective for professionals.
### AppliedAI
