## Moving Steam Games between Drives
### Transferring Games to a New Library Folder
Moving individual Steam games between installed library folders is easy using Steam's built-in tools. First, open Steam and log into your account. Next, navigate to your game library and right-click on the game you want to move. Select [Properties](https://store.fi.io.vn/cute-axolotl-funny-i-axolotl-questions-salamander-265/women&) from the menu, then click on the **Local Files** tab. Here, you'll see the **Move Install Folder** button - clicking this allows you to select a new drive and folder for the game's files. Steam will then swiftly copy the data over. **This avoids having to redownload large game files from scratch.**

### Utilizing Additional Steam Library Locations 
Steam's storage manager makes it simple to designate extra library folders on different drives. To access it, open Steam and go to **Settings > Downloads**. Click on the **Steam Library Folders** button at the top. You can now add new locations by pressing the **+ Add Library Folder** button and selecting a folder. **Games can then be installed to any library**, with Steam prompting your choice on download/install. **This is useful for distributing games across multiple drives to optimize storage.**
## Optimizing Steam Drive Usage with Multiple Libraries 
### Organizing Your Game Collection 
When designating extra library folders, consider how you'll organize your game collection between them. One option is splitting by genre - for example, strategy games on one drive and shooters on another. Alternatively, you could separate by install date or drive size limitations. **Properly organizing your games helps maintain an structured digital library.**
### Managing Drive Capacity 
Being aware of each drive's remaining space allows continued optimal installation placement. Steam's storage manager makes this easy, displaying used and free space per folder. **As drives near capacity, migrating select titles preserves performance.** You may also choose to move older, less frequently played games to free up primary drive space for new releases.
### Maximizing Download Speeds 
Installing to the fastest available drive improves download times for new games or major updates. **Storage type makes a difference** - an NVMe SSD will vastly outpace a mechanical HDD. Consider assessing drive speeds and prioritizing favored games to the fastest media.
## Tips for Migrating an Existing Steam Library 
### Backing Up Game Files
Before making any changes, create a backup of your entire **Steam/steamapps folder** as a precaution. **This provides a restore point if issues occur.** Additionally, backup saves for any games lacking Steam Cloud support to avoid losing player progress.
### Offline Game Installer
Large libraries may take a while to move completely. **Steam's Offline Game Installer lets extracting downloaded content without an active Internet connection**, speeding up the process. It's found under **Steam > Settings > Downloads**.
### Verifying File Integrity 
Once your library migration completes, validate all files are intact through Steam. **Go to a game's properties and select the Local Files tab's "Verify Integrity of Game Files..." option**. **This ensures everything transferred properly without corruption.**
## Conclusion
Utilizing Steam's library folder and storage management tools makes optimizing your installed games across drives simple. **Taking time to thoughtfully organize, backup, and verify your collection ensures smooth access whether playing on a laptop or primary gaming PC**.
