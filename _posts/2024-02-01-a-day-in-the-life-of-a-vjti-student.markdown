## Campus Life
### [A Historic yet Peaceful Campus](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/alewine)
Located in Wadala, Mumbai, VJTI or Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute is an engineering college established in 1887. Despite being over 130 years old, the 16-acre campus still maintains a peaceful atmosphere. Some of the facilities available on campus include a cricket ground, an open study space, and a football court. While the buildings may seem small and outdated due to their British-era architecture featuring gates and windows from that period, students find the interior spaces comfortable enough.

### **Busy Yet Social Student Community** 
With over 5000 students from different engineering backgrounds, VJTI hosts a diverse student community. Many students are CET toppers from Maharashtra as well as other high-performing students from all over India. This means that the campus is always buzzing with academic activities. However, students also make sure to socialize and participate in various cultural and technical events organized throughout the year. Seniors are approachable and help juniors to settle in smoothly without any ragging issues. 
## A Day in the Life
### **Starting the Day in a Rush**
A typical day for most students starts in a rushed manner. Waking up to the alarm, they hurry to get ready while grabbing a quick breakfast, usually an omelette sandwich. Rushing to the department, they pray that lectures have not started yet. Reaching the class just in the nick of time is considered a small victory. 
### **Attending Lectures & Sneaking in Breaks** 
Spending long hours seated in class is no easy task, especially for **civil engineering students** who are known to have the strictest routines. While students try to concentrate during some lectures, they spend other sessions daydreaming, chatting or sneaking in small breaks. Taking thorough notes is important to do well academically. 
### **Struggles of Lunchtime**
The lunch break is a welcome relief but getting food from the canteen during that short duration can be challenging due to long queues. Not everyone is lucky enough to get their meals on time. While mass bunking classes is common in other departments, **civil students** are known to face the department's wrath for such actions.
## Hostel & Campus Life
### **Campus Accommodation**
VJTI has five boys hostels and two girls hostels located within the campus premises. While space may be constrained, hostel rooms are comfortable enough. Leave privileges allow residents to go out until 11:30PM on most days. Amenities like a television room, table tennis facility and study spaces help beat campus boredom. 
### **Socializing & Extracurricular Events** 
Hostel life is when students get to properly socialize, even if it means borrowing items without permission! Cultural festivals like Pratibimb and technical events organised by various clubs see huge participation. Guest lectures by prominent personalities are other regular features. Sports events and informal jamming sessions also help destress from academic pressures.
## Academics & Placements 
### **Pursuing Quality Education**
Though some lecture quality can be inconsistent, VJTI's focus on hands-on learning through projects ensures a robust education. The first year introduces basics while specializations begin in later years. Maintaining over 75% attendance and timely assignment submissions help maximize internal scores, important for excelling academically. 
### **Leading to Lucrative Careers** 
VJTI's strong reputation in the industry is backed by excellent placement rates. Most students secure jobs with average packages of ₹5-6 lakh while some receive over ₹10 lakh per annum offers. Reputed recruiters from sectors like software, manufacturing, finance and more visit campus regularly. This placement success adds to the prestige of the VJTI degree and boosts students' career prospects.
## Campus Food & Hangouts
### **Satisfying Culinary Offerings** 
The economical yet tasty campus canteen is popular for staples like vada pavs and lunch thalis. Finding a patient queue and then a table amidst the bustle is part of the experience. Nearby hangouts like the college cafe and restaurants at King's Circle also satisfy food cravings. 
### **Relaxing in Nature**
Areas like the Five Gardens are favorite spots for fresh air and evening walks amidst lush greenery. Other relaxation options include the chatty Quad area and hostel common rooms. VJTI has thus bred a spirited yet focused student community through its unique campus culture over the decades.
### An Unforgettable Student Experience
Four years pass by rapidly yet leave behind lifelong memories and friendships at VJTI. From first timid steps into this prestigious institution to confidently embracing opportunities, each challenging stage helps one grow both personally and professionally. The best student days come to a bittersweet end with prospects of even brighter futures ahead. Alma Mater VJTI will always remain close to the hearts of its alumni.
