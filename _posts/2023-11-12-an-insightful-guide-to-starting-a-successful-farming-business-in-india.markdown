###Integrated Farming: The Way Forward
Farming and animal husbandry are integrated systems that work together in synergy. This integrated approach to agriculture is both a science and an art that requires personal involvement, at least as a manager. **agricultural land management integrated farming** systems allow farmers to make the most of their resources through judicious crop rotation and reuse of byproducts like manure and biofertilizers. 
###Selecting the Right Plot of Land  
When starting out, it's important to carefully choose a plot of agricultural land with fertile soil and adequate irrigation facilities. The soil should be tested to understand its composition and suitability for different crops. Expansion can be gradual as financial resources permit. **arable land rental agricultural land selection soil testing** ensures crops are suited to local soil conditions and water availability.
###Cash Crops for Higher Income

Seasonal fruits and vegetables cultivated throughout the year also deliver regular income from sales at local markets. **cash crops horticultural crops seasonal vegetables market access** , when properly managed with timely care, pest and disease control, can boost profits for smallholder farmers.
