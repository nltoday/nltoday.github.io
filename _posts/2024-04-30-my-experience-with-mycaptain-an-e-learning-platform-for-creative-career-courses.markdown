Online education platforms have become quite popular in recent years. One such platform, MyCaptain, offers a variety of creative and career-oriented courses. Here is my experience with some of the courses offered on MyCaptain.
### Getting Started with Graphic Design
I decided to enroll in the Graphic Designing course to kickstart my journey as a designer. The course provided comprehensive beginner-level training covering principles of design, visual hierarchy, color theory, typography, and more. Although basic graphic design concepts can be found on YouTube, I appreciated having an interactive experience through live sessions with my mentor. I was able to directly ask questions and get feedback on my design work. My mentor was young and approachable, which made the learning process very comfortable. The course helped lay a solid foundation in graphic design fundamentals.

### Improving Creative Writing Skills 
Not being able to regularly write after college, I joined MyCaptain's [Creative Writing Workshop](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-yoga-chi-chi-namaste-dog-chihuahua-dog) to build the discipline of writing again. The mentor was highly motivating and provided detailed critiques to strengthen our writing abilities. Guest mentors further enhanced the learning through specialized sessions. Well-curated study material covered extensive writing styles and topics. Being part of a community of fellow learners allowed peer feedback. The workshop reignited my passion for writing and helped establish an ongoing practice. 
### Issues with Accessing Technical Courses
Unfortunately, my experience with MyCaptain's technical courses left much to be desired. I enrolled in **Coding, App Development, and Cryptocurrency** programs but faced accessibility problems right from the start. The mobile app was unresponsive, and the website interface lacked polish. It took over a week just to access course content. The quality of educational material itself seemed quite basic. Discussions with facilitators were rare and superficial. While the courses' end projects aimed to be practical, they fell short technically. Comparing to other online learning platforms, MyCaptain's technical offerings seemed disproportionately elementary and lacked depth.
### Positive Community Experience 
One highlight was connecting with knowledgeable peers through MyCaptain's WhatsApp groups. People from varied technical backgrounds discussed projects and solutions extensively. However, this social aspect alone could not compensate for other shortcomings. Neither could the courses fulfill their claims of making learners industry-ready. Issues with even basic functionality like logging into the learner dashboard remained unaddressed despite repeated flags. The overall user experience left much room for improvement versus competitors.
### Room for Growth 
While MyCaptain shows promise in the creative domains through personalized mentorship, their technical vertical seems underdeveloped. Addressing frontend and UX bugs must receive priority. Course modules need revision to convey depth over breadth of topics. Facilitator engagement demands increased consistency and hands-on problem-solving. Competitor benchmarking can help enhance quality standards. With these areas strengthened, MyCaptain may realize its potential to become a leading edtech platform bridging skill-building to careers. For now, their technical offerings seem best avoided in pursuit of serious learning goals. The creative courses, however, deliver solid foundational training through mentor-guided interactions.
