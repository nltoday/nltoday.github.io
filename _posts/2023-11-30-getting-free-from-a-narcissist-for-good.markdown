## Understanding The Dynamics
Narcissists can dominate your life if you let them. Their mind games are designed to manipulate and control you, leaving you constantly second-guessing yourself. The only way to break free is by understanding how they operate and taking decisive action.

At first, narcissists may seem charming and attentive. But over weeks, months or years, their true colors emerge as gaslighting, blame-shifting and emotional abuse escalate. Trust your instincts - if something feels "off", take note of worrying behaviors and patterns of disrespect. Do not ignore red flags or excuses made for cruel treatment.

### **You Are An Object, Not A Person** 
To a narcissist, others exist only to serve their own ego and sense of self-importance. They view relationships as a means to an end rather than a caring partnership between equals. Your feelings, needs and boundaries mean nothing to them. Once they have "used you up", they easily discard and replace you. 
### **Going No Contact Is Vital**
Cut off all means of communication - block them on calls, texts, social media and emails. Do not explain or engage with any attempts to hoover you back in. Having even limited contact keeps you vulnerable to manipulation. Staying no contact is the surest path to healing and moving on with your life free of their poisonous influence.
## Taking Practical Steps For Closure  
Getting away from a narcissist for good requires decisive action on your part for both emotional and practical reasons. Here are some tips:
### **Change Your Contact Details**
Get a new phone number to avoid unwanted calls, texts or voicemails. Update contact details at work, with friends and on services. Freeze your credit to prevent identity theft. Vary travel routines and be vigilant for signs of stalking. 
### **Have Their Belongings Returned**  
Ask a friend to collect any remaining items from the narcissist and have nothing further to do with exchanging property. Do not Jekyll back any gifts, even if used as bait to hoover you. Maintain no contact at handovers.  
### **Seek Therapy For Support**
Talk through your experiences with a qualified counselor to process emotions, recognize patterns and build confidence. Their expertise helps validate abuse suffered and accelerate healing. Support groups also aid recovery from narcissistic relationship wounds.
### **Document Any Harassment** 
Keep records of unwanted contact attempts in case a restraining order becomes necessary. Screenshot concerning messages and logdates/times of incidents. Inform local police as a precaution rather than escalating situations yourself. Safety should be the top priority in severing ties permanently. 
## Moving On With Your Life
It takes time, but with support and conscious efforts, life after a narcissist is very much possible. Here are recommendations for rebuilding your sense of self and happiness:
### **Prioritize Self-Care** 
Look after your physical, mental and emotional wellbeing through nutritious eating, exercise, rest, hobbies and meaningful activities. Nurture supportive friendships by spending quality time with caring people. Give yourself permission to feel sad or angry sometimes too.  
### **Learn About Healthy Relationships**
Educate yourself on relationship red flags, boundaries, communication styles and what true empathy/respect look like. Apply these insights to how you interact with potential new partners. Do not rush into anything serious for a while. Learn to value yourself first before another can.
### **Focus On Personal Growth** 
Rediscover hobbies, career goals or studies that were sidelined due to the ex's demands. Set SMART goals for areas of your life that matter most. Your self-worth isn't defined by anyone else. Take small steps daily towards the independent, happy and accomplished person you were always meant to be. 
Leaving the past behind and living fully again is possible. Stay determined, learn from mistakes and keep surrounding yourself with people who truly care. In time, memories of the narcissist will fade as you thrive. You've got this - your future is bright!
