Corrupted system files can cause unexpected problems on your computer like inability to open folders. Here are the steps to fix corrupted system files using the System File Checker tool:
When system files become corrupted, it can lead to [ issues opening folders and accessing downloads](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-american-foxhound-dog-santa-hat-ugly-christmas-2). The **System File Checker** is a built-in Windows tool that scans for and repairs corrupted files. Running it is a simple process to restore normal folder functionality. 
To start, open the Start menu and type "Command Prompt" to search for it. Right-click the top result and select "Run as Administrator" to launch Command Prompt with elevated privileges needed for the scan. In the Command Prompt window, type "sfc /scannow" without the quotes and press Enter. 
This will start the System File Checker process. It will take some time, usually 5-20 minutes depending on your system, to scan through all protected system files. You can minimize the Command Prompt window and continue using your computer as normal during the scan process.
Once finished, the Command Prompt will display if any corrupted files were found and whether they were repaired. Review the results carefully - if it reports no infractions found, then the problem persists. But if it lists repaired files, restart your computer to complete the changes. 
Try accessing the **Downloads folder** again after restarting. If it now opens without issue, then the System File Checker successfully corrected the problematic system corruption preventing the folder access before.  
### Further Troubleshooting
If the System File Checker does not resolve the Downloads folder access problem, there may be **deeper software or hardware issues**. A few things to check:
Make sure there is enough free space on the storage device where your Downloads folder resides. Insufficient space can lead to issues. You can free up space by uninstalling unnecessary programs or emptying the Recycle Bin. 
Check for any other software programs, especially antivirus or firewall programs, that may have **download restrictions or folder block policies in place**. Look through their settings and policies to disable anything blocking Downloads.
Run a full scan with your antivirus program in case a virus or malware is affecting the system files related to folders and downloads. Quarantine or remove any threats found.
As a last resort, reset **Windows permissions** on the drive with the Downloads folder using Disk Cleanup or Command Prompt. This restores default ownership and permissions on files and folders that may have been corrupted. 
If the folder problem still persists after all troubleshooting, it may be time to consider reinstalling Windows to replace any low-level system file corruption. This ensures a completely fresh start.

### Conclusion
Being unable to access the Downloads folder can disrupt productivity and frustrate computer usage. But with methodical troubleshooting of system files, software and security programs, permissions and filesystem using the built-in Windows tools, the cause can usually be identified and fixed without needing to reinstall the OS.
