Visiting the remote areas of rural India after dark can lead to strange encounters. Here are a few true stories of spiritual experiences and paranormal phenomena.
### A Late Night Visit
It was a late night and R was studying alone in his dorm room like usual. Around midnight, he heard a soft knock at the door. When he opened it, a [faint misty apparition of a small boy](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-autumn-fall-pumpkin-truck-mappe-thanksgiving324-chihuahua-dog) stood before him, with a chunk of his head missing and blood dripping down. The spirit held out his hand and said in a weak voice "I was in an **accident, can you please give me some blood**?" The ghastly sight caused R to pass out on the floor. 
The next day, R was shaken to discover a news report of a **10-year old boy who died the previous night** in a car accident just miles from campus. The deceased child's photo was an exact match to the spectral visitor who begged for blood at R's door.

### A Frightening Encounter in the Hospital
One night, nurse Mom fell ill with fever while working an overnight shift at a Kolkata hospital. As she lay in her room trying to rest, the door suddenly opened and a man in a white coat entered. But his appearance became more disturbing—with each step, his face morphed into someone Mom recognized, including her own family members.  
When he placed his cold hand on her neck to check her temperature, she felt an intense chill. Then he began strangling her as his face shifter between loved ones' visages. In a panic, Mom grabbed her Hanuman idol and recited a prayer. The figure let out an unearthly howl and vanished. She fled to a colleague's room, shaken by her encounter with the strange **shape-shifting entity**.
### An Empty Third Bed
Engineering student Shewta was assigned to share a hostel room with another girl, Priya. But Priya began acting strangely—sleeping all day and barely responding when awake. One night, Shewta woke to find Priya sitting up with wild hair and an inverted textbook. When Shewta called to her, Priya whispered "SLEEP" with red, staring eyes. 
The next day, Shewta requested a room change, citing her unease living with Priya. But the warden had shocking news—the third bed in Shewta's room had never been filled, and **no one named Priya was ever assigned as her roommate**.
### A Phantom Visitor Seeks Help
My friend's story involved his sister who was living in the girls' hostel of her new engineering college. One night, his sister woke to find her **roommate breathing heavily and muttering**. When his sister tried talking to her, the girl screamed and ran out of the room in a panic. 
The next day, his sister learned that her roommate had been hospitalized for a mental breakdown. While being treated, the roommate recalled seeing **a girl in a white sari who begged for help**, though no other students saw this phantom visitor. 
### Terror on an Isolated Highway 
One night, my brother was traveling down a deserted highway with friends after visiting a religious site in Deoghar. As they drove through the darkness, my brother started telling ghost stories—including one a friend experienced. Just then, a girl appeared on the road ahead, causing their car to swerve to avoid hitting her. When they looked back, **the girl had vanished without a trace**.
Shaken, they decided to stop for the night at a nearby lodge. But during dinner, the lodge owner informed them that the area was known for sightings of **a girl dressed in white who appears on the road**, sometimes leading to fatal accidents. They slept little that night, unnerved by the local paranormal lore.
### My Mother's Close Encounter
My mum has always been a very spiritual person working as a nurse. One night, as she lay sick with fever in her hospital quarters, she had a terrifying otherworldly encounter. A man appearing as a doctor entered her room, but with each step his face morphed between people she knew. When he grabbed her neck, his touch burnt cold as ice. 
Just as the apparition began choking her, my mum reached for her Hanuman idol and recited a prayer. The figure let out an unearthly scream before disappearing. Even today, my mum only feels safe with her holy statue nearby, convinced she faced some kind of **malevolent shape-shifting entity** that nightlong ago.
