## The Popularity of Minecraft
Minecraft has been hugely popular since its release in 2009. With over 100 million copies sold, it is one of the best-selling video games of all time. One of the main reasons for its sustained popularity is the creative freedom it provides to players. In **Minecraft, players are able to build structures, creations, artwork, and even functioning machines** using various blocks in a 3D procedurally generated world. This allows for unlimited creativity and gives players a feeling of achievement from their creations. 
Parents also find Minecraft to be educationally valuable as it teaches kids **principles of engineering, construction, and history through the various structures they can build**. Many teachers have also incorporated aspects of the game into their lessons. Its popularity with both children and adults gives it a very wide demographic reach. After over a decade, Minecraft is still popular and beloved by many, showcasing its timeless appeal and creativity.
## The Rise of Fortnite
Released in 2017, Fortnite quickly became one of the biggest games worldwide through its free-to-play **battle royale gameplay.** Fortnite blew up through its last-man-standing 100 player online matches and expressive building mechanics. It amassed over 250 million players in its first two years. 
However, Fortnite's popularity may have peaked. Recent reports show a **decline in concurrent players and Twitch viewer numbers.** Many speculate this is due to players moving to new battle royale games like Apex Legends. Additionally, Fortnite's young core demographic will become saturated eventually. While still popular, Fortnite will need to innovate to stay relevant long term.
## The Fresh Appeal of Apex Legends 
When Apex Legends released in 2019, it took the world by storm. With its **focus on team-based battle royale with hero characters**, Apex Legends appealed to both Fortnite and Overwatch fans. It amassed over 50 million players in its first month.
Apex Legends has maintained popularity through frequent content updates introducing new characters and maps. Its **playerbase has remained steady over seasons**, showing strong player retention. Additionally, its popularity on Twitch gives it great exposure potential for new players. 
With its appeal to eSports through balanced squad-based gameplay and skill-based matchmaking, Apex Legends could see sustainable popularity for many years. However, it remains to be seen if it can topple Fortnite from its throne long-term.
## Minecraft Remains the Most Enduring
While Fortnite and Apex Legends have enjoyed explosive popularity spikes, Minecraft remains the most consistently popular and longest-lasting of the three. After over a decade, it continues to see strong sales numbers and an engaged playerbase. 
Minecraft's focus on **creativity, building, and shared experiences** provides enduring entertainment value that shooters struggle to replicate. Its simplicity also means it appeals to both kids and adults. With constant support from Microsoft, Minecraft will likely remain popular and beloved for many years to come.
Its cultural impact is also unmatched, with shows, movies, toys and more based on the blocky world. Even today, many new players are still discovering Minecraft for the first time. This kind of multi-generational appeal is rare for any game. While trends come and go, Minecraft's creativity ensures its popularity will stand the test of time.
## Variety is Key to Online Gaming Success
In conclusion, there is no definitive "best" game amongst Minecraft, Fortnite and Apex Legends. Each game's strength lies in a different appeal that resonates with certain gamers. Long-term success in online gaming is found by providing variety, fun gameplay and constant innovation to retain audience interest. 
While battle royale games like Fortnite and Apex Legends see explosive spikes, Minecraft has proven that **creativity, community and constant support** can sustain a game for many years to come.
