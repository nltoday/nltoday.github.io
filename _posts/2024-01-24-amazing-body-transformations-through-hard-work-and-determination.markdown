### Starting from Rock Bottom
Agonized by poor body image and family struggles, Mark was eager to turn his life around. At just 108 pounds and constantly stressed, he reached his lowest point during freshman year of high school. But over the summer, he made the decision to change through building muscle at the gym.
Mark went for his first workout feeling ashamed, out of shape, and lacking form. A kind gym-goer taught him proper chest press technique, emphasizing repetition over weight. Mark persisted through frustration and fatigue, finding escape and purpose. 
Within months, Mark gained ten pounds of lean muscle by consistently lifting and eating more frequently. Feeling better about himself, he was determined to keep progressing.
