### Genetics and Development
The color of a person's eyes is determined by the amount and distribution of pigments in the iris, which is the colored part of the eye. The two main pigments responsible for eye color are melanin (brown pigment) and lipochrome (yellow pigment). [The presence and interaction of these pigments](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-crazy-havanese-lady-dog-lover-v-neck-t-shirt/men&) determine the various eye colors, such as blue, green, hazel, and brown. Typically, a person's eye color is genetically determined and remains relatively stable throughout their life. However, some individuals may experience changes in their eye color due to developmental factors when they are young. Babies are often born with light-colored eyes that may change within the first few years of life. This is because the production and distribution of pigments in the iris can change as the eye develops.

### Lighting, Surroundings, and Emotions 
Eye color can appear to change based on lighting conditions and the colors of the surroundings. The pigmentation of the iris may not change but different wavelengths of light entering the eye are absorbed and reflected to varying degrees by the iris pigments. **this can cause subtle changes in apparent eye color.** Some individuals report that their eye color changes with strong emotions. However, scientists say that eyes don’t change pigmentation due to emotions. It’s more likely that lighting, fatigue, or hydration level affect the appearance of eye color rather than emotions directly affecting pigmentation. 
### Perceptions of Eye Color Change
While true pigmentation changes are rare, many people are convinced their eye color shifts in different situations. **This could be due to perceptions rather than physical changes in the iris.** Memories are fallible and we often see what we expect or want to see rather than objective reality. To truly study eye color shifts requires careful documentation with color photos over time in a controlled setting. Asking family and friends who've known someone for years could also help validate reported changes. Perceptions of change may say more about human psychology than biology in many cases.
### A Case Study of Changing Eyes
One person who reports dynamic eye color changes across situations is a woman in her late 30s. She recalls her eyes being more green and hazel as a child but now they appear predominantly blue. Are her eyes truly changing pigmentation or is this a case of fallible memory and lighting influences? To investigate:
- Childhood photos show green eyes like she remembers 
- Current photos in natural light show blue with some green and brown spots
- Under incandescent light, the green and hazel tones stand out more
- When photographed angry or excited, the green becomes more prominent 
- Friends and family confirm her eyes were greener in youth but blue as an adult
- A year of regular photographs in controlled lighting show no changes with mood
In this case, it seems lighting, aging and **perceptions have combined to give the impression of emotional color changes rather than true iris pigmentation shifts. Environmental factors alone are sufficient to explain the different tones observed at different life stages and emotional states.** While some flexibility is normal in infancy, the iris generally maintains a stable pigment pattern in adulthood. More research would be needed to conclusively prove or disprove claims of emotionally contingent eye color mutation.
### Genetic Basis for Dynamism 
Rare cases have been documented where eye color has changed significantly throughout a person's life due to genetic factors. About 16% of Europeans have a gene variant called HERC2 that regulates OCA2 expression and melanin production levels in the iris. **Individuals with this polymorphism are more prone to dramatic color changes from childhood to adulthood.** Studies found up to 25% of children with two copies of this variant saw a greater than three-shade shift in their eye color as they matured. It's thought progressive melanogenesis regulated by this gene influences pigment deposition patterns through life history. Outside of unique genetics, environmental perceptual effects provide the most plausible explanation for reported eye color variability.
### Conclusion
In the vast majority of cases, a person's eye color is genetically fixed from an early age. However, lighting, reflections, memories and developmental changes in infancy can all affect how eye color is perceived to shift situationally. **Rare genetic variants may predispose some individuals to true pigmentation transformations through life.** While people's experiences of dynamic, emotion-tied eye color changes feel quite real to them, current scientific understanding points to illuminative, perceptual and developmental factors as more likely drivers of reported variation than direct mood influences on iris biology. Continued research could uncover more complex genetic underpinnings or edge case scenarios where eyes may functionally alter hue across one's lifespan.
