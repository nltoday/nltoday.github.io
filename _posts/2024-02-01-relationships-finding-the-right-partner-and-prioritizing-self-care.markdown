Every person deserves to feel wanted and cared for in a relationship. Far too often, we settle for partners who do not truly value us or make us a priority. Through personal experiences and wisdom shared, this article aims to encourage readers to stand up for themselves and not accept less than what they deserve from a significant other. It also stresses the importance of independence, communication and taking breaks when needed to build healthy relationships.
### Taking A Step Back 
When issues arise in a partnership, separating temporarily can provide much-needed perspective and space. This was evident in the case of the author's parents who separated for three years after his mother's upset. Although difficult initially, the break allowed both individuals to work on themselves and rebuild what was lost. Absence made the heart grow fonder, and they went on to celebrate **forty blissful years of marriage.** Separations do not have to mean the end if both parties are willing to communicate, understand each other's needs and rediscover what first brought them together.

### Guarding Personal Freedom
No one person should comprise another's entire world or define their self-worth. It is natural and healthy for individuals to pursue solitary interests and spend quality time with friends or doing activities they find meaningful. When partners do not respect each other's independence or autonomy, resentment is sure to build over time. Regular breaks away from the relationship provide a chance to restore one's sense of identity beyond just being part of a couple. These solo experiences encourage personal growth and ensure each person brings fullness to the relationship rather than solely deriving happiness from their significant other. 
### The Power of Self-Care
Prioritizing one's physical, emotional and mental wellbeing should never be considered selfish. Yet love can make us lose sight of caring for ourselves as deeply as we care for our partner. Needing space does not equate to not loving or wanting the relationship long-term. It simply shows one values maintaining their individuality and happiness apart from any romantic entanglements. Communicating such needs and setting appropriate boundaries is important for relationship longevity and satisfaction on both sides. Unless both compromise and tend to themselves too, burnout is inevitable which damages intimacy and trust over the long-haul.
### Resolving Issues with Understanding 
During my parents’ rough patch, staying connected albeit physically apart was crucial. My father remained actively involved in family events and provided stability through consistent contact, showing his commitment had not wavered. When comfort was needed, he supported from afar with empathy, patience and care for my mother’s wellbeing too. Their willingness to dialogue openly and work through difficulties together ultimately resuscitated what was broken initially. Respect, compassion and effort on both ends were the foundation for reconciliation years later. With open and honest conversations, many relationship problems **can absolutely be overcome or resolved.**
### Recognizing Self-Worth
We all long for an intimate partner who admires and chooses us wholeheartedly without doubt or reservation. Someone who sees us at our worst but loves us unconditionally just the same. While maintaining realistic perspectives about imperfections, settling for lukewarm affection or half commitments is selling ourselves short. As affirmed here, we deserve someone sure about building a future with us. If not, it is better to walk away before resentments grow rather than wait on the sidelines, confused about where we stand or our ability to be loved fully just as we are. Our time and hearts are far too precious to invest in wishy-washy situations or anything less than mutual, unambiguous devotion.  
### Finding the Right Match
This collection of perspectives promotes important values of independence, self-respect and ensuring compatibility in any serious relationship endeavor. Beyond attractiveness or ambition, what truly matters is aligning at the core with someone who prioritizes nurturing your wellbeing and happiness. Recognizing these relationship essentials early, being discerning and choosing self-care over undesirable bonds or conditions prevents winding up in damaging situations later. With compassion and willingness to understand another's journey, any obstacles can potentially be overcome. But we must stand up for ourselves first before dedicating to fully sharing life with an individual who profoundly 'sees us'.
