### Finding fakes in the Grand Bazaar
Istanbul is known as a shopper's paradise with its numerous shops selling various goods. One can easily find replica designer items in the city, especially around the iconic Grand Bazaar. Some of the stores in and around this historic marketplace offer high-quality replica bags, belts, watches and other accessories. While not exactly cheap due to their near-perfect imitation of original designs, these fakes are still much more affordable than authentic products. Shopkeepers are aware of the quality and set prices accordingly. In fact, a Hermès store employee was shown a fake bag from one of the bazaar shops and couldn't tell the difference from what was sold in her store. This shows how convincing some of Istanbul's replica goods can be.
