### Why We Want Them Back
Despite the trauma, we remember the positive aspects of the relationship with a narcissist - the love bombing, attention, and intense passion. This creates very strong feelings and memories for us. We idealize the narcissist and forget the pain caused by their unpredictable behavior and lack of empathy. We miss the rush of emotions and feeling deeply connected to another person. [Traumatic bonding](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-chihuahua-rainbow-unicorn-lgbtq-ally-dog-lover-mom-dad-v-neck-t-shirt/women&) makes it hard for us to let go and move on.

### The Relationship Cycle with a Narcissist 
Relationships with narcissists follow a predictable cycle. After an intense **honeymoon phase**, they suddenly turn cold, distant, and critical. This **push-pull dynamic** causes emotional turbulence and fuels **codependency**. Feeling confused and craving their love and approval again, we try hard to change their dislike towards us. But their moods remain unstable and hurtful incidents keep recurring. Over time, the cycles become shorter and more stressful until no-contact is the only way to regain mental well-being.
### Why Narcissists May Come Back
Narcissists see themselves as superior beings who are entitled to constant admiration. They need regular **hits of narcissistic supply** from others to boost their fragile ego. If their usual sources dry up or become inconsistent, they may return to past partners as a temporary supply. Sex is also a strong incentive as narcissists tend towards addictive behaviors. By hoovering exes, they regain a sense of power and control in being able to manipulate past victims once more.
### How Narcissists Operate During Hoovering 
When a narcissist decides to hoover an ex, they will try to catch them off guard after a period of no contact. Pouncing with lovebombing behaviors like compliments, gifts and promises of change, their aim is to confuse and dismantle any no-contact boundaries set. They strategically appeal to emotions to weaken resolve. If the ex responds positively, a new cycle of idealization and devaluation will certainly begin, with a worsening pattern over multiple hoover attempts. The only predictable outcome is more trauma and damage.
### Should We Let Them Back In?
While the desire to reunite is understandable, continued interaction only serves the narcissist's selfish needs, not the healing of their victim. Letting a narcissist back allows them to further erode self-esteem and reignite trauma bonds. Recovery involves rebuilding independence without the narcissist. While no-contact is challenging, it is the healthiest path forward towards forming balanced relationships in future. Staying determined not to engage regardless of hoover tactics is key to ultimately overcoming traumatic bonding
### Finding Closure and Moving On
When a narcissist relationship ends, there is a profound need for explanations that will never come. Accepting we may never understand their actions fully is part of finding inner peace. Focusing on personal growth, spending time with supportive people, and engaging in fulfilling activities gently fills the void they left. With time and self-care, thoughts of the narcissist fade. New healthier bonds form, and we enter a new chapter, stronger for what we overcame. True closure comes from within, not from them.
