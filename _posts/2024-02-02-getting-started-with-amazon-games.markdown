### Download and Install the Amazon Games App
Amazon Games is a digital distribution platform that allows you to download and play games without needing other launchers like Steam. To get started, you'll need to download the Amazon Games app from their official website. This app acts as the hub for browsing, purchasing, and launching all Amazon Games titles. It's available on Windows and macOS. Once installed, sign in with your Amazon account to access your game library.

### Check System Requirements and Update Drivers
Before diving into a new game, always confirm your PC meets the minimum system specifications. You can find these details listed on the Amazon Games page for each title. Outdated components could cause issues. Also, keeping your graphics card drivers up-to-date is important. Many performance or crashing problems stem from outdated display drivers. Take a few minutes to check for and install any pending updates.
### Disable Antivirus and Firewalls Temporarily  
Some antivirus and firewall programs can erroneously flag game files or processes, disrupting launches. If you're having trouble getting a game to work after other troubleshooting, consider temporarily disabling these security programs as a test. Just be sure to re-enable them once you've resolved the game issue. Disabling alone may resolve compatibility glitches caused by overzealous protection software.
### Run as Administrator for Full Access
Like most PC games, Amazon Games titles require administrator privileges for full access to system resources. If a game fails to launch or crashes shortly after startup, right-click the executable and select "Run as administrator" from the context menu. This ensures the process has unrestricted access to install, update, and run without limitations imposed by standard user accounts.
### Contact Amazon Games Support
Exhaust all troubleshooting steps before giving up. But if nothing seems to work, your best bet is to get direct help from the source. Amazon Games offers customer support through phone, email, and online ticketing. Have details like your Amazon account, game name, hardware specs, error messages, and troubleshooting actions taken ready to provide support representatives. They may be able to pinpoint the root cause and offer solutions not found elsewhere.
### Do All Amazon Games Require Steam? Understanding Different Launch Methods
While the Amazon Games app is the centralized hub, there is variety in how individual titles are actually launched. Some Amazon Games are standalone and only require the Amazon Games app. However, popular cross-platform games like [Lost Ark](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-custom-proud-football-grandma-number-28-personalized-women-v-neck-t-shirt/men&) and **New World** use Steam as their underlying technology platform. These "Steam games" on Amazon will prompt you to link a Steam account during setup to utilize Valve's services like matchmaking, achievements and more. But buying these games through Amazon still allows playing without a separate Steam purchase. So in summary - not all Amazon Games are "Steam games," but some high-profile titles do integrate with Steam under the hood.
### What Happens If an Online Games Platform Like Steam Shuts Down?
A legitimate concern for any games purchased through digital storefronts is accessibility long-term if the platform goes offline. If Steam or any other service closed permanently, many rightfully worry their purchased libraries would be inaccessible. While EULAs and platforms claim ownership, most gamers feel games they bought are truly theirs. If a shutdown did occur and normal support stopped working, taking independent measures like piracy to preserve access seems understandable given it was purchased media. Still, hopefully responsible mitigations occur before any platform sunsets to ensure customers can still enjoy the games they legitimately own. Dialogue around digital ownership rights as technologies evolve remains important.
### In Summary: Getting Assistance and Resolving Amazon Games Issues
Troubleshooting problems yourself using basic methods should always be the first step when an Amazon Games title isn't working properly. Check system specs, update drivers, try reinstalling, disable unnecessary programs - these simple solutions often do the trick. But sometimes more specialized help is needed. Do not hesitate to directly contact the Amazon Games support team if you've hit a wall. Their representatives have extensive diagnostic procedures and resources to pinpoint complex issues. With their assistance and a little troubleshooting on your end as well, most any compatibility obstacle can usually be resolved when playing Amazon Games through their platform.
