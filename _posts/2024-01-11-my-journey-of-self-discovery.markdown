### The Beginning of My Search
I had always felt like something was missing in my life. No matter what I accomplished - good grades, a high-paying job, lots of friends - I still felt unfulfilled. Deep down, I knew there had to be more to life than constantly chasing external measures of success and validation. But I didn't know where to start looking. 
One day, while mindlessly scrolling through social media, I came across some inspirational quotes about living with purpose and finding your true self. [Something resonated](https://store.fi.io.vn/mommysaurus-mom-mom-2-kids3091-t-shirt) with me, and it got me thinking more about what was really important to me and how I wanted to spend my time on this earth. This sparked the beginning of my journey of self discovery.

### Peeling Back the Layers 
The first step was getting really curious about who I was at my core. So I started journaling - writing down my likes, dislikes, strengths, weaknesses, values, hopes and dreams. This helped uncover parts of myself I hadn't paid attention to in a long time. I also began meditation, which gave me space to quiet my busy mind and tune into my inner wisdom. Through these practices, I started **peeling back layers** to get to know Daisy from the inside out.
### Connecting with My Inner Child
One theme that emerged early on was how disconnected I felt from my **inner child self**. As an adult, I had become so serious and driven by external factors. But in my journals and meditations, memories from childhood kept bubbling up of a time when I felt truly happy, playful and present. I realized this joyful spirit was still there, just buried underneath mountains of shoulds and responsibilities. I began making more time for unstructured play, creativity, silliness and nature - ways to reconnect with that magical inner child within.
### Listening to My Body's Wisdom  
Another key part of understanding myself fully was paying attention to what my body was trying to tell me. So I started a daily movement practice - whether it was yoga, dancing, hiking or swimming. I also focused on nourishing my body with whole, unprocessed foods. By listening more closely, I discovered stress signals, energy levels and cravings that provided valuable clues about what truly energized versus drained me. This bodily awareness also brought a new sense of **deep appreciation** for my amazing vehicle that carried me through this life.
### Forging Deeper Relationships
As I peeled back layers of myself, I realized how disconnected I felt from really meaningful relationships. Many of my interactions had become routine or surface level over time. So I committed to deepening bonds with family and cherished friends by being genuinely present whenever we connected. This often meant leaving distractions like phones out of the way and actively listening without judgment. By **focusing on human connections**, I began feeling truly seen and supported in a way I hadn't in a long time. 
### Finding My Purpose 
All of these self reflections and discoveries led me to a profound realization - I had a deep passion for helping other people through difficult life transitions just like the one I was experiencing. With guidance from mentors, I discerned how to channel this purpose into meaningful action. I decided to become a life coach after realizing **how impactful the right conversations and community could be.** Helping others on their own journeys gave my life a direction and flow it had been missing. I finally felt wholly aligned in mind, body and spirit.
### An Ongoing Journey
My search for self awareness continues to this day, always evolving as I change. What started as a curiosity has become a lifestyle of daily mindfulness, gratitude practice and living fully present. While the destination is never fully “arrived at,” I’m so grateful for the foundation these early self exploration years provided. Now, at its core, my life mission revolves around empowering others through authenticity and wholeness from within. I’m still learning and growing every day, but feeling a deep connection to my true essence makes this journey infinitely more enriching.
