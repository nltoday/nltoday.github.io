### An Unusual Start
It was an exciting yet worrisome start to my journey at IIT Bombay. My father and I had embarked on a train journey from Siliguri to Mumbai with all my important documents and certificates. However, to my dismay, all my bags containing these crucial papers were [stolen overnight](https://store.fi.io.vn/funny-boxer-dog-lover-47-boxer-dog) during the train journey. With no way to prove my identity or admission to IIT Bombay, my father and I lodged a police complaint in Patna.
Upon arriving in Mumbai, we headed straight to the **Kurla police station** to file an FIR. After narrating our unfortunate tale to the admission officials at IIT Bombay with just a copy of the FIR, I was granted **provisional admission** on the condition that I provide duplicate documents within 3 months. It was a huge relief to have finally made it to my dream institution, despite the unusual start.

### Settlement into Student Life  
Those initial few days were spent settling into my new hostel room and getting accustomed to campus life. The **small and dirty room** seemed like a prison cell at first. I struggled with loneliness as everyone focused on arranging their own spaces. Meals at the **mess hall** consisted of oily curries served by shouting staff. 
However, things quickly improved. I began interacting with other residents and making new friends. Within a short time, that tiny hostel room felt more like a comfortable home than a cell. Shared meals and conversations in the mess hall became highly anticipated daily activities.
### Academic Rigors and Growing Responsibilities 
The academic expectations of IIT Bombay soon came into focus. Classes were **immensely challenging** yet stimulating. Late-night study sessions in the hostel became the norm as assignments and exams demanded full dedication. 
Along with coursework, **leadership opportunities** also arose in student clubs and technical festivals. Taking on new roles helped broaden my horizons beyond books. Managing budgets, coordinating events and building teams cultivated valuable organizational skills. Juggling academics and extracurriculars was no easy feat but proved hugely rewarding.
### Campus Adventures and Memories
Between academic pursuits, there was plenty of time for fun activities across the scenic campus. Impromptu basketball games, jam sessions at the audio room, and movie marathons in the festivities were regular stress-busters. Winters were best spent curled up by the bonfire with friends, exchanging stories and snacks late into the night. 
Attending cultural programs and sporting tournaments as a spectator was just as thrilling. Crowds cheering together for the home team injected a strong sense of community spirit. Spontaneous road trips exploring the nearby city breaks provided cherished experiences to reminisce for years to come. Each day seemed to spawn new memories to treasure forever. 
### Lasting Impacts and Fond Farewells   
Before I knew it, five incredible years had whizzed past. As my final semester drew to a close, a tinge of nostalgia and reluctance accompanied the sense of achievement. The roommate who began as a stranger was now family. Corridors that once appeared intimidating felt more like home than anywhere else. 
Graduation ceremonies marked both the end of one meaningful phase and the beginning of countless new opportunities. While alumni paths may diverge worldwide, the bonds and lessons from campus will remain with us always. IIT Bombay has profoundly shaped who I am today, for which I am eternally grateful. Its incredible community continues to inspire and support me even years after donning the final graduation robes. True to its motto, the institution has empowered me to **change the world** through all it has equipped me with.
