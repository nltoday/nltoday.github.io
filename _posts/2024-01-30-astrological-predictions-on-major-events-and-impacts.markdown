## The Changes are Coming
The relationship was ending in July 2020 but it will still take over a year, until November 2021, for the finalization of the marriage to occur. This shows the complicated emotions involved in such a personal transition. 
### A Taurus Sun with Capricorn Moon
Melania Trump's astrological profile reveals much about her personality. With a Taurus sun and Capricorn moon, she values stability, tradition and avoids unnecessary drama. This likely explains why she endures challenges at home for the sake of keeping peace, even if she acknowledges it causes problems. Her pragmatic nature helps her manage demanding circumstances with composure.

## A Scorpio Ascendant Foreshadows Trouble  
Back in November 2020, the predicted progressions indicated Donald Trump would become increasingly erratic as his ascendant progressed into Scorpio in January 2021. With this fiery water sign stimulating his emotions, he seemed ready to lash out in [retaliation](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/german-shepherd) and **vengeance** before a new administration could take over. Whether events escalated depended on the company he kept and level of enabling from his inner circle.
### A Solar Eclipse Spoke of Difficult Times Ahead
When adding the Aries ingress into Taurus in early January 2021 and the preceding December 2020 solar eclipse, the timing aligned for significant change. Solar eclipses often precede tumultuous periods, confirming Trump faced hardship in the coming months. This paralleled real world events, like the U.S. Capitol insurrection on January 6th when transits collided with progressed placements.
## Astrological Alignments Signal Pivotal Moments
Powerful occurrences tend to happen where transits intersect with astrological progressions. On January 6th specifically, several components converged to mark that date as primed for disruption. The ingressed Aries energy fueled impulsive behavior while Trump's Scorpio ascendant amplified his fervor. Under these astrological auspices, the insurrection manifested.
### Western Astrology Illuminates Personalities and Potential Outcomes
Looking back, the predictions from November 2020 accurately anticipated Trump moving into a highly volatile and destabilizing period. His rejection of the election outcome became increasingly extreme as shown by world events. With insight into planetary alignments and chart placements, astrology can illuminate personalities and the likelihood of various outcomes during times of significant astrological weather changes.
## Macrocosmic Forces Met With Microcosmic Progressions
When transits align with natal positions and progressed placements, individuals can experience internal shifts reflecting the potent external climate. On January 6th, turbulent planetary transits highlighting aggression, passion and defiance perfectly dovetailed with Trump's personal journey. The macrocosmic cosmos and microcosmic individual evolution converged to bring instability to a head.
### A Consequence of Free Will Within Fated Parameters  
While astrology reveals probabilities, it does not determine free will decisions. Trump retained autonomy over his actions even as planetary configurations primed him for heightened reactivity and volatility. The insurrection arose from a mix of free choice exploiting an opportunistic window, with astrological signals accurately predicting such a window would emerge. Overall events demonstrate astrology's ability to enlighten without enforcing outcomes.
## Lessons for Applying Astrological Insight Responsibly
By understanding astrology's capacity to illuminate tendencies and timing yet not dictate fetes, we can apply its wisdom judiciously. Rather than make accusations, we can have compassion for those undergoing challenging transits while cautioning possible impacts. We can also prepare for difficulties by gaining self-awareness into weaknesses corresponding to our own chart. In all, astrology cultivates perspective on both individual journeys and collective Change Points.
### The Ongoing Relevance of Astrology Across Eras
From ancient times practitioners have studied celestial omens for navigation of life's passage. Modern events prove this discipline retains relevance, as eclipses, transits and progressions shed light on Trump's climactic period. Just as astrology forewarned of his coming difficulties, it continues illuminating current affairs and individuals. Its enduring ability to synthesize the macrocosmic and microcosmic realms keeps astrological philosophy and its nuanced insights pertinent across eras.
