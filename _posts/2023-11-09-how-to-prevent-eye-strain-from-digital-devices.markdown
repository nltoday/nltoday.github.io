Digital devices have become an indispensable part of our daily lives. However, excessive and prolonged use can lead to various eye-related issues like blurry vision, headaches, dry eyes and fatigue. This article discusses some effective techniques to prevent eye strain from screens.
## Take Regular Breaks from Close Screens 
As mentioned in the input, keeping a distance of at least 28 inches between your eyes and the monitor can help reduce eyestrain. However, maintaining such a distance is not always possible when working on smaller screens like phones and tablets. [Taking microbreaks every 20 minutes](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/agan) is key to giving your eyes a chance to re-focus at a distance and relax the ciliary muscles that control focus. Simply look away from the screen and focus on a distant object for 20 seconds. Blinking your eyes a few times can also help rehydrate the eyes.
### Move Your Eyes Around Frequently
Our eyes tend to strain when fixated on one spot for too long without movement. To counter this, make it a habit to move your eyes around the screen and periphery frequently instead of staring at one small area. You can scan the room from left to right or look out the window every few minutes. **Following the 20-20-20 rule** of taking a 20 second break to look at something 20 feet away every 20 minutes of screen time can significantly reduce eyestrain.

## Adjust Screen and Font Size Appropriately  
Squinting to read small text or view dim screens puts extra pressure on the eyes. Ensuring adequate contrast, **brightness and font size tailored to your eyesight** can make a big difference. On phones and tablets, increase the font size to at least the mid-range setting. Adjust the screen brightness close to ambient light levels. Use magnification/zoom features if needed when working on small screens or documents for long periods.
### Reduce Blue Light and Glare
Prolonged exposure to blue light emitted by digital screens has been linked to digital eye strain, disrupted sleep and other issues. **Blue light blocking eyewear** can help filter out high energy visible (HEV) blue light without distorting colors. Installing blue light filters on devices and enabling ''night light'' modes are other options. Also be mindful of ambient lighting - direct overhead lights or shiny screen surfaces can cause undesirable glare. Adjust lighting and placement to minimize reflections.
## Maintain Proper Posture and Positioning
Sitting awkwardly with head down and poor posture places undue strain on the neck and eyes. Keep your **device 20-26 inches away** and at eye level to avoid hunching. Support your back with a comfortable chair and keep shoulders relaxed. Place any documents or materials you refer to in line with the screen to avoid unnecessary eye or neck movements. Taking brief standing breaks every 30 minutes will also help reduce tension.
### Wear Prescription Eyewear as Needed
For those who require vision correction, make sure to wear **updated prescription glasses** or contact lenses as directed by your eye doctor. Glasses specifically designed for digital device use with progressive or bi-focal lenses can be beneficial. Cataract, glasses designed to reduce glare are also being developed. Consult an eye care professional for a comprehensive eye exam, especially if experiencing persistent symptoms even after following recommendations. Early intervention can prevent long-term damage.  
## Maintain General Health and Lifestyle Factors
Factors like nutrition, hydration, sleep and stress levels have a significant impact on overall eye health as well. Aim for a **diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins A, C, E and minerals like zinc and lutein** that support eye function. Staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water is critical. Most adults need 7 to 9 hours of quality, uninterrupted sleep daily. Managing stress levels through activities like yoga, meditation or spending time outdoors in green spaces can also help reduce digital eye strain.
### Make Professional Software Adjustments 
If you spend long hours on the computer for work, discuss ergonomic adjustments to your workstation with your employer. Options like adjustable desks that allow standing or sitting, larger high resolution monitors tailored for your work may help reduce prolonged focusing demands. Software like text-to-speech, magnification features and screen masking tools can be useful accessibility aids as well. Employers should be open to reasonable accommodations that allow employees to work safely and productively without risking long-term eye health issues. 
By balancing screen time with the above techniques, you can maintain comfortable, rested vision and prevent serious eye problems down the line. Remember - our eyes deserve breaks just like the rest of our body. Be kind to your eyes to keep your vision sharp!
