### Adding Non-Steam Games to Your Library
To add games downloaded and installed outside of Steam to your library, you need to follow a few simple steps. First, open the Steam client and click on the "Games" menu at the top. Select "Add a Non-Steam Game to My Library" from the dropdown. This will open a file browser window where you can navigate to and select the executable file (usually with a .exe extension) for the game you want to add. Once selected, the game will be added to your Steam library. 
By adding non-Steam games this way, you gain some benefits of having them on Steam. For one, the game will now show up in your library and on your profile as being played. Friends will be able to see what specific game you are currently running. You also get access to Steam [overlay features](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-crazy-rednecker-my-funny-redneck-boyfriend-v-neck-t-shirt/men&) like the browser, screenshots, and notifications even while playing a non-Steam title. It essentially connects the game to your Steam account without any special launchers or installers required.

### Configuring Game Properties for Administrator Access 
Some games may require administrator privileges to run properly, such as installing custom mods or configs. If the game was downloaded and installed outside of Steam without admin access, it cannot leverage those elevated permissions on launch. To remedy this, you need to configure the game properties to always run as an administrator, even when launched through your standard user account.
First, right click the game's executable file and select "Properties." Go to the "Compatibility" tab and check the box next to "Run this program as an administrator." Now whenever you launch the game from your Steam library or directly, it will automatically elevate permissions to run with full admin rights. Just be aware this bypasses the usual Windows User Account Control (UAC) prompts. So only configure it this way for trusted programs to avoid potential security issues.
### Safety Tips for Downloading Games from Unofficial Sources
While sites providing free games can expand your library without cost, they also present risks if not approached carefully. Make sure to only download from trusted sources with a good reputation. When installing or launching a game for the first time, pay close attention and abort the process if anything suspicious is detected, like unexpected extra toolbars or programs trying to install. Be extra vigilant of browser pop-ups or redirects asking you to click through to the actual download. Always have ** antivirus software** running scans regularly to catch any potential malware. 
Some free game download hubs may seem sketchy due to aggressive or misleading ads, but actually have few security issues when using carefully. As an example, "Steam Unlocked" has delivered many virus-free games when following basic precautions. The key is knowing how to identify and avoid malware while still taking advantage of alternative game libraries with a little online research and street smarts. Applying common sense goes a long way towards safely expanding your collection without the budget.
### Utilizing the Steam Overlay with Non-Steam Games
Even without official Steam integration, you can still leverage many of its valuable overlay features when playing outside titles. By adding the games to your library as non-Steam games, that connectivity is automatically established when launching them through Steam. From within a game, pressing Shift+Tab will pop up the familiar overlay dashboard. Here you can access options like screenshots, notifications, in-game browser, friends list, and more without disrupting gameplay. 
The overlay is useful in many scenarios, such as sharing highlights, quickly checking messages without alt-tabbing, or consulting online walkthroughs without closing the game. It provides a level of Steam functionality that wouldn't otherwise be possible. Some developers may even choose to add full Steamworks integration over time, expanding on these basic overlay hooks. Overall, taking advantage of the slight configuration boosts the experience for non-Valve games substantially by introducing convenient extra tools at your fingertips.
### Getting Games to Show on Your Profile and In-Game Status 
Aside from overlay access, including non-Steam titles in your library provides social benefits too. Any game you launch through Steam will show your friends what specific program is currently running. They can see at a glance that you're diving into a fresh RPG adventure or battling online in a MOBA. Your full game history and playtime stats will log hours spent in officially Steam games but not outside ports. 
However, simply starting a third-party game through the client still broadcasts your playing status to contacts. This is useful for discovering what friends might be open to grouping up in or just keeping tabs on each other's daily gaming habits. The added contextual information can spark new co-op sessions or discussions based on shared interests. Overall, bringing all your games under the Steam roof unifies your profile and social experience, even for additions not purchased through Valve's digital storefront.
### In Summary  
Utilizing Steam's features for non-Steam games provides multiple advantages whether related to functionality, social connectivity, or just organization. With some minor configuration tweaks and knowing how to safely obtain outside titles, you can fully integrate these additions into your Steam library and profile without compromises. It brings extra utility to your existing games collection while also creating opportunities to explore new options. Best of all, Steam's suite of overlay tools and social features become universally available regardless of a game's integration level.
