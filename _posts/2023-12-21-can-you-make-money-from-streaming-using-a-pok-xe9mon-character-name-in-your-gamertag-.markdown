### Fan Art or Copyright Issue?
According to the [Legal Information](https://www.pokemon.com/us/legal/) page on the Pokémon website, distribution of any kind of "derivative works" based on Pokémon's intellectual property, which would include using character names in things like gamertags and streaming personas, constitutes a **royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license** for The Pokémon Company to use that content however they like. In plain English, this means that by including a Pokémon character name in your online identity, you are essentially giving Pokémon full control and ownership over anything you create while using that name, without compensation.

### No Expectation of Payment or Approval
The legal terms also make it clear there is "no further consideration or compensation of any kind" expected for fan art and derivatives. Pokémon also does not need to seek approval from the creator on how their content is used. This removes any possibility of taking legal action over the use of one's work, as well as cuts out any negotiation on things like revenue sharing or creative control. Streamers using Pokémon names would have no claim to monetization or say in how their streams are referenced or promoted.
### Waiving Moral and Publicity Rights 
Perhaps most importantly, the terms state creators give up any rights to take issue if Pokémon's use of their work "violates any of their rights." This includes moral rights to object to modifications, as well as publicity rights over one's public image and brand. A well-known streamer relying on a Pokémon character for their persona could lose control over how that identity is represented with no recourse.
### Priority on Brand Protection
While fan art is generally tolerated for non-commercial uses, if a streamer's monetized content positioned a Pokémon character prominently without permission, it could threaten the company's ownership claims. Pokémon's legal priority would be protecting trademarks and copyright rather than individual enthusiasts' endeavors. Direct challenges to their control present risks they have little incentive to accept.
### Uncertain Waters for Profiteers 
All this considered, a streaming career built substantially around an unlicensed Pokémon character carries significant risks. Major platforms prioritize cooperating with rightsholders, so a dispute could see problematic content removed without warning. While casual uses face little threat, significant commercial exploitation of Pokémon's properties may overstep what the company allows as incidental fan activity. Proceeding with eyes open to these potential consequences is advisable for ambitious streamers.
### Alternative Approaches
Fortunately, expressing fandom does not require appropriating full character names. Tributes through wordplay, personalized logos, or reference alongside original work can still engage communities while avoiding legal issues. Working with - rather than against - companies respects creators' investments while enabling complimentary opportunities. Overall a cooperative spirit tends to foster the most understanding outcomes between fans and rightsholders.
### In Summary
The answer is unclear if profiting extensively from another's copyrighted works constitutes fair use. While prosecution remains unlikely for modest amateur efforts, significant commercialization removes buffers protecting individuals. Both legal risks and respect for creative ownership counsel moderation in such cases. Alternative forms of tribute can still achieve one's goals within mutually agreeable norms.
