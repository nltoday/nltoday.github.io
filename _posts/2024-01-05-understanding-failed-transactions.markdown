Failed transactions occur when a payment is deducted from the payer's account but does not reach the intended payee due to various technical or network issues. Common reasons include invalid beneficiary details, server errors, payment declines due to insufficient funds, and more. As soon as a transaction fails, the bank or payment service provider initiates an automated refund within a set timeframe. 
However, manual intervention may be needed in some cases, especially if the refund is not credited within the standard period. It is essential to follow up promptly to avoid missing out on refunds or delays in getting your money back. This guide outlines the typical timelines and processes to claim refunds for different failed payment methods in India.
### Refunds for Failed SBI Card/Net Banking Payments 
If you used an [SBI debit card](https://yt.io.vn/collection/alejos) or made a payment via **SBI online netbanking**, any failed transaction will be automatically reversed within a few working days. SBI refunds typically process within 5-7 working days from the transaction date. 
However, in some cases, it may take an extra 2-3 working days beyond the expected timeline. But you should receive an SMS notification confirming the refund credit once it's complete. SBI has an efficient system to identify and reverse failed payments without any action needed from customers.

### Handling Failed UPI and Third-Party Payment Refunds
For failed transactions made via **Unified Payments Interface (UPI)** services like PhonePe, Paytm, Google Pay, and other third-party merchants, the process differs. Since these are not directly linked to your bank account, you will need to raise a dispute with the respective payment app or website. 
Contact their customer support team through email or call centers, providing details of the failed transaction along with screenshots if available. Representatives will initiate a refund request after verifying transaction records. Resolving such complaints typically takes 5-10 working days. You may have to follow up if the refund is delayed beyond the expected timeline shared by customer support. 
### Claiming Refunds for failed IMPS/NEFT Payments
**IMPS** and **NEFT** are instant money transfer services that facilitate inter-bank fund transfers in India. Failed transactions via these modes may take 2-7 working days for automatic reversals depending on the bank. Most public sector banks refund within 5 working days.
However, in some cases, the funds may not be credited back even after the standard period. Here, you need to **raise a ticket with your bank's customer support team** by visiting the branch in person, calling the helpline, or sending an email. Provide all necessary details like transaction reference ID, payment date and time, amount, and your account details. 
Bank representatives will initiate an inquiry and reversal process that usually takes an additional 7 working days. You will receive confirmation through SMS/email once the failed transaction amount is credited to your account. Be sure to follow up proactively if the refund is delayed beyond the resolution timeline committed by the bank representative.
### Handling Delays or Disputes in Refund Processing  
While most refunds for failed bank transfers, card payments, and third-party transactions process automatically within a week, delays can happen due to technical issues or lack of coordination between intermediaries. 
If you do not receive the refund amount by the expected deadline, first check your account and transaction history for any pending credit. You can also contact the bank's customer support or respective payment service provider to inquire about the refund status and resolution timelines. 
Escalate the issue and provide all supporting documents if initial follow-ups do not help expedite refund processing. As a last resort, you can also lodge a complaint with bodies like the Banking Ombudsman who will investigate and help resolve disputes independently. Most refund related issues should get addressed within 30 working days of the initial complaint through the appropriate escalation channels.
