## Elytra and Fireworks
Elytra can be found in the End ships located in the outer end islands. Carefully search the ship **chest** for the **elytra item**. Be watchful of nearby **Shulker** mobs that can deal damage. 
Once obtained, craft some **firework rockets** using **1 paper and 1 gunpowder** as the recipe. **Fireworks** allow prolonged flight when used with the elytra. Simply equip the elytra, then use fireworks by right-clicking to launch into the air. 
The height and duration of flight depends on the type and quantity of **firework stars** added. For sustained flight, use plain firework rockets without additional stars to avoid damage. With practice, skilled players can glide and maneuver through the skies.
## Slow Falling Potion Flight
Brew a **Potion of Slow Falling** using a **nether wart**, **phantom membrane**, a **water bottle** and **blaze powder** at a **brewing stand**. 
Add the membrane last for the desired effect. Optionally add **redstone** to increase the duration from 90 seconds to 4 minutes. 
Drink the potion and leap from heights to gently float down. For added control, equip elytra and drink the potion mid-air to smoothly glide longer distances. The slowed falling allows safer and longer flights across the landscape.
## Shulker Bullet Technique 
This method requires **Shulkers** to make direct contact. Wear protective **armor** and bring up resistance with **potions**, **beacons** or a **golden apple**. 
Let the Shulker shell impact send you flying backwards. Steer the trajectory by looking around with minimal falling damage. Punching the Shulker resets its attack, allowing multiple launches in quick succession.
## Trident of Riptide
The **Trident** enchanted with **Riptide II** acts as a rocket launcher from water. Simply stand in water, throw the enchanted trident skyward and hold right-click to launch upwards on impact. 
Release at the peak for a smooth glide down. During rain, the effect activates from any height, turning storms into perfect flying conditions. With practice, players can achieve expert trident control and maneuverability.
## Taking Advantage of Rain
As mentioned, rainy weather works with a Riptide-enchanted Trident even on land. However, rain provides **another flying benefit** - it saturates the ground, allowing you to **briefly hover** by right-clicking with an empty hand. 
Though slow, it allows crossing small gaps. Combined with other techniques, rain partially negates fall damage and grants additional airtime to maneuver mid-flight. With some skill, players can stretch a single rain cloud into an impromptu flying session.
## Conclusion
While mods add many fantastical flight options, Vanilla Minecraft provides clever methods to take to the skies. With the right preparations and practice of techniques like Elytra, Slow Falling Potions, Shulker Launching, Tridents or Rain Jumping, players can achieve impressive and scenic flights without any extra mods installed. Mastering natural flight opens many creative possibilities for builds, paths and adventure across the game's vast worlds.
