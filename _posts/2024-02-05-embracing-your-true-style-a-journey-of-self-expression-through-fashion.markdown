Phoebe's personal style journey has been one filled with admiration for aesthetic looks, self-discovery despite societal pressures, and a desire to authentically represent herself through what she wears each day. Over time, she has learned to let her freak flag fly by embracing more feminine styles influenced by Asian fashion trends as well as classic American basics, regardless of what others may think. Here is her ongoing story told in several parts.
### Inspiration From Beautiful Dresses 
Phoebe has always been drawn to [vintage style dresses](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/abdo) and thinks they would make the perfect outfit for any occasion. However, she understands that many in society now view such retro fashions as mere costumes rather than everyday wear. This saddens her, as she believes feminine women should feel comfortable displaying their interests through fashion without judgement. The photos of lovely **lace mini dresses** and floral print maxis she saw only fueled her longing to freely express herself this way.

### Appreciating All Types of Femininity
Growing up, Phoebe noticed a tendency to look down on girls with very **feminine traits and interests**. This she felt was unjust, as a woman's strength comes in many forms regardless of how stereotypically "girly" or "tomboyish" her presentation may be. All should feel empowered to explore and showcase their authentic selves through style. She dreams of a world where feminine fashion is celebrated once more without limitations or critics.
### Desires Versus Realities 
While Phoebe admires eye-catching **Asian street style outfits** and envisions dressing that way daily, practical concerns hold her back. As a student without much income, affording trendy clothes from brands like Brandy Melville is a challenge. She must make do with what is in her existing closet rather than curate her ideal **ulzzang fashion** aesthetic. For now, her true flair remains an inspiration rather than a reality.
### Appreciating Simplicity 
Upon reflection, Phoebe has come to appreciate that true style comes from within rather than expensive accessories or labels. Some of her favorite outfits are very simple, like well-worn jeans and a **ribbed tank top**. Classics like **cut-off shorts** can look equally as charming as elaborately designed dresses. With her unique perspective and confident personality, she learns to shine regardless of cost.
### Building Self-Acceptance
Phoebe's journey has been one of growing self-acceptance. Where she once worried what others may think of her interests or presentation, she now focuses on feeling comfortable in her own skin. By following fashion blogs and connecting with like-minded people, she gains inspiration and reassurance to let her authentic flair show through in a way that feels right for her life stage. Her advice to others would be to embrace individuality and **let the freak flag fly** joyfully each day.
### A Future of Endless Possibilities  
Although Phoebe's style options remain limited for now, she looks forward to a future filled with endless possibilities of self-expression. Whether experimenting with daring cuts or classic silhouettes, high price tags or thrifty finds, her ultimate goal is to feel unashamed wearing whatever best represents her inner spirit. With a nurturing of self-love and empowerment over time, she trusts that her fashion journey will only continue to blossom in wonderful new directions that excite and fulfill her creatively.
