### Experience Gain Distribution 
The Experience Share key item functions differently in Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire compared to previous generations. **Pokémon that participate in battle[ now gain ](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/aguillon)100% of the experience points** from defeating opposing Pokémon, while the **rest of the party that does not battle directly** will receive **50% of the experience points** gained. This means that if the leading Pokémon earns 400 experience points from a battle, it will gain the full 400 experience points while the rest of the team will each gain 200 experience points. By frequently swapping Pokémon in and out of battle, trainers can earn **up to six times the normal experience points** compared to only using one Pokémon for each fight.

### Stat Training Distribution
In addition to sharing experience points, the Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire Experience Share also distributes **effort values (EVs)** between all Pokémon in the player's party. EVs are **bonus stats** that Pokémon can earn by defeating specific types of opponents. For example, defeating a Zigzagoon would award the victorious Pokémon with **+1 speed EV**. When multiple Pokémon are gaining experience from battles using the Experience Share, any EVs earned are distributed proportionately among the entire party. Trainers need to be aware that each stat has an **EV cap** beyond which further gains in that stat become ineffective.
### Raising Weaker Pokémon Safely 
One benefit of the updated Experience Share is that it allows trainers to raise weaker Pokémon in their party without risking them in direct combat. By having the weaker Pokémon hold the Experience Share while a stronger team member battles, that weaker Pokémon will still earn half the experience and EVs to gradually grow stronger. This ensures that the **entire team can progress together at the same pace**. No longer will trainers need to bench less developed Pokémon for long periods - with Experience Share, even reserve team members can train up to the level of the frontline fighters.
### Maximizing Experience Gain 
Trainers looking to **power level their team** and maximize experience gain have a few strategic options when using Experience Share. Frequently swapping in different Pokémon to battle will net close to **six times the normal experience per battle**. Keeping a single Pokémon in combat provides around 3.5 times the baseline experience due to both the participant and reserves getting shared rewards. By sweeping many weaker opponents with a rotation of team members, it is possible to **greatly outpace the standard experience curves**. Just a few focused training sessions can bridge large level gaps.
### Resetting Effort Values 
While Experience Share streamlines stat earning, trainers must be aware that pumping EVs over the cap is wasteful. The O-Powers bag item allows **resetting all EVs to zero** with a special reset item when unwanted stat assignments occur. It's easy to get carried away optimizing both levels and stats, so remembering to reset periodically prevents diminishing EV returns. Proper EV training complements the powerful Experience Share and enhances competitive teambuilding potential in Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.
### Convenient Advantage 
Overall, the reworked Experience Share provides tremendous convenience for player progression. With half credit even for passive participation, the entire party can develop cohesively at an accelerated pace. Its benefits encourage less micromanagement of reserves too. For players facing challenges or seeking perfection, the Experience Share enables rapid adjustments to overcome new obstacles. Its balanced distribution of rewards makes Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire some of the most accommodating main series Pokémon games for casual and competitive players alike.
### Competitive Applications 
While useful for general progression, the Experience Share has competitive applications too. It allows refining full teams efficiently rather than focusing on just a few frontliners. With shared EVs and levels, competitive breeders can **pre-train entire squads** of similar creatures for varied game styles and situations. Experience Share streamlines establishing baseline stats for evolving and breeding as well. Even seasoned players gain from its convenience, whether casually experimenting or rigorously optimizing. Combined with other tools like Super Training, it forms a robust framework for **competitive team preparation in Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire**.
### Summary 
In summary, the Experience Share update fundamentally changes how players can approach leveling and stat training in Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. Its balanced and streamlined distribution of experience and effort values rewards swapping teams for maximum gains yet still supports holistic squad development. Whether casually enjoying the region or competitively fine-tuning teams, the Experience Share delivers tremendous value. It rightly earns its status as a Key Item for revolutionizing progression in the Hoenn remakes.
