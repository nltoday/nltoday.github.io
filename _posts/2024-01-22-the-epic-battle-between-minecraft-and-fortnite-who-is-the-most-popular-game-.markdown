### The Rise of Minecraft 
When Minecraft was first released in 2009, it quickly rose to popularity among both children and adults. **Open-world sandbox survival game** allowed players to explore, gather resources, craft items and build virtually anything they can imagine using textured cubic blocks. The simple yet innovative gameplay idea struck a chord with many people. In its early years, Minecraft thrived as more and more players fell in love with the joy of creative building and survival challenges the game offered.

### The Emergence of Fortnite
However, as the 2010s came to an end, a new contender emerged that threatened Minecraft's dominance - Fortnite. Released in 2017 by Epic Games, **battle royale third-person shooter** Fortnite took the gaming world by storm with its last-man-standing 100-player games on a shrinking map. Bright, cartoony visuals and free-to-play model made Fortnite accessible to players of all ages. It quickly became a mainstream phenomenon, spreading like wildfire through social media. Fortnite's popularity skyrocketed as top streamers and celebrities joined in on the fun, captivating audiences worldwide. 
### A Revival for Minecraft 
Yet just when it seemed Fortnite had replaced Minecraft as the most popular game, Minecraft staged a comeback. In recent years, Minecraft saw a massive surge in players both old and new. Part of this resurgence could be attributed to Minecraft's educational merits which parents appreciate. Through the game, children learn creative problem-solving, collaboration and skills in history, engineering and architecture as they build miniature versions of real-world structures. Meanwhile, Fortnite suffered negative press over claims that its addictive nature and microtransactions targeted children. 
### Comparing Popularity Metrics
So the question remains - which is truly the most popular game between Minecraft and Fortnite? To find an answer, we can analyze different popularity metrics:
### Google Search Traffic 
One way is to examine Google search traffic trends over time using Google Trends. Data shows that Minecraft consistently tops search volumes, outperforming Fortnite. Even during Fortnite's peak in 2018, Minecraft maintained its lead in this category. The longevity of Minecraft's popularity through search is remarkable.
### Monthly Active Player Count
Looking at official monthly active player counts released by developers provides another perspective. With over 126 million monthly players as of 2019, Minecraft remains the best-selling video game of all time. While Fortnite topped at over 250 million registered players in its prime, Minecraft's player base has proven more resilient long-term. 
### Streaming Viewership 
Streaming platforms like Twitch offer live viewership stats. During 2018-2019 when Fortnite was at its peak, it commanded larger concurrent viewers than Minecraft. However, Minecraft saw a comeback in 2020 while Fortnite numbers declined. This suggests Minecraft may have surpassed Fortnite in terms of current streaming interest.
### Decline of New Contenders 
Other games that sought to dethrone Minecraft and Fortnite like Apex Legends could not sustain popularity over the long run. Apex rose quickly but fell off top charts within a year. This shows how difficult it is for new titles to displace the dominance of Minecraft or Fortnite in today's saturated market.
### In Summary 
When considering multiplefactors like consistent search trends, sustainedplayer counts and comeback in streaming, it is fair to say Minecraft has reasserted itself as the most popular game overall–an amazing achievement for a title entering its second decade. However, Fortnite still enjoys a massive following andinfluence. Ultimately, both games have carved out loyal, long-lasting player bases through their compelling designs–a testament to their successes.
