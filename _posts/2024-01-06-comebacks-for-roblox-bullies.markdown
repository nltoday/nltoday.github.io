### Introducing Short Insults and Clever Comebacks
ROBLOX can be a really fun place to play games and connect with friends. However, sometimes other players may try to ruin your fun by bullying you or saying mean things. While it's usually best to just ignore bullies, sometimes a short, clever comeback may help shut them down quickly so you can get back to enjoying your game. Here are some ideas for quick comebacks you could try if someone is pestering you.

### Turning "Mirror" Insults Around 
One common taunt bullies use is saying "I'm not your mirror" to imply the other person looks ugly. However, you can easily turn this insult back around on them with a comeback like "Yeah, glad I'm not your mirror either because if I was, I might smash myself out of disgust from seeing your face every day." This shows them their lame insult doesn't bother you and actually makes them look bad instead.
### Responding to Body Comments Creatively
If a bully makes rude comments about your avatar's appearance, like saying you're "built like a fridge," don't take it personally. Just get creative with your retort, such as "At least I'm not built like Gru from Despicable Me like you." Saying it with a laugh shows you aren't upset and makes them look silly for insulting someone else's looks.
### Using Their Own Insults Against Them 
When someone uses a common insult against you like "Sorry I don't burn trash," don't simply repeat it back at them—that's just engaging further and won't solve anything. Instead, turn it around into an insult about them, for example "Nothing's been burned more than your family's reputation thanks to that ugly face of yours." This redirects their negative energy while still shutting them down quickly.
### Cutting Through Stubbornness With Silliness
Dealing with stubborn bullies who just want to argue can be frustrating. When they refuse to stop pestering you, sometimes the best approach is to respond with a silly insult that makes them look dumb, like "Are you an animal? Because I can't understand what you're saying with that ugly mug of yours." Say it with a laugh to show you think their bullying is a joke, which will frustrate them more than any serious insult ever could.
### Reversing "I Don't Care" Comments Expertly  
A common tactic bullies use is insisting they don't care what you say, when really they do deeply care about getting a rise out of you. Call their bluff directly with a response like "If you didn't care, you wouldn't have bothered responding. But I get it, you do care—you care that nobody else does." Reversing their "I don't care" message in a clever way like this turns the tables on their attempt to get under your skin.
### Turning Request to "Go Away" Back on Them
When a pestering bully tells you to go away, don't oblige—turn it back around on them with something like "I would, but it seems like your parents already did that since they had to deal with your awful attitude every day." This implies they are disliked and potentially adopted in a witty way that subs their bullying attempt and allows you to keep playing unaffected. 
### Responding Calmly Yet Assertively  
Sometimes bullies just want any reaction from their targets, so the best approach is to respond very calmly and confidently without letting their insults seem to faze you at all. If they cry "Why are you listening?" simply reply factually, "Because I have ears, obviously" or point out they chose to interact in a public space. Staying cool-headed and logical can diffuse their attempts at a reaction far better than any insult could.
### Knowing When to Walk Away
While quick verbal jabs can be satisfying, remember that the goal is to end the bullying interaction—not escalate it. So if comeback attempts don't make the person stop, don't continue engaging. You've made your point, so just inform them calmly that you're going to resume enjoying your game now without them. Walking away confidently with your head held high is often the most effective way to truly shutdown a bully's power over you.
