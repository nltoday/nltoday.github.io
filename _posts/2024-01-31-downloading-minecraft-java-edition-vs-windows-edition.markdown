###Internet Speed and Download Time
As with any large game download, the time it takes to download Minecraft will depend greatly on your internet connection speed. A 500MB zip file download could take around 20 minutes on a standard home internet connection. **Minecraft Java edition** itself is around 500MB in size, while separate resource packs and mod downloads may range from 10MB to 200MB each. Faster fiber internet connections could see game downloads complete in under 10 minutes, while slower speeds like EDGE cellular may take an hour or more. 
###Making an Informed Choice
When choosing between **Minecraft Java edition** and **Windows 10 Bedrock edition,** there are some important factors to consider. While Windows edition can be played on multiple platforms including Xbox, Switch, iOS and Android, Java edition is compatible with both Windows and Mac computers natively. Java edition also has a huge community of players, resource packs, mods, servers and tutorials due to its longer history and open nature. Windows edition currently lacks mod support and all community content must come through the official marketplaces.
###The Power of Mods
No discussion of **Minecraft Java edition** would be complete without mentioning its thriving modding scene. With over 30,000 available mods on sites like CurseForge, players can drastically change the game experience. Mods allow you to add advanced redstone circuits, custom weapons, building blocks, vehicles, dimensions, bosses, farming, automation and much more. Windows edition may catch up eventually, but for a highly customized game **Java edition** is unparalleled in its customization potential through mods.
###Which is Best for Building?  
While both editions allow spectacular building and construction, Java editionAgain has a slight edge thanks to its wider range of available **building block mods.** Titles like Chisel & Bits, Decocraft, Better Builders Wands, Worldedit and Voxel Sniper give Java edition players more tools and materials to sculpt their builds. Command blocks also enable more advanced builds, farms and traps. However, both editions can result in amazing builds, so this comes down to personal preference more than a clear advantage.
###Comparing Redstone Logic
A key area **Minecraft Java edition** differs from Windows edition is in its redstone circuitry and logic systems. The programming-like Redstone in Java edition behaves in predictable, debuggable ways. Conversely glitches occasionally occur in Windows edition circuits due to non-deterministic behavior. For advanced Redstone contraptions like clocks, calculators and other complex devices, Java edition has a dependability advantage. Simple circuits generally work fine cross-platform, but for pushing Redstone to its limits Java edition is more suited. 
###Other Considerations
Beyond mods, building and Redstone differences, there are a few other minor factors to weigh. Java edition runs slightly better on lower-end computers versus Windows 10. Having server files makes it easy to locally host Java edition for LAN games too. Both games receive equal content updates, though Java may get some features earlier in development cycle. Overall support also tends to focus more on Java due to its history and community size. However, both are actively developed.
###The Best Edition is the One You Enjoy Most!
In the end, both Minecraft Java edition and Windows 10 Bedrock edition are exceptional games that many thousands enjoy daily. While Java edition has advantages in mod support, building options and Redstone control, Windows edition provides wider platform access. If only choosing one, factors like your computer, preferred gameplay style and interests in modding or specific versions will guide the best choice. But many play both editions happily depending on device or mood. Overall the "best" comes down to personal preference - choose the one letting you be the most creative!
