### Preparation Methodology
I started preparing for SSC CGL from January 2016. During the initial months, I focused on solving previous year question papers and reading newspapers daily, especially The Hindu. This helped me evaluate my strengths and weaknesses while also improving my general knowledge. 
In July 2016, I joined a reputed coaching institute to enhance my exam preparation for SSC CGL 2017. **The classroom training covered the exam pattern, difficulty level, and topic-wise test series to assess progress.** However, I continued self-study of previous papers and newspapers in parallel.

### Tier 1 Experience
My Tier 1 exam was scheduled for 27th August 2016. But due to some technical issues, SSC decided to conduct a re-exam on 27th October 2016. This gave me time to re-focus on areas requiring more practice. I scored 155.5 marks in the re-exam and cleared the preliminary round.
### Intense Tier 2 Preparation 
From 12th November onwards, I stopped attending coaching and devoted myself entirely to self-study. The period leading up to 30th November was very challenging as I didn't have sufficient time for exhaustive [Mathematics practice](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/dog-father). On exam day, my math skills fell short of expectations. However, I was determined to maximize my score through other sections.
### Excelling in English 
After the math paper, I was disappointed but not deterred. I regained focus for the English section, drawing inspiration from my pre-exam meal. My dedicated preparation stood me in good stead. I scored 161.25 marks, putting me in contention for the final phase.
### Comprehensive Tier 3 Planning
To score above 80 marks required for interview selection, I adopted a well-rounded approach. I wrote a daily diary, researched prominent schemes, and closely followed policy debates. This enriched my conceptual understanding and expression abilities.
### Striking Success 
On exam day, I responded to questions creatively backed by in-depth knowledge. Confident of scoring above 80, I now aim to achieve full marks in Maths for CGL 2017. Perseverance, dedication and acceptance of challenges were key to my first-time success. Preparation quality matters more than number of attempts.
### Key Takeaways
Focusingattention and effort exclusively on one exam at a time is advisable. Regular mock tests are indispensable for self-evaluation and tracking progress in weak areas. Not having prior attempts takes the pressure off, allowing you to give your absolute best. With the right method and mindset, CGL can be cleared in a single attempt through self-study.
### Reaping Rewards of Hard Work
My consistent preparation finally paid off. I scored 454.25 marks cumulatively across tiers to make the final merit list. In tier 3, my essay writing skills were appreciated with 80.5 marks. I am now serving as an Income Tax Inspector after being selected for the prestigious government job in my first CGL attempt itself. Thorough, targeted preparation is the key to success.
