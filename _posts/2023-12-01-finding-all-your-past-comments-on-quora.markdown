## A Comprehensive Guide
Quora is a great platform for asking questions, getting answers, and sharing knowledge. However, with the massive volume of content published each day, it can be difficult to keep track of everything you've contributed. In this guide, we'll explore different methods for finding all of your past comments on Quora.
### Browsing Your Edits Page 
The first place to look is your profile's edits page. This page lists all of your contributions to Quora, including **questions asked, answers provided, and comments added**. To access it:
1. Click on your profile picture in the top right 
2. Select "Profile"
3. Under "Feeds" on the left sidebar, click "Edits"
You'll now see a reverse chronological list of all your edits. Unfortunately, it doesn't allow filtering or searching. Scrolling through can be time consuming if you've been active for a long time.

### Leveraging Browser Search Tools
If accessing Quora from a desktop or laptop browser, you can enhance the edits page search with browser tools: 
1. Follow steps 1-3 above to access your edits page
2. Press CTRL+F (Windows) or CMD+F (Mac) to open the browser search bar   
3. Type "Comment added" to find all comment edits
4. Use the up/down arrows to navigate between matches
This makes it much easier to focus on just your comments instead of scrolling endlessly. However, mobile browsers may not support the same keyboard shortcuts.
### Investigating Other Profile Sections
Your profile has additional sections beyond just edits that could contain comments:
### Questions You've Commented On
This section lists any questions you've left comments on. It won't include comments on answers or standalone comments.
### Answers You've Commented On  
Like the above, this only covers comments left on other people's answers, not other types of comments.
Between these two sections and your overall edits page, you should be able to find the majority of your comments. But some may still be missing.
### Searching comment Text
For a truly complete list, you'll need to directly search the text of your comments. Quora does not currently provide an internal comment search. But with some effort, you can manually construct searches to find missed comments.
### Downloading Your Data 
The ultimate solution is downloading your entire Quora data. Within your profile settings, you can request a ZIP file containing all your Quora activity, including all comments in plain text. Then use your computer's builtin search to find any comment text. 
This process requires some technical expertise but ensures a complete record independent of Quora's internal systems. For infrequent commenting, the other methods may suffice. But for very active users, data download is recommended.
## Putting It All Together
To find all your past Quora comments, a multistep process is typically required:
1. Check your edits page with browser search tools 
2. Review the "Questions/Answers You've Commented On" sections
3. Consider direct searching of top comment texts
4. Download your full Quora data for a definitive search
With persistence and the right combination of in-app and external tools, you should be able to construct a complete history of every comment posted to Quora. Let me know if any part of the process remains unclear!
