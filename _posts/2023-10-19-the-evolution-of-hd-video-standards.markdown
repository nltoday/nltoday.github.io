### The Origins of HD Formats 
Japan pioneered early high definition formats in the 1960s with experimental broadcasts of 1035i. This standard provided much higher image quality compared to existing NTSC broadcasts. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, NHK continued developing and broadcasting 1035i tests to evaluate the technology. Meanwhile, European broadcasters explored using 1152i as a potential HD standard. 
As computer display resolutions advanced in the late 1980s, manufacturers like [SGI](https://store.fi.io.vn/funny-boxer-dog-lover-47-boxer-dog) began shipping systems with **1024x768** and **1280x1024** monitors capable of **real-time HD video playback**. Many technology demonstrations were created at these early HD resolutions and shown internationally. **960 lines** also gained popularity as a simple doubling of NTSC's 480 lines standard. By the early 1990s, **1080 lines** emerged as the target resolution worldwide broadcasters aimed to adopt.

### The Arrival of 720p and 1080i 
The **Zenith corporation patented a 720p HD format** as early as 1988 with 787.5 scan lines per frame and 720 active video lines. Though never standardized, it represented one of the first proposed HD resolutions. In the early 1990s, standards bodies agreed on **1080i** as the preferred interlaced format while **720p** also gained traction for high-end production and playback. 
Both **1080i** and **720p provided similar pixel rates** around 60 million pixels per second, with **1080i at 62.2 million** and **720p at 55.3 million**. Their ratio of 9:8 meant very similar information throughput. However, **1080p required double the pixels** of 1080i for the same frame rate, posing challenges for early broadcast infrastructure to adopt.
### Establishing HD as the Standard 
By 2004, satellite providers began broadcasting terrestrial TV channels in **native 1080i and 1080p formats** via DVB-S, demonstrating HD's readiness for mass adoption. Computer graphics workstations from the 1980s onward prepared the industry by popularizing early **HD resolutions like 1024x768 and 1280x1024** in technology demonstrations. 
YouTube added support for **720p in December 2008** followed by **1080p in November 2009**, reflecting HD's growing availability online. Meanwhile, **Korean broadcaster SBS began 1080i broadcasts in 2000** as one of the world's first terrestrial HD networks. By the late 2000s, **Blu-ray successfully standardized 1080p** as the HD home video format.
### Legacy Displays Transition to HD  
Though **full HD 1080p TVs first launched in 2007**, standards like **480p** also gained traction to transition legacy displays. In fact, the first widely available **480p broadcasts and TVs only emerged in 1997**. Before then, most content originated on lower-resolution equipment and had to be upscaled for newer HD displays.
Early HD pioneers like **NHK experimented with 1035i as far back as the 1960s**. But it took continuous technology improvements and cooperation between industries to establish **1080i and later 1080p** as the unified HD standards by the early 2000s. Today, **4K and 8K continue advancing display capabilities** to even higher resolutions.
