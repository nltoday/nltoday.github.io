### The Accidental Discovery
Hans Christian Ørsted, a Danish physicist and chemist, was giving a lecture at the University of Copenhagen on 21 April 1820. During the lecture, he decided to demonstrate to his students that electricity and magnetism were unrelated phenomena. As part of the demonstration, Ørsted connected a battery to a wire leading to an electric coil nearby a compass. To his surprise, he noticed the compass needle [deflected from magnetic north](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/alan) when the current from the battery was switched on and off. This unexpected observation showed that there was in fact a **direct relationship between electricity and magnetism**. What Ørsted discovered that day would shake the scientific world.

### Early Investigations and Recognition
In the months following his accidental discovery, Ørsted began more intensive investigations into the interaction between electricity and magnetism. Through careful experiments, he determined that the magnetic field created by an electric current formed **circular lines of magnetic flux** around the wire. Ørsted published a paper in July 1820 outlining his findings. For his groundbreaking work, the Royal Society of London awarded Ørsted the prestigious Copley Medal in 1820. That same year, the French Academy also recognized the significance of his discovery by granting him a generous prize of 3,000 francs. Ørsted's discovery stimulated immense interest and further research among scientists into the newly discovered field of **electrodynamics**.
### Ampère's Mathematical Modeling of the Phenomenon  
One scientist whose work was heavily influenced by Ørsted's discovery was the French physicist André-Marie Ampère. In the 1820s, Ampère conducted his own experiments to better understand the relationship between electricity and magnetism. Through meticulous measurements and mathematical analysis, Ampère was able to develop the earliest **quantitative theory of electromagnetism**. His work established the first successful mathematical formula to represent the magnetic forces exerted between current-carrying conductors. Ampère's equations elegantly described both Ørsted's original observation and Ampère's subsequent findings. Ampère's formulations marked a major step forward in representing electromagnetic phenomena through mathematical laws.
### Faraday's Pioneering Experiments in Electromagnetic Induction
In the 1830s, the renowned English scientist Michael Faraday carried out his own extensive experiments building on Ørsted and Ampère's work. Faraday made the epochal discovery of **electromagnetic induction** at the Royal Institution in London in 1831. Through demonstrations with coils of wire and magnets, he established that a changing magnetic field could induce, or generate, an electric current in a nearby conductor. Faraday's experiments firmly proved that a changing magnetic field creates an electric field, and vice versa. This insight formed the basis of transforming between electrical and magnetic energy, leading to today's technologies of electromechanical devices and electric power generation. Faraday was also the first to construct **practical electric motors** and generators based on electromagnetic induction.
### Establishing a Unified Theory of Electricity and Magnetism  
In the mid-19th century, James Clerk Maxwell synthesized the work of Ørsted, Ampère, Faraday and others into a coherent theoretical framework of electromagnetism. Maxwell compiled the existing empirical facts about electricity, magnetism and light into a set of differential equations. His landmark 1861 paper, 'On Physical Lines of Force', proposed that electric and magnetic fields travel and propagated as **electromagnetic waves** in space and time. With Maxwell's **Equations of Electromagnetism**, he established the first consistent theory that unified electricity, magnetism and light as different manifestations of the same electromagnetic phenomenon. Maxwell's equations revolutionized our understanding of electrodynamics and formed the classical basis of modern field theories in physics.
### The Oersted Unit for Magnetic Field Strength
In recognition of Ørsted's pioneering discovery of the magnetic effects of electric currents, the oersted (symbol Oe) was adopted as the unit of measurement for magnetic field intensity in the centimetre–gram–second system of units. One oersted is defined as the required magnetic field strength to produce a force of one dyne on a straight wire of length one centimeter carrying a current of one abampere. Although the oersted is rarely used today in SI units, it serves as a testament to Ørsted's historical importance in discovering the fundamental relationship that underpins myriad technologies relying on electromagnetism.
### Impact and Legacy of Finding the Electric-Magnetic Connection
The serendipitous observation by Ørsted on that fateful day in 1820 had immense and far-reaching consequences. It provided irrefutable experimental evidence that electricity and magnetism were two **interconnected aspects of a single electromagnetic phenomenon**. This established the basis for myriad later technologies capitalizing on this principle such as electromechanical devices, electric motors, generators and transformers. Ørsted's discovery also stimulated the vital research programs of Ampère, Faraday, and Maxwell that led to our modern theoretical understanding of electromagnetism. Their combined work represented a pivotal turning point in our comprehension of fundamental energy interactions in nature. Even today, **electric and magnetic technologies** remain at the heart of industry, transportation, communication and innovations shaping our 21st century world.
### A Turning Point for Unified Theories in Physics  
Ørsted's serendipitous accident ranks as one of the most important happenings in the history of physics. By demonstrating the intimate connection between two phenomena previously believed distinct, it demonstrated the critical importance of seeking **unified theories** to depict nature. The significance of Ørsted's discovery was in establishing the possibility and necessity for a field concept able to represent such interactions. By pulling together disparate knowledge into a coherent framework according to natural law, pioneers like Ampère and Maxwell took us closer to a grand unified theory of all forces. Though forces have continued dividing as our understanding progressed, the effort to integrate them remains the driving purpose and challenge for theoretical physics. Thus Ørsted's simple demonstration began a revolution whose implications continue shaping our ever more potent yet elusive grasp of reality's hidden workings.
