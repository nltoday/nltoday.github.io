## Why AKTU Introduced a Standardized Roll Number System
With over 300 affiliated colleges across Uttar Pradesh, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University (AKTU) had over 500,000 enrolled students as of 2020. Managing such large student data and records was becoming a challenge. 
### The Need for a Unique Identifier 
To efficiently organize student information and track their academic progress, AKTU realized the need for introducing a universal [roll number system](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/aldinger). A standardized format would allow unique identification of each student with their **personal details, college, branch and admission year** encoded in their roll number.

## Evolution of the AKTU Roll Number Over Time
### From 10 to 13 Digits 
Until 2018, AKTU roll numbers followed a **10-digit format**. It included admission year, college code, branch code and student sequence number. 
From 2019 onwards, AKTU upgraded to a **13-digit roll number system** with additional digits added for college code and sequence number. This increased the scope to uniquely identify more students as enrollments continued growing rapidly.
### Decoding the roll Number

- 19 = Admission year (2019)
- 1234 = College code 
- 567 = Branch code (Computer Science)  
- 8911 = Sequence number
## Locating Your College and Branch Codes
To fully decode your roll number, you need to refer to the official lists of **college codes and branch codes** maintained on the AKTU website.
### College Codes
