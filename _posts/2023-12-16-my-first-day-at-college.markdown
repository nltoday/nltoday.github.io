### Nerves and Excitement  
I remembered the nerves and excitement I felt in the weeks leading up to my first day at college. From preparing my bag and outfit to barely sleeping the night before due to anxiety, the anticipation was building. While excited for this new journey, I worried about fitting in and managing responsibilities on my own. 
On the morning of **January 5th, 2021**, I woke up even earlier than usual, my mind racing as I got ready. The 10-minute bus ride seemed to fly by in a blur. When I arrived on campus, I took a deep breath and enjoyed a moment to soak it all in. My nerves suddenly disappeared, replaced by relief and happiness.

### New Faces and Experiences
I was thrilled to see my friends at college and we laughed while taking pictures together. Our excitement to start this new chapter was clear. My first class went well, though I felt out of place not knowing about [advanced multivariable calculus concepts](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/adkisson). Luckily, I met someone friendly in my physics class who invited me to have lunch. 
To my surprise, she seemed like a normal person despite knowing about concepts like **special relativity**. We had a good time with another classmate who also felt lost. It reassured me to know I wasn't alone in feeling overwhelmed on the first day. My journalism class intimidated me with upperclassmen, but I later impressed my professor with my writing.
### Finding My Way 
After class ended, I had some downtime in my dorm that only heightened my loneliness. A guy from my floor broke the silence by asking if everyone was really studying already on the first day. It reinforced how behind I thought I was. 
Later, some friends invited me out for bubble tea. We debated topics like **philosophy, politics, and agriculture** deep into the night. While tired, I felt happy to connect with others. Our exploration of campus under the stars was fun, even if we didn't climb every tree like planned. It gave me hope of fitting in.
### Adjusting and Growing  
Looking back, that first day showed me both the challenges and rewards of college. While problem sets still take hours, I'm friends with my physics classmates now. My journalism writing earned praise, and I found my textbook store. I learned to study without overwhelm and to enjoy solo and social activities alike.
Nearly a year later, I'm still feeling my way but finding my place. I'm excited to see how this college journey unfolds and who I become through these experiences. The nerves of starting anew will always be there, but so will the people and lessons that make it worthwhile.
