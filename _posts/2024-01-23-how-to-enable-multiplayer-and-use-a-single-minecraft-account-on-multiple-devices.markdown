### Understanding the Issue
When trying to access the multiplayer feature in [Minecraft Java Edition](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-holiday-funny-santa-shetland-sheepdog-christmas-tree-2), you may see a message saying that multiplayer is disabled. This occurs because the game uses your Microsoft account profile settings to determine if multiplayer is allowed. By default, these settings are restrictive to prevent unwanted online access. However, with some changes we can configure it to enable local multiplayer use with one purchased account across different devices.

### Preparing the Host File
The first step is to edit the host file so the Minecraft launcher cannot automatically update the username files. Open the host file located at `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` in Notepad. Copy the original file to the desktop for backup, then add `127.0.0.1 minecraft.net` and `0.0.0.0 minecraft.net` to block internet access. This prevents the launcher from synchronizing usernames online. Save and replace the original file.
### Editing the Minecraft Profile
Next, we modify the profile configuration to alter the displayed username. Navigate to `C:\Users\[Your Username]\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft` and open the `launcher_profiles.json` file. Change the displayName value to the new profile name, then save and close. Launch Minecraft to check if the username updated correctly at the bottom right. Repeat this step until the name changes.
### Configuring Privacy Settings  
Sign in to your Microsoft account at `https://account.xbox.com/Settings/Home/` and select Privacy & Online Safety from the left menu. Choose the profile linked to your Minecraft purchase and scroll down to the "You can join multiplayer games" option. Select "Allow" and confirm by clicking the Submit button below. Restart Minecraft to apply the changes.
### Testing Multiplayer Access
With the profile and privacy settings updated, multiplayer should now be functional on the initial device. Complete the same host file and profile editing process on other devices you want to use locally. As long as the account remains signed in, each system can now access shared worlds and mini-games together through LAN connectivity. Just ensure all devices are on the same network.
### Playing Together Securely 
While this allows multiplayer use across multiple platforms with one paid copy of the game, there are limitations. Features like custom skins are only possible through modding individual devices. Most importantly, connecting to public servers requires purchasing extra accounts due to licensing restrictions. Still, for casual local-network play between family members or roommates, this single-purchase multiplayer method works well. Just maintain security and sign out fully when finished to avoid profile hijacking online.
### Troubleshooting Connection Issues
If local games still do not see other players after configuring everything correctly, double check the network and firewall settings. Minecraft uses unique ports to initiate connections between instances. Ensure these are open and not being blocked accidentally. You can also try restarting routers briefly to clear any lingering filters. As a last resort, completely uninstalling and reinstalling Java may fix profile corruption issues preventing peers from joining. With some testing, typical connection problems can usually be identified and addressed.
### Continuing the Minecraft Experience  
By taking the time to edit these profile and privacy controls, families and friend groups gain far more value from their purchase of Minecraft. Whether exploring randomly generated worlds together or competing in minigames, the shared experience of multiplayer deepens friendship bonds and creates positive memories. Even for solo players, opening local access adds new dimensions to how this beloved sandbox title can bring people together. Crafting, building, adventuring - the possibilities are endless when players unite on a LAN.
