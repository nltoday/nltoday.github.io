### Preparing for the Exams
With a small state like Tripura lacking reputed coaching centres, I had to rely on private tuitions which made managing my school curriculum very difficult. The one year of the Covid-19 pandemic that delayed exams provided some relief as all tuition classes moved online. However, excessive screen time also introduced new distractions like social media. With such a vast [NEET syllabus to complete within 2 years](https://store.fi.io.vn/play-well-with-others-otter-lover-animal-marine-biologist-1) of preparation, the pressure was immense. 
I started my hardcore NEET preparation only 2 months before the September 2022 exam after taking things relatively easy until then. Managing school, tuition and self-study all at once was very taxing. The level of **competition for medical college admission is also unimaginably high** with over 16 lakh students appearing for just 61,000 seats. Knowing these factors only added to the stress.

### My First Attempt
In NEET 2020, I scored 545 marks which was not good enough to get into a reputed medical college. I was disheartened but with the support of my loved ones, I chose to **take a drop year and try again**. Covid-19 disrupted regular classes but the shift online, while introducing new distractions, proved beneficial in some ways too. 
### Improving My Score
For NEET 2021, I increased my preparation intensity and focused more on **practising previous year question papers**. However, due to pandemic constraints, all practice could only be done virtually without offline testing. This impacted my ability to correctly manage time under exam pressure. Still, I improved my score to 569 marks and was relieved.
### Choosing the Right College
With an AIR of 1882, I had options like AIIMS Raipur, Patna and Nagpur. After careful consideration of location preference and infrastructure quality, I decided on SCB Medical College, Cuttack, **Odisha's top state-run medical institute**. Though uncertain then, a year spent here has proven it was the right call.
### Gaining Confidence as an Educator
The gap year proved fruitful not just for NEET preparation but also professionally. I joined Physics Wallah, India's leading educational technology company, as a Subject Matter Expert and taught online classes. Earning a stable income at a young age boosted my morale tremendously. 
### Receiving My Final Results   
By NEET 2022, I was well prepared through focused studying and online test series. I scored my highest - 625 marks with an AIR 10846. Elated to have cleared NEET on my third and final attempt, I am now set to begin my MBBS journey.
### Pursuing My Dream
Having endured the pressures and competition of NEET over three years, I feel accomplished to have secured admission into a medical programme. I look forward to making the most of this opportunity at SCB Medical College and fulfilling my aspiration of becoming a doctor. My message to all aspirants is to enjoy the learning process and perseveringly chase their goals.
