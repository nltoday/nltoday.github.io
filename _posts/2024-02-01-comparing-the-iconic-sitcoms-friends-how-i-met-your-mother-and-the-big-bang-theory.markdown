### [Star Cast and Character Development](https://yt.io.vn/collection/achenbach) 
All three shows had memorable star casts that played a key role in the success of each series. FRIENDS featured six main characters that were given equal screen time and importance throughout the entire 10 season run. Each character was iconic in their own right with their own backstories and fans. This is evident from the fact that during contract negotiations, all six main actors were paid equally. 
How I Met Your Mother also had strong character development in the early seasons. However, as the story progressed, the focus shifted more to just a few characters. While the backstories were well established, some characters seemed to fade into the background more than others. 
The Big Bang Theory featured some truly great performances, especially from Jim Parsons as Sheldon Cooper. However, the characters were not given equal importance or pay. During negotiations, only Jim Parsons, Johnny Galecki, and Kaley Cuoco received matching salaries while Kunal Nayyar and Simon Helberg were told their characters could be written out.

### **Memorable Ongoing Storylines**
FRIENDS told the story of six friends in their twenties living in New York City. It started with great promise and delivered for 10 seasons before ending perfectly. The audience was kept intrigued throughout by ongoing story arcs like Ross and Rachel's will they/won't they relationship. 
How I Met Your Mother similarly captured fans with its engaging multi-season mystery of how Ted Mosby would finally meet the mother of his children. However, it struggled to maintain this magic in later seasons and disappointed many with its controversial series finale.
While The Big Bang Theory featured ongoing stories about the characters' personal lives, its real strength was in its unique humorous takes on geek culture and STEM topics delivered through the misadventures of Sheldon, Leonard, and their friends.
### **Endless Laugh Out Loud Moments**  
All three shows achieved great success based on their ability to consistently make audiences laugh. FRIENDS featured laugh out loud comedy in nearly every scene through its witty dialogue, exaggerations of personality types, and hilarious running gags.
How I Met Your Mother was incredibly funny as well, especially thanks to Neil Patrick Harris' over-the-top antics as Barney Stinson. However, it sometimes pushed the envelope more with risqu√© jokes about sex and nudity.
The Big Bang Theory showcased gut-busting hilarity through its #nerdculture references and spotlight on socially awkward scientist characters. The comedy was smart and heartwarming without needing crude language or content.
### **Clean Family Friendly Humor**
While pushing boundaries can generate laughs, FRIENDS carved out its massive legacy primarily through its #clean comedy. It refused to compromise its family friendly tone despite opportunities for edgier content. Subtle jokes and innuendo still hit their marks.
In contrast, much of How I Met Your Mother's humor was centered around crass sexual references and scenarios involving genitalia or promiscuity that gave it a more adult orientation. This style limited its potential repeat viewership.  
Like FRIENDS, The Big Bang Theory found huge mainstream success by keeping its content G or PG rated. Its nerdy humor relied on intellect over crude language to generate laughs from all ages.
### **Timelessness and Enduring Re-Watch Value**
FRIENDS has proven to be the gift that keeps on giving through countless reruns and streaming viewings even over 25 years after its finale. Its mix of relatable characters and#universal human experiences ensure it remains just as fresh and re-watchable today.
How I Met Your Mother was undeniably funny for many, but its more niche and at times racy style of humor has not aged as well. Most fans tend to give it only one or two full re-watches. 
With The Big Bang Theory still recently concluded, it remains to be seen if its mix of heart and hilarity will captivate audiences as strongly in repeat viewings years from now as FRIENDS has. Based on its family friendly tone, chances are good it will have solid longevity.
### **Cultural Phenomenon and Global Impact**  
Through a sustained decade on the air, FRIENDS permeated the zeitgeist in a way few other TV shows ever have. Iconic catchphrases and references are still widely quoted and understood across borders by people of all ages worldwide. 
How I Met Your Mother gained a passionate cult following during its nine season run. However, it never quite reached the same mainstream phenomenon status or leaving a mark on the global pop culture conversation like FRIENDS.
While The Big Bang Theory achieved immense commercial success in its 12 seasons, it is still too soon to judge if its influence and fanbase will stretch as widely and endure as strongly internationally  as the timeless FRIENDS.
### **Lasting Legacy and Continued Appeal**
25 years after going off air, FRIENDS remains a staple among streaming services and in syndication on channels worldwide. Its new generations of fans have also driven box set sales and eventizing like reruns in theaters. The beloved characters live on.
How I Met Your Mother holds a special place for many, but being a more recent conclusion, it's still to be determined if fans will continue engaging with it so passionately years from now or if it will maintain such steady viewership. 
As the last live action multi-camera sitcom blockbuster, The Big Bang Theory leaves behind a great humor legacy. With a passionate fanbase, its characters may also enjoy new life in future projects if creators choose to revisit them. Only time will tell its true lasting impact.
### **Verdict: The One That Defined Them All**
While all achieved great success in their own right based on strong writing, casts and bringing smiles, only one broke the mold enough to become far more than just a hit TV show - it created a global cultural movement. That show was and will always be FRIENDS. It blended #relatability with hilarity in a way no other sitcom has matched before or since. For truly understanding the impact andbenchmark FRIENDS set as the #GOAT sitcom, it earns the top spot in any comparison against even these other highly worthy contenders.
