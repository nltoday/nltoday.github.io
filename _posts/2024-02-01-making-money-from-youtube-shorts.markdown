YouTube introduced Shorts back in 2020 and it has since become a major part of the YouTube experience and community. Shorts allow creators to make vertical videos up to 60 seconds in length and add features like music. In this article, we will explore how YouTube Shorts work and various ways creators can monetize and make money from their Shorts content.
### Understanding YouTube Shorts 
YouTube Shorts are short vertical videos that are 60 seconds or less in length. They were created by YouTube to compete with platforms like TikTok that were dominating the short form video space. With Shorts, users can record, edit clips together, add special effects and music to create entertaining short videos much like they would on TikTok. Some key things to note about Shorts include that they can only be uploaded from a mobile device in vertical format.

### YouTube Shorts Monetization Options
When YouTube first launched Shorts back in 2020, monetization options for creators were limited. However, in recent years YouTube has introduced several ways for creators to make money from their Shorts content. 
One of the primary ways is through the YouTube Shorts Fund. YouTube committed $100 million to reward creators for creating popular and engaging Shorts content. Creators who meet the eligibility requirements receive a share of the fund based on metrics like views and watch time on their Shorts.
YouTube is also testing integrated ads on Shorts. If a creator's channel is monetized, ads may begin displaying on popular Shorts in the future and they would earn a portion of the revenue. Additionally, YouTube continues to explore sponsorships and other forms of [integrated monetization](https://yt.io.vn/collection/alejos) within Shorts.

- Engaging with comments and responding to viewers to boost interaction.
- Cross-promoting Shorts content to other social platforms.
- Creating playlists or collections to keep viewers watching multiple Shorts.
With a dedicated following, creators open up more sponsorship and partnership opportunities beyond just YouTube monetization as well.

Some ways to do this include: 
- Teasing an upcoming video or project in a Short.
- Directing viewers to click the profile for more details.  
- Watermarking Shorts with your channel name and logo.
- Sharing intros or snippets from larger videos in Short format.
