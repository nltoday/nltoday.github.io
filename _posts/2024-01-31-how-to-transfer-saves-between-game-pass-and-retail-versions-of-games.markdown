### Understanding Save File Encryption 
Game developers encrypt save files so that they can only be read by the game's official software or platform. **This prevents tampering and ensures gameplay integrity across devices and platforms.** When playing a game through Xbox Game Pass, the save files are encrypted specifically for the Game Pass version of that game.

### Manually Transferring Saves is Difficult
While it may be theoretically possible to manually locate a game's save files on your device and transfer them between versions, this process is extremely complicated and risky. **Game files and formats change frequently through updates, making manual transfers unreliable over time.** Developers also change save file locations and encryption to prevent modifications, so finding and decrypting files requires specialized technical expertise.
### Save Transfers Require Matching Platform Versions 
For saves to be readable, the version you are transferring to must match the original version exactly. **Game and software updates can break compatibility, preventing your progress from carrying over.** While some first-party Xbox titles allow cross-platform saving between Game Pass and retail, this is at the developer's discretion and not guaranteed for all games.
### Cloud Saving Enables Easy Transfers for Supported Titles
Luckily, many titles now support cloud saving through your Xbox Live account. **By enabling cloud saving in the Game Pass version, your progress will be automatically accessible if you purchase the retail disc or digital version later.** No file tampering is required - your save simply loads from the cloud on the new version. However, not all developers implement cloud saving, so check game-by-game.
### Purchasing Retail Versions Unlocks Additional Benefits  
Besides retaining your save progress, buying a game you've played through Game Pass removes limitations like an expiration date. **You can continue playing indefinitely without needing an active subscription.** Plus, owning the full game often provides access to premium features and downloadable content packs not included with the basic Game Pass version.
### Weigh Subscription Perks Against Retail Ownership 
For many popular games played casually through Game Pass, the convenience of the subscription may outweigh eventual ownership benefits. **However, if you find yourself revisiting a game frequently or want access to all features long-term, purchasing the retail edition could be worthwhile down the road.** Carefully consider your gameplay habits and needs before deciding between rental and full purchase options.
### Summary
In summary, while manually transferring saves between Game Pass and retail versions is complicated, cloud saving functionality streamlines the process for supported titles. Weigh the pros and cons of subscriptions versus ownership based on your expected gameplay habits to decide the best option. With either approach, conveniently retaining progress is the priority over juggling encrypted local save files.
