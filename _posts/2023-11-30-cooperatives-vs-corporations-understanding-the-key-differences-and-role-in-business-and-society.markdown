## The defining characteristics
Cooperatives and corporations have distinguishing characteristics that define their nature and operations. [Cooperatives](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-crass-christmas-gnome-matching-family-ugly-v-neck-t-shirt/men&) are voluntary member-owned organizations focused on meeting member needs rather than profit maximization. Each member has equal say in decisions through a one-member one-vote principle. **Corporations** exist as separate legal entities where control depends on share ownership rather than membership. They are geared towards profit making and delivering returns to shareholders. 
### Cooperative structure and governance  
Cooperatives operate on democratic values with governance centered around the membership. All members have equal say in important matters through one-member one-vote principle irrespective of capital invested. The surplus generated is distributed among members in proportion to their use of services rather than shareholding.

### Corporate structure and governance
Corporations exist as legally independent entities with limited liability. Shareholders elect a board of directors to govern on their behalf and make key strategic decisions. Control depends on the number of shares owned giving shareholders multiple votes based on their investment. Profits are distributed as dividends to shareholders in proportion to their share of capital.
## Funding and surplus distribution
The way cooperatives and corporations are funded and distribute financial gains differs based on their divergent objectives. 
### Cooperative funding and surplus distribution
Cooperatives are funded through member subscriptions in the form of shares which are often small in value. The surplus or profit generated is ploughed back, distributed among members based on their use or reinvested in expanding services and facilities for members.
### Corporate funding and surplus distribution    
Corporations are funded through issuing shares to investors in exchange for capital. The main objective is to maximize profits which are distributed to shareholders as dividends based on their share of ownership in the company. Growth is catered to through retained earnings, new capital raises or taking loans.
## Purpose and role in the economy
While cooperatives and corporations serve different purposes, both play an important albeit distinct role in furthering economic and social progress.
### Purpose and role of cooperatives
Cooperatives exist to fulfill unmet needs of their membership through collective action. They notably empower communities by creating local jobs, addressing issues of access and monopolistic exploitation especially in agriculture, food and housing. 
### Purpose and role of corporations  
Corporations aim to deliver returns to shareholders through successful commercial ventures. They drive productivity, innovation and economic growth through large-scale standardized operations and risk capital. Jobs are also created along the value chain but control often lies externally.
## Sustainability and impact considerations
The longevity and broader impact of cooperatives and corporations vary due to differences in accountability and orientation.
### Sustainability of cooperatives
With deep local roots and democratic accountability, cooperatives often pursue long-term intergenerational success through sustained services to communities. Activities also have scope for positive spill over effects on livelihoods, food security and local development.
### Sustainability of corporations
While some corporations take a long-term view, the primary duty to shareholders can compel short-term gains at the cost of broader sustainability. Impacts are dependent on ethical practices and commitment to environmental/social responsibility beyond compliance. 
## Conclusion
Both cooperatives and corporations have vital yet distinct roles to play in a balanced economy. When guided by principles of fairness, partnership and long-term orientation, they can enhance economic participation and shared prosperity for communities. Policy support is needed to realize their potential through customized yet supportive regulatory frameworks.
