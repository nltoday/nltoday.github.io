## What You Need to Know About Street Fights
### Surviving by Any Means Necessary
Street fights are no joke - they are brutal, violent life-or-death struggles. Having survived 87 intense fights in streets, bars, and even jails, I can attest that street fighting does not involve "fooling around". These fights have no rules, and anything and everything can and will be used as a weapon. I haven't walked away from one without injuries - I've been shot, stabbed, clubbed, swarmed, kicked, and beaten. Only by God's grace am I still alive today. My body is full of screws, wires, plates, pins, and staples from my many injuries over the years.

### Experience Teaches Not to Win, But to Survive
You'll notice I never use the word "win" when referring to a fight. There are no winners, only survivors. I've always managed to walk or crawl away, though not without trauma to my body. Experience has taught me that fights are about survival, not victory. The goal is to end the threat and get away safely, by any means necessary. Saving face with clever moves takes a backseat to pure efficiency and effectiveness when your life is on the line.
### Wasting Effort Gets You Hurt
Pulling an opponent's shirt over their face in a fight wastes precious time and effort. At close range, it's better to immediately disable them through eye gouges or broken noses rather than play games. Fighting requires practicality - you must take care of business as directly as possible without frivolous maneuvers. Each moment wasted leaves an opening for your opponent to gain the upper hand.
### One Effective Shirt Technique: the Cross-Choke
While shirts themselves usually cannot aid in fighting, there is one technique that effectively uses shirt material as a weapon - the **cross-choke**. Bunching the shirt forms a rope-like structure that can cut off blood and oxygen when wrapped around the neck. This **juji-gatame chokehold** is demonstrated in the video starting at the one minute mark. It gets the job done efficiently without any wasted motions or unnecessary risks. Practicality is key to survival in a real fight.
### Advice from Hard-Earned Experience
## Strategies for Self-Defense 
### Analyzing Close-Range Shirt Tactics
In reply to the question of using a shirt in a fight, it's best to analyze such maneuvers based on practical experience. While pulling a shirt over someone's face may seem clever, up close it presents opportunities for more efficient disabling strikes. Eyegouges and broken noses at biting range effectively ruin vision and breathing with less wasted effort. Self-defense requires taking the most direct path to end threats.
### Experience is the Best Teacher 
With 87 intense fights under my belt across various contexts, I've learned lessons the hard way. None were jokes - they were brutal, traumatic struggles for survival. Only by God's grace have I walked or crawled away each time with my life, despite injuries like bullet wounds, stab wounds, and broken bones. This experience gives me authority to advise on what truly works to survive a street fight. Practicality over clever tricks could mean the difference between living or not. 
### Stick to Tried-and-True Methods
When your well-being is at risk, there is no time for theatrical fighting strategies. **Tested self-defense techniques[ like eye gouges and ](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-dad5478-t-shirt)breaks focus on efficiency** over flashy pantomimes. As demonstrated in the video, even using a shirt effectively requires forming it into a weapon like structure for a chokehold. But above all, the best moves get the threat stopped immediately without wasted efforts. My advice comes from lessons learned in the harshest of realities.
### Stay Focused on the Goal
In a true fight, the only thing that matters is walking away alive. "Winning" holds no meaning in that scenario. Every action must contribute directly to neutralizing the opponent and exiting the conflict. Fooling around with improvised tactics runs the risks of injury when proven options exist. My experiences have taught me that fighting smart means keeping one's composure and sticking to what is known to work for survival's sake above all else.
## In Summary
Street fights are intensely dangerous situations that require taking them seriously for the life-threatening realities they pose. From many such encounters over the years, I've gained valuable perspective on what tactics truly serve the singular goal of survival when your life is on the line. Practicality, efficiency, and avoidance of wasted efforts serve one best in a fight, as silly techniques can end up hurting your chances. My advice comes from hard-earned lessons - keep focused on disabling threats and ending dangers, not clever antics, in any real fight. Your life may depend on it.
