Windows is the world's most widely used operating system. Knowing which exact version of Windows you are running is important for many reasons like checking system requirements, updating drivers, troubleshooting issues, and more. Here are some simple methods to quickly find your Windows version:
### Checking the Version in About This PC 
The easiest and quickest way to know your Windows version is by accessing the "About" section in "This PC" or "My Computer". 
When you open "This PC" or "My Computer", you will see the edition name like [Windows 10 Home](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/abrahams) or **Windows 7 Professional** right at the top. This tells you the edition as well as the major version of Windows you are running in a single glance. 
Additionally, you get details like your device name, installed memory, storage space and more details one click away without needing to note down or search for anything else. The "About" section provides a consolidated one-stop view of your system details including the exact Windows version.

### Using the Windows Key + Pause Break Keyboard Shortcut
Another simple method is by using a keyboard shortcut. Press the **Windows logo key** and **Pause/Break key** simultaneously on your keyboard. 
This will open the **System** window providing details like your device name, registered owner name, system type whether it's 32-bit or 64-bit, installed memory, version and edition of Windows. Specifically, the "Version" field clearly mentions the exact version like "Windows 10 Home" or "Windows 7 Professional" etc. 
The System window shows a more expanded set of system properties compared to just the "About" section in "This PC". This keyboard shortcut provides an easy to access properties dialogue right from your keyboard without using the mouse.
### Checking Version with Windows Key + R Run Dialog
An alternate is to use the Run dialog box to check Windows version details. Press **Windows logo key + R keys** to bring up the Run dialog box. 
Type "winver" (without quotes) in the Open text box and press Enter. The Windows version window will pop-up showing details like installed version, edition, type of system and more in a single screen. 
This "winver" command is a quick and direct way to see the full Windows version details on screen without needing to navigate folders or search for settings. The output is similar to what you see in the System window accessed using Windows key + Pause/Break keyboard shortcut.
### Using Windows Settings App 
In recent versions of Windows 10, you can also check the version from the Settings app. Open the Settings app from the Start menu and select "System" from the left sidebar.
Under the heading "Device specifications", you will find the details like **Windows specifications**, **Installed on date** and most importantly the **Windows edition** and **Version** clearly mentioned. 
The Settings app provides an overview of key device settings and specs consolidated in one organized place. Though not as direct as the previous keyboard shortcut methods, it is still a simple way within the intuitive Windows interface to check your exact Windows version.
### Checking File Properties for Windows Version Number 
If you want to find just the numeric version number, you can check the properties of certain system files that always indicate the specific Windows version number.
Open File Explorer and right-click on the "This PC" or "Local Disk (C:)" location. Select "Properties" and navigate to the "Details" tab. Here you can find the exact Windows version number like 6.1, 10.0 etc. listed under "Windows version".
Additionally, you can right-click the Windows folder usually located at C:\Windows and check the properties of files likeWindowsExplorer.exe, SysWOW64 among others that also display the numeric version within their "Details" section. This provides a programmatic view of the version for technical documentation purposes.
### Verifying Version in Control Panel Programs
The older control panel method also works if the above mentioned methods don't clearly show the version for some reason. 
Go to Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Features. Check under "Windows" and it will accurately state the installed Windows version whether it's Windows 10, 8.1, 7 etc.
While not as quick as the keyboard shortcuts, this provides a consistent backup option to validate the exact Windows version through the traditional Windows interface for troubleshooting or documentation needs.
