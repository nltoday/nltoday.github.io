A general overview of the theory behind Riemann and Darboux integrals, including their definitions, relationship to each other, and some key properties. 
### Rectangular Approximations
Both Riemann and Darboux integrals are based on approximating the area under a curve using rectangles. Given a function **f(x)[ defined over an interval ](https://store.fi.io.vn/cinco-de-mayo-cinco-de-mayo-shirt-chihuaha-chihuaha-shirt-funny-chihuahua-funny-chihuahua-shirt4345-t-shirt)[a,b]**, we partition the interval into smaller subintervals and construct rectangles on each one. The areas of these rectangles provide estimates of the true area under the curve of **f(x)**.

### Darboux Integrals
For each subinterval in a partition **P**, Darboux integrals use the minimum and maximum values of **f(x)** to construct a lower and upper rectangle. Taking the sums of these gives lower and upper **Darboux rectangular estimates**. If the greatest lower bound of upper estimates equals the least upper bound of lower estimates, the value is the **Darboux integral**.
### Riemann Integrals 
Riemann integrals use a single rectangle on each subinterval with height determined by **f(x)** at some interior point. This **Riemann rectangular estimate** lies between the Darboux bounds. To define the integral, we take the limit as the partition's maximum length approaches zero. If this limit exists, the function is **Riemann integrable**.
### Equivalence and Relationship
A function is Darboux integrable on an interval if and only if it is Riemann integrable. Furthermore, when a function is integrable by either definition, the integral values are equal. While Darboux integrals may be easier to conceptualize, Riemann integrals allow for more general theorems.
### Applications of Integrals
Calculus integrals have wide applications in physics, engineering, and other sciences. For example, in thermodynamics the heat transferred in a process can be modeled as the integral of temperature over time. In kinematics, integrals connect velocity and acceleration to displacement. Many classical physics equations involve integrals.
### Numerical Integration Techniques 
When integrals cannot be evaluated analytically, numerical methods approximate the value. Common techniques include **left/right Riemann sums**, **trapezoidal rule**, and **Simpson's rule**. As the number of subintervals increases, the approximation converges to the true integral. Numerical integration is important for modeling real-world phenomena on computers.
### History and Development 
The integral concepts grew from ancient Greeks estimating areas bounded by curves. In the 19th century Bernhard Riemann and Jean-Charles Darboux independently developed the modern definitions that form the foundation of calculus instruction today. Their work helped establish analysis as a rigorous field and revealed integrals' deep mathematical structure.
