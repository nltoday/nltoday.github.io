### # Is TLauncher Really Spyware? 
There have been many claims that TLauncher contains spyware and collects user data without consent. [Original TLauncher developer](https://store.fi.io.vn/west-coast-rappers-hip-hop-hood-security-fashion-rottweiler-1) notes that the current owners of TLauncher appropriated the name from his original project. They also engaged in suspicious behavior like modifying browser settings on users' devices to redirect traffic to their website. If you log into your Mojang account through TLauncher, your account credentials could be exposed. One Reddit user reported **losing their paid Minecraft account** after logging in through TLauncher. Clearly, there are privacy and security risks to using this launcher.

### # A History of Deceptive and Underhanded Practices
TLauncher's owners have shown they are willing to engage in unethical behavior to promote their version of the launcher. They trademarked the "TLauncher" name in order to issue DMCA takedowns against websites hosting the original project. The owners also allegedly took control of the **original TLauncher community group** on VKontakte, only to start displaying inappropriate ads. This was likely an attempt to damage the reputation of the genuine launcher. They continue censoring any online discussions that shed negative light on their project or promote alternatives. 
### # Questionable Monetization and Server Practices
Reports indicate TLauncher inserts its own ads and skin replacements, overriding user-selected options. There are also **short-lived sponsored servers** aimed at extracting money from young players via purchases. However, these servers disappear just weeks later, refusing refunds. Meanwhile, legitimate servers that decline advertising deals face **restrictions in TLauncher**. Overall, it seems monetization and server partnerships are prioritized over the best interests of players.
### # Piracy With Hidden Perils
While piracy provides free access for those unable to pay, **Notch himself acknowledged** the merits of trying a game before buying. However, with TLauncher there are unseen malware risks. Big companies like Microsoft won't ignore pirated versions that affect their revenue. Rather than face potential copyright issues, consider safer free alternatives or wait until having funds to purchase officially. Your computer security and private data are not worth compromising.
### # Alternatives Worth Exploring 
A better free option is **TL Legacy launcher**, the original project TLauncher wrongly took credit from. As the developer's intent, it only aims to launch Minecraft without unnecessary modifications. **MultiMC** is also a well-regarded open-source launcher free of advertisements or suspicious activities. For those needing a paid account, look for special promotions or consider **Minecraft's subscription options** providing regular access at a lower monthly price than buying individually. With a little patience and research, you can enjoy Minecraft safely and support its continued development.
### # In Summary
While the desire to access Minecraft without cost is understandable, TLauncher comes with hidden risks that aren't worth compromising your online safety and privacy. Major red flags include appropriating others' work, censoring criticism, and a lack of transparency about data practices. Spending a little time investigating superior free and paid alternatives is safer than using a service with such a problematic history. Your well-being should take priority over momentary conveniences - so consider options that don't jeopardize your digital wellness or support malicious business models. Minecraft is best enjoyed through legitimate means.
