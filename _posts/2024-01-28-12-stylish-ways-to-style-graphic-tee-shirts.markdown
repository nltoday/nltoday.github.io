### Pair it with Jeans or Shorts and Sneakers
One of the easiest and most casual ways to style a graphic tee is by pairing it with some classic denim jeans or shorts along with a pair of comfortable sneakers.

Opt for distressed or faded jeans in a light wash for a vintage, lived-in vibe. Chunky sneakers in white or off-white are also a cool choice to balance out the outfit.

### Add a Skirt or Pants and Heels
To dress up a graphic tee a notch, replace the jeans or shorts with a skirt or pants and switch to heeled shoes. **Graphic tee outfit dressy** is perfect for a dinner date or night out. Try a Midi skirt in a solid color or subtle pattern that hits at the knee. Pair it with strappy flat or low block heels. Dark-wash skinny jeans work too when paired with pointed flats or low kitten heels. Accessorize with statement earrings, a watch or necklace to polish off the look.
### Layer with a Denim or Leather Jacket
Throwing on a jacket is an easy way to **transform graphic tee style** from day to evening. A classic denim or moto leather jacket never goes out of style. It adds structure and visual interest to an otherwise basic tee and jean combo. Cuff the sleeves of the jacket for a laidback vibe. Or leave sleeves unrolled if planning to head straight to after-work drinks from the office. Statement jewelry, loafers or boots in fall/winter complete the look. 
### Tuck it into High-Waisted Pants or a Skirt
t tucking in a graphic tee lets you show off your waistline while maintaining coverage. Itâ€™s perfect for those who want a polished put-together appearance. Opt for high-waisted wide-leg pants, a pencil skirt or A-line skirt that hits right at the natural waist. Make sure to neatly tuck in all edges of the tee for a smooth front. Finish with pointy flats, low heels or strappy sandals depending on the occasion. Layered necklaces add visual appeal.
### Try a Faux-Crop Style 
Rather than commit to a true cropped hem, fake the crop look by knotting the tee at the midriff or tucking the shirt ends into your bra or pants. **Faux cropped graphic tee** allows you to rock the trend without alteration. It works best for tees that are oversized or already hit at the hip bone area. Wear with high-waisted bottoms and layered jewelry as mentioned earlier. Sneakers are ideal but platform sandals will dress it up too on warm nights.
### Go Monochrome Top to Bottom
A solid monochrome outfit from head to toe creates a sleek, put-together aesthetic. **Monochrome graphic tee** coordinates seamlessly whether choosing black, grey, white or another hue. Skinny jeans, leggings or trousers in the same color ensure everything flows cohesively. Add pointy pumps, loafers or boots depending on the season. Gold or silver accessories provide pops of contrast. A blazer jackets it up for the office.
### Layer Graphic Tees
For chilly months, layering graphic tees of varying lengths beneath sweaters, jackets or vests is perfect for extra warmth without losing the graphic element. **Layered graphic tee outfit** channels athleisure or grunge vibes based on fabric/fit choices. Try longlayered tees with an oversized plaid button-down thrown over top. Thermal long sleeves or slim trousers in coordinating colors ground the look. 
### Wear with an A-Line Mini Skirt
Any graphic tee pairs well with an A-line mini skirt, whether solid, striped or printed. **Graphic tee and mini skirt combo** shows off legs but keeps tops covered. Opt for mini skirts in medium to dark wash denim, corduroy or tweed for day. Swap to black or another solid color at night. Slingbacks, loafers or oxfords complete the look along with tights or knee high socks depending on weather. Gold jewelry adds polish.
### Style with Wide Leg Pants
Relaxed wide leg pants are an effortlessly cool choice to style a graphic tee. **Graphic tee and wide leg pants outfit** is casual chic for day to evening. Try trousers in rich autumnal colors, subtle stripes or summery lightweight fabrics. Cuff the hem for extra slouch. Pair with slide on sandals, loafers or lace-up boots in similar styles to the pants. Layered necklaces draw attention upwards. Chunky knit cardigans provide warmth layered over top when temperatures drop.
### Tuck into High Waisted Denim or Corduroy Skirts
Denim and corduroy midi and maxi skirts lend an on-trend twist to any graphic tee. **High-waisted skirt graphic tee combo** is ideal for cool fall days. Neatly tuck in the shirt front for a polished silhouette. Opt for neutral graphic tees to let the textured skirt take center stage. Lace-up boots or loafers provide footing from autumn to early spring. Consider tights in various patterns or colors too for added visual interest. A leather or denim jacket rounds out layered looks.
### Wear under Overall Dungarees
Graphic tees pair perfectly under overall shorts or dungarees for an easygoing summery vibe. **Graphic tee and overalls outfit** channels laidback weekend countryside style. Choose light denim or natural fabric overalls for a breezy feel. Swap between sneakers, sandals or riding boots depending on activities. Braided or beaded necklaces along with floppy sunhats complete the effortless look. Consider rolled up sleeves layered under overall straps too.
