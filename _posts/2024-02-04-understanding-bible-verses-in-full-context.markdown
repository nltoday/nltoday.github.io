There seems to be an increasing trend of people taking verses out of the Bible and using them out of context to try and prove a point or push an agenda. However, doing so is intellectually dishonest and can lead others astray. To truly understand what God is communicating through Scripture, it is critical that we consider each verse within its wider literary and historical context. This multi-part series will explore the importance of proper context and provide examples of how context can change the meaning.
### Considering the Entire Book
The context of any single Bible verse is the [entire Biblical canon](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/adkinson). All Scripture is God-breathed and fits together like a puzzle to accurately portray God's redemptive story. A verse should never be cherry-picked on its own, as that can distort its intended meaning. We must measure each statement against the full counsel of God's Word.

### Avoiding "Proof Texting" to Push an Agenda
Some try to "proof text" by selectively citing verses which they think support preconceived notions, while ignoring passages that contradict those views. However, context shows that the Bible does not always teach what people want it to teach. We must humbly study Scripture for what it actually says, not force it to confirm our biases. When interpreted in isolation from its context, even a single word can radically alter a verse's meaning.
### Providing the Immediate Literary Context  
Considering the paragraphs or chapter surrounding a verse gives important clues about its intended message. In Isaiah 7:14, the immediate context shows that the prophecy about a "virgin will conceive" was a sign for King Ahaz regarding enemies besieging Jerusalem at that time. Pulling just that snippet out ignores that the chapter is centered around assuring Ahaz of God's deliverance through the impending birth of a child with a symbolic name.
### Examining the Historical-Cultural Context
Understanding the historical background further illuminates how original listeners/readers would have understood a passage. For example, the "virgin birth" claim in Isaiah 7:14 would not have necessarily meant Mary to ancient Israelites, as the Hebrew word could simply mean "young woman." We must be careful not to retroject modern linguistic notions onto ancient texts without considering how language and culture has changed over millennia.  
### Discerning the Overall Biblical-Theological Context
Each book of the Bible fits into the grand redemptive narrative connecting the Testaments. For instance, while Isaiah 7:14 pointed to a sign for Ahaz, Matthew picks up on its deeper import by highlighting how Jesus fulfills this **prophecy of the Messiah**. His supernatural conception and name "God with us" demonstrate his role as the Suffering Servant who would save Israel. No single verse conveys the whole story—only within its greater biblical context can true meaning emerge.
### Judging Claims of Contradiction or Absurdity
Some allege apparent contradictions or absurdity if single verses are taken at face value. However, reading in context normally resolves such issues. As an example, Christ's command against "judging" (Matthew 7:1) is part of a passage on **discerning** righteous judgment versus hypocritical condemnation. Jesus was highlighting the need for self-examination before criticizing others, not prohibiting all evaluations. Only superficially parsed can Scripture seem self-contradictory or nonsensical. 
### Addressing Attempts to Force Applications
At times people force modern applications or opinions onto Biblical texts. For the Bereans in Acts 17, Paul commended their practice of searching OT Scripture daily to confirm the truth of his teachings. They recognized that no individual—even an apostle—should override what God has clearly communicated through proper exegesis. We must humbly and prayerfully interpret in line with an author's original intent instead of proof-texting to feed preconceptions.
### Remaining Teachable and Correcting Past Errors
If shown compelling reasons for adjusting our understanding based on fuller context, we should acknowledge error and update beliefs accordingly. It is the height of folly to persist in a view if weight of evidence contradicts it. Scripture itself presents fallible people learning and growing in grace, unafraid to admit prior incorrect notions. We can emulate this humility by being teachable and not wedded to preconceptions when deeper biblical wisdom comes to light.
Overall, considering the full context—including the surrounding book, time period, Bible's grand storyline—is crucial for rightly understanding any portion of God's Word. Interpretating in isolation or attempting to force subjective meanings upon text can distort intended messages. With an attitude of teachability, we can continue learning how all of Scripture beautifully fits together like pieces of a divine puzzle.
