### Traumatic Memories From the Intensive Care Unit  
I still have vivid memories from my two-week stay in the intensive care unit after suffering multiple bone fractures that required emergency surgery. [The pain and uncertainty of recovery in an unfamiliar environment](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-best-dog-mom-ever-retro-usa-american-flag-123-chihuahua-dog) was one of the most difficult experiences of my life. Each day brought new challenges and anxieties as my body worked to heal from the injuries. 
The sterile hospital rooms and constant beeping of machines was jarring after the comfort of my own home. I would wake up disoriented, my memory hazy from the strong pain medications. Nurses and doctors filtered in and out of my room at all hours to monitor my vitals and change dressings. The fluorescent lights stayed on all day and night, disrupting my natural sleep cycle. Nights were the hardest as I lay awake, immobilized by my injuries with only my turbulent thoughts to keep me company.

### Traumatic Witnesses As a Psychiatric Inpatient  
My hospitalization experience in the psychiatric unit was equally distressing, though in different ways. As the youngest patient, I felt especially vulnerable and out of place amongst adults struggling with severe mental illness. **Witnessing episodes of psychosis, aggression and neglect had a profound psychological impact.** One memory that still haunts me is seeing an elderly man approach another patient's bed late at night while she slept. Her bloodcurdling screams filled the room as she realized what was happening. The lack of privacy and constant supervision chipped away at my sense of dignity during recovery.
### Loss of Freedom and Bodily Autonomy
A huge adjustment in the psychiatric unit was the complete loss of personal freedom and autonomy over my basic needs. Doors were always locked for "safety", but it served mainly to intensify feelings of confinement and powerlessness. Even using the bathroom required permission and wait times. Any personal possessions were banned in case they could be used for self-harm. Requests for contact with loved ones were subject to approval from staff. Each day blended into the next with no sense of control over my circumstances or treatment plan. This oppressive environment made recovery feel impossible at times.  
### Trauma From Inadequate Care and Oversight  
Too often, care felt dangerously lacking or inappropriate given the vulnerable patient population. **Medication errors, neglect and privacy breaches were distressingly common.** I will never forget witnessing a patient faint multiple times after being overmedicated, or the visible fear in another's eyes as she pleaded not to be left alone again. The hospital clearly struggled with inadequate resources and staff training and this directly impacted quality of care. While some staff tried their best under difficult conditions, others seemed apathetic or even harmful in their approaches. As a minor, I felt especially unprotected from these systemic failures. My complaints and concerns largely fell on deaf ears.
### Glimmers of Hope Amongst the Darkness
Not all memories from my hospitalization were negative. A few bright spots helped sustain my will to recover. I formed strong bonds with fellow patients going through similar struggles and we tried to find humor in dark moments. **Creative outlets like art therapy and time spent in the recreation room lifted our collective spirits.** Some healthcare workers, like my favorite nurse Amy, greeted each new day with patience and compassion. Small comforts like fresh air breaks, visitors and complimentary cigarettes reminded me that this difficult chapter was only temporary. With grit and resilience, even the darkest of times can be endured and hope can be found.
