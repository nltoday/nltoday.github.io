Newton School promises an immersive 6 month coding bootcamp experience. However, one student's experience highlights some concerning issues with their practices. Keep reading for an in-depth look into what really happened during their time at Newton School.
### Lack of Support and Communication
The student was initially excited to begin classes, but after only one month Newton School stopped providing online classes and support to non-IIT students. When asked why, they claimed the student did not have enough [projects completed](https://store.fi.io.vn/funny-xmas-this-is-my-christmas-pajama-heartbeat-video-game-98/women&), despite being in the top 4 of their batch. The student pushed for continued support but was told they would need to pay 50k outright, contradicting promises made during recruitment. Repeated attempts to get clarification and guidance from mentors went unanswered.

### Misleading Practices and Fake Representations  
Classes that were purportedly live sessions turned out to be **pre-recorded videos** from previous batches. Questions from current students were being ignored. To make matters worse, positive reviews on their website turned out to be from friends of the founders or paid employees - not genuine student feedback. This raised serious doubts about the transparency and integrity of Newton School's marketing.
### Unfulfilled Commitments and Unreasonable Demands
After 6 months, Newton School then claimed the student did not have enough **mentor hours** to be referred to companies, despite their lack of support discussed earlier. Further project requirements kept changing to avoid placement obligations. They even tried threatening legal action when the student refused an exorbitant post-placement fee, clearly taking advantage of students.
### Independent Success Despite Newton School 
Thankfully, the student was able to secure an internship at Rapido through their own network, proving Newton School provided no real value. All skills were self-learned through affordable outside resources like Udemy, not Newton School's subpar and misleading training. Others shared experiencing similar runarounds, highlighting systemic issues rather than isolated cases.
### Legal Action Against Deceptive Practices
Given the organized nature of fake positive reviews and threats against genuine student feedback, there are grounds for legal proceedings against Newton School. Their practices of false advertising, non-delivery of services and harassment of students raise serious ethical concerns. More awareness must be spread to discourage such profit-driven abuse of trust and compromise of education quality standards. 
### Takeaway for Aspiring Coders
In summary, abundant caution is advised before signing up with Newton School or similar unregulated coding bootcamps making bold empty promises. Although the dream of a new career is enticing, it's not worth compromising one's time and money on unclear commitments and intentionally misleading marketing. More robust regulation may be needed to protect learners from unscrupulous education providers.
