### Low Self-Discharge Cells
The "L" designation on coin cell batteries such as **CR2032-L** refers to low self-discharge cells. These cells were often used in applications that needed to retain power for long periods of time without draining, such as keeping the date and time on backup clocks in computers and appliances. **Low self-discharge coin cells** maintain their charge for longer when not in use compared to regular coin cells. However, manufacturers have improved the self-discharge properties of standard coin cells over time, making the performance difference less significant. As a result, some brands like Panasonic have discontinued producing low self-discharge versions.

### Duracell DL2032 Cells 
Duracell uses the prefix "[DL](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-gamer-computer-video-game-lover-gaming-dog-chihuahua-dog)" to identify their lithium manganese dioxide coin cells that are equivalent to the industry standard **CR2032 form factor**. The **DL2032** is simply Duracell's branded version of the CR2032 - they contain the same lithium manganese dioxide chemistry and have identical dimensions and electrical specifications. The only difference is the manufacturer and branding on the packaging. Consumers can use DL2032 cells as direct replacements for CR2032 cells in any application.
### Rechargeable Lithium Coin Cells
Rechargeable coin cells suitable for legacy applications designed for non-rechargeable lithium cells are available. These use the "**LR**" designation such as **LR2032** to indicate they can be recharged hundreds of times through a integrated charging circuit. However, rechargeable coin cells have some important limitations. They have a much higher cost than single-use cells. In addition, devices need to be designed specifically to charge the battery in order to take advantage of the rechargeability. Using rechargeable coin cells in non-charging applications would result in significantly shorter runtimes.
### Choosing the Right Coin Cell Battery
Unless an application specifically requires low self-discharge or rechargeability, standard **CR2032** cells from any reputable manufacturer will provide reliable performance for most light-load uses. In general, coin cell chemistry and dimensions are more important compatibility factors than the brand name or exact model number. Consumers can feel comfortable choosing whichever CR2032 cell meets their needs from a cost and availability perspective. Only in special use cases is the optional "L", "DL" or "LR" designation likely to make a practical difference in operation.
### Storing Partially Discharged Batteries 
It is generally not advisable to store batteries, including coin cells, in a partially discharged state for extended periods. Over time, **partially discharged batteries** can experience premature voltage drops that make them unsuitable even for low-power applications. When replacing batteries that will be inactive for months or years, it is best to use fresh cells with a full factory charge.Stored batteries should also be kept in a cool, dry place away from temperature extremes which can accelerate self-discharge. Following these simple practices helps ensure coin cells maintain their charge reserves and shelf life.
### Safety Considerations for Damaged Batteries
All batteries, even small coin cells, contain hazardous chemicals and should be handled carefully. No battery type is immune to leaks or explosions if mechanically or internally damaged. In particular, lithium coin cells like the **CR2032 can cause burns if punctured**. Anycoin cell showing signs of swelling, discoloration, rusting or leakage should be disposed of promptly according to local hazardous waste guidelines. Keep all batteries away from sources of heat, open flames and other potential ignition risks. Proper handling and disposal reduces safety issues and prevents environmental contamination from battery chemicals.
### Long-Term Storage Recommendations
For long-term coin cell storage exceeding two years, additional precautions beyond normal storage help maximize shelf life. Batteries maintained at temperatures below freezing can self-discharge more slowly and retain their charge for much longer periods compared to room temperature storage. As a result, winter conditions provide better conditions for storing coin cells intended for use many years later. Sealed bags with oxygen absorbers or desiccants inside moisture-proof containers also protect against corrosion from air and humidity during prolonged storage. With careful handling and storage practices, coin cells can reliably power devices even after five to ten years on the shelf.
