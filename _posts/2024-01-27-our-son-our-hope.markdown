### Building a Family
After trying for over a year to conceive, Marie and I were overjoyed when the home pregnancy test came back positive. The early weeks of her pregnancy were nerve-wracking but uneventful. At our 12-week ultrasound, we got to see our little peanut wiggling around and hear their strong heartbeat. We started preparing the nursery and daydreaming about family vacations. 
At our 20-week anatomy scan, the technician grew quiet. She asked us to wait for the doctor to come in and discuss the results. My heart sank as I watched Marie grip my hand tighter and tighter. The doctor somberly told us that abnormalities were detected- our baby had spina bifida. We were devastated. Over the next few months, we consulted with specialists and balanced hopes with hard facts. Marie’s prenatal tests came back with additional genetic markers that indicated the condition would be [severe spina bifida](https://store.fi.io.vn/funny-chihuahuas-halloween-costume-witch-chihuahua-dog-lover-312-chihuahua-dog). Termination was recommended due to the baby’s poor prognosis, but Marie and I couldn’t let go of our dream so easily. We decided to continue the pregnancy, care for our baby to the best of our abilities, and pray for a miracle.

### Preparing for the Worst
The remaining months of Marie’s pregnancy were an emotional rollercoaster. We researched **spina bifida care** extensively, connected with support groups, and met with neonatal specialists to create an extensive care plan for delivery and our baby’s first days. Marie’s spirits were low, and I did my best to stay positive and support her physically and emotionally. At our 32-week ultrasound, our sweet baby boy was thriving but his condition had not improved. We resigned ourselves to the fact that we were likely bringing home an infant requiring oxygen, feeding tube, and leg braces- if we brought him home at all. Marie’s delivery was scheduled for 37 weeks to avoid further risk.
### A Joyous Miracle
On a sunny August morning, Marie’s water broke right as we were leaving for the hospital. Her labor progressed smoothly considering the circumstances. When our son was placed on Marie’s chest, we were shocked- he was pink, breathing easily on his own, and starting to wiggle. His doctors were stunned; this was not at all what they had expected or prepared us for based on his **prenatal diagnosis**. After a few tests, they determined his spina bifida had closed up on its own in the womb, healing to the point that he would not require surgery or extensive support. We were overjoyed and overwhelmed by this miracle. Our prayers had been answered in the most beautiful way.
### Our Special Boy
Now at six months old, our son Noah is thriving. He has motor delays due to low muscle tone from the spina bifida but is meeting his milestones with **physical therapy**. We will continue to monitor his development carefully. Noah is constantly smiling, cooing, and babbling with his parents and older sister. Some days it’s hard to believe how far he’s come from the grim prognosis initially given. We feel deeply grateful for every smile, laugh and developmental win. Though his path may not be straightforward, our sweet boy is brightening every day with his joyful spirit and mischievous grin.
### Spreading Hope
Sharing Noah’s story has been an important way for Marie and I to process our journey and hopefully give hope to others facing prenatal diagnoses. Connecting with supportive communities has helped us feel less alone. We’ve spoken at spina bifida fundraising events about the importance of **palliative care research**, managing prenatal anxiety and making complex medical decisions with compassion. While we still grieve alternate timelines that could have been, every day with our miracle son is a gift. We will continue cherishing our family and spreading messages of resilience, faith and defying the odds.
