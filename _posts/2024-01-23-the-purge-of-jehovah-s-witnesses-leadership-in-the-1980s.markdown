### High-Ranking Witnesses Question Doctrines
In the early 1980s, several members of the Jehovah's Witnesses leadership started to openly question aspects of the organization's doctrines. Two prominent figures were Raymond Franz and Edward Dunlap. 
Franz had served on the [Governing Body](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cow-mom-cute-womens-70s-80s-retro-style-sunset-moo-moo-lover-v-neck-t-shirt/women&), the highest leadership position within the Witnesses. He was involved in researching and writing theological publications like the **Aid to Bible Understanding**. Through this process, Franz and his team discovered instances where the Witnesses' teachings did not align with the **biblical understanding**. 
Dunlap also held high positions, serving as the **Registrar of Gilead School** which trained missionaries. He too wrote theological works for the Witnesses. Both men were well-educated and devoted decades of their lives to full-time service for the organization. However, they began to privately express concerns about certain doctrines to each other and raise questions internally.

### Peter Gregerson Disassociates and New Rules Emerge
Around the same time, another elder named **Peter Gregerson** made the decision to disassociate from his local congregation. As an employer of many Witness workers, Gregerson did not want the shunning policy to impact his business. Until then, disassociating carried less severe consequences than being disfellowshipped. 
Taking note of Gregerson's action, the Governing Body seized an opportunity. They invented a new rule - anybody associating with a disassociated person would now be subject to the same shunning punishment. Franz was subsequently disfellowshipped for sharing a meal with Gregerson. 
Dunlap was also expelled for offering Franz employment after he lost his place at the Witnesses' world headquarters in Brooklyn. Over a dozen others met the same fate in what became known as the **"purge of apostates"** within the leadership ranks.
### The Shunning Tactic Intensifies Control
The new rules served no practical purpose related to doctrine. The real motivation was to strengthen the organizational control exerted through shunning. Losing one's family, friends and entire social circle over association with former members sends a strong deterring message. 
It indicated the Witnesses leadership's increasing fear of independent thinking and questioning of their authority. For men like Franz and Dunlap who demonstrated intelligence, critical thinking skills and a willingness to examine teachings more closely - their fate served as a warning.
The unintended consequence of these harsh new policies would be to accelerate the number of Witnesses who quietly faded away or formally left the religion. Faced with the prospect of having one's entire life erased, many chose to quietly distance themselves over time.
### Ed Dunlap Speaks Out About His Experience
In audio recordings available online, Ed Dunlap recounted his experience after being expelled from the organization he had dedicated 40 years of service to. He described the “serious problems” he found in several Watchtower articles and teachings. 
Dunlap detailed how he was interrogated by Governing Body members about his personal views, which differed from theirs on doctrines like the **"****rest of the anointed"**. He explained what led to his expulsion on charges of "apostasy". 
The soft-spoken yet wise Dunlap showed intelligence and objectivity in explaining both sides of the issues. His tone was one of sadness rather than anger towards the organization. The recordings provide a rare first-hand account from the perspective of one of Jehovah's Witnesses leadership who was purged.
### A Cracking of the Facade of Unity
Prior to the early 1980s, the Witnesses had projected an image of ideological unity and conformity. Individuals like Franz, Dunlap and Gregerson cracking that facade revealed the control was maintained more through fear and intimidation than true belief. Their principled stances weakened the perception of unanimity.
The purge triggered scrutiny of doctrines from growing numbers of Witnesses. Others who also had unanswered questions saw in Franz and Dunlap's experiences a reflection of their own doubts. The expulsions undermined trust in the Governing Body's claim of being guided by God alone in their teachings. 
In time, Cults Awareness Networks and ex-Witness support groups formed to help others escape the religion's harmful policies like shunning. The trail blazed by dedicated truth-seekers like Franz and Dunlap empowered many to find spiritual freedom.
Their legacy stood as a reminder that, in the words of Tyrion Lannister, when one cuts out another's tongue, all is revealed is their own fear of what might be said. The purge's far-reaching consequences continue to be felt within Jehovah's Witnesses and beyond even today.
