## My Inspiring Journey
### Falling in love with music
It was the summer of 2009 when I first discovered my hidden talent for dance. I was in 12th standard and Michael Jackson had recently passed away. One of my classmates was teaching everyone the iconic "moonwalk" that MJ popularized. Even though I had [no dance experience](https://yt.io.vn/collection/ahmadi), I decided to give it a try. When I performed it in front of the class, everyone laughed at how terrible I was. I was deeply embarrassed. But something inside me was ignited - I was determined to perfect this move.

### Finding my groove through YouTube 
That failure only fueled my desire to improve. With the rise of YouTube, I spent hours watching tutorial videos to refine my moonwalking. Soon, I was adding more complex moves like slides, glides and waves. While practicing in my room, I started moving to the beat without realizing. My body just flowed with the music. I found dancing to be a stress-buster and an emotional outlet. It brought me joy like nothing else.
### Stepping out of my shell
When I entered college in 2010, a dance audition was announced. I was shy and **self-conscious about my skills**. But I didn't want to live with regret. I mustered up courage and signed up. To my surprise, I was selected for the team based on my "natural talent and flair". This marked a turning point. I started learning various street styles like **hip hop, popping and locking**. I secured multiple awards and was considered the best dancer in college.
### Overcoming ego and pushing limits  
Success got into my head. I stopped practicing regularly and developed an inflated ego. It took effort to realize my shortcomings and get back on track. I strengthened my foundation and explored new territories like **breakdancing, house and liquid**. Pushing past comfort zones helped expand my range and versatility. Challenging myself kept the passion alive even during difficult phases.
### Sharing the magic of dance
After graduating in 2014, I took a creative challenge - teaching dance online. Through YouTube videos and Instagram tutorials, I shared my style and methods. Interacting with learners across the world inspired me daily. Seeing them light up and gain confidence boosted my own spirit. I was fulfilling my duty of passing on this beautiful art that gave me so much. 
## Anyone Can Dance
### Dance is within us all
My journey proved that no prior experience or training is needed to start dancing. All it requires is an open mind, willingness to experiment and heart full of rhythm. Our bodies are naturally inclined to move to a beat. We just need to tune in to that internal harmony and let loose.
### Self-learning is hugely empowering  
YouTube opened up a wealth of dance knowledge for the taking. Following online tutorials at your own pace cultivates self-awareness, discipline and patience. Figuring out moves through trial and error builds confidence in one's abilities. It's a personal exploration that nurtures individual expression above imitation. 
### Formal training enhances instinct 
While classes are optional, they offer guidance to sharpen innate talents. Studying under experts hones technique, builds an aesthetic sense and grounds dancers in tradition or style. Interacting with peers cultivates camaraderie and healthy competition to push artistic boundaries. A blend of self-teaching and institutional learning fuels greatest growth.
### Dance is for everyone, every body
From kids to seniors, all shapes and sizes can find joy in movement. Dance transcends restrictions of age, gender, size or disability. It brings people of varied backgrounds together through a shared language of expression. There are styles suitable for all moods and abilities. Our bodies were made to feel rhythm - we need only release inhibition and feel the music within.
## Following My Bliss 
### My constant evolution
A decade since I began, dance still feeds my soul each day. New passions emerge as I delve deeper - voguing, waacking, krump keep me energized. Exploration across genres like bharatanatyam, kathak and bhangra nourish my roots. Experimentation with fusions inspire creativity. Nurturing my craft through regular practice maintains freshness. 
### Sharing the joy freely
I now run community dance workshops focusing on inclusivity. By offering subsidized classes, all can access this therapy. Hosting outdoor jams breaks stereotypes, bringing diverse crowds together in harmony. Mentoring aspiring dancers fulfills my duty of cultivating more talents. Engaging through social media advocates for dance wellness globally.
### Marching to my own beat 
While accolades motivated initial growth, inner fulfillment drives me today. Chasing trends or validation from others breeds insincerity. Walking to my soul's rhythm through challenging ups and inspiring downs enriches life's quality. Unlearning stiffness to flow effortlessly wherever tunes play nourishes spirit. Dance will forever be my sanctuary of freedom and healing.  
## You Already Have What It Takes
So in conclusion, I encourage you to reflect within and reconnect to your natural impulse to move. Tap into rhythm that flows through our being. Dance needs no preparation - it requires only that we listen, and respond from our soul. However you express, just dance! For dance will lifts your spirit and light your inner fire. You already have the gift - rediscover and unleash your dancing spirit!
