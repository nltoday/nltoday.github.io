## Reflecting on her Mother's Health with Pancreatic Cancer
Jenna was reflecting on her mother's unexpected passing six years ago from pancreatic cancer. Only weeks before her diagnosis, her mother was healthy for her age of 66. She exercised regularly, ate healthy and maintained an active lifestyle. However, the aggressive cancer spread rapidly throughout her body. Less than two months after being diagnosed, she had passed away. Jenna still misses her mother dearly, though finds comfort knowing her ashes now rest on a shelf in her home.
### Recalling her Mother's Active Lifestyle 
**Elderly women's fitness and wellness**, her mother led an active retirement up until her sudden illness. She exercised regularly by going for walks around the neighborhood daily. Staying social was also important to her, as she spent afternoons with friends playing cards or having coffee. Her diet primarily consisted of home cooked, nutritious meals which Jenna believes kept her healthy for so long. Even at 66, she had no major health issues and seemed in good physical shape. The cancer diagnosis came as a complete shock, as there were no obvious signs something was wrong beforehand.
