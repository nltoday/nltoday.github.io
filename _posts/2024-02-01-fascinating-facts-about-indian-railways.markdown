### Comfort and Design  
Indian Railways puts significant efforts into designing coaches that provide maximum comfort for passengers. Train suspension systems are tuned to a resonance frequency of 72 bpm or 1.2 Hz, which is the rate most comfortable for the human body considering it matches our normal heartbeat. This allows most people to fall asleep easily on long train journeys.
