### Different Stores Have Different Policies
When you have unused gift cards, the first step is to check with the store that issued the gift card about their policy on redeeming the remaining balance for cash. Policies can vary between stores. Some stores may allow you to redeem the full remaining balance for cash, while others only allow using the balance to make purchases in their store. It's important to contact the specific store directly to understand your options.

### Using The Balance Towards A Purchase And Getting A Partial Cash Refund 
If the store does not allow redeeming the gift card balance directly for cash, one option is to purchase an item that is more expensive than the gift card balance. Pay the difference in cash, and then return the item a few days later to get a cash refund for the full purchase price. However, some stores may catch on to this tactic and only provide store credit instead of cash for the refund. Proceed with caution if trying this approach.

Different buyers may offer different prices depending on several factors like the gift card brand, remaining balance, and market demand. Use a site like Card Cash Magic to get an initial quote, but also check competing sites like Gift Card Granny and Raise to compare offers.

### Important Factors To Consider

- Store policies on redeeming balances for cash can vary significantly

- Selling online is usually fastest but involves shipping cards and waiting for payment transfer
- Always get competing offers to maximize the cash value received

# Factors Affecting Card Cash Magic Gift Card Buying Prices
### Current Market Demand 
Like any commodity, gift card resale values fluctuate based partly on supply and demand forces. When a particular retailer or card brand is more in-demand, buyers like Card Cash Magic can pay a higher percentage of face value. Less popular brands may only fetch 80-90% of the balance. So the same $50 card could fetch you $45 from one buyer but only $40 from another.
### Seller Reputation And History
Established online marketplace buyers like Card Cash Magic also factor a seller's reputation and previous transactions into offer pricing. New users may get slightly lower quotes until they've completed a number of smooth sales and developed a positive profile. But established power-sellers who consistently provide authentic cards can gradually receive premium pricing.
### Seasonal Demand Patterns 
Retail "shopping seasons" like the winter holidays bring increased demand for certain gift cards too. While rates remain competitive year-round, you may get quoted 1-2% more around November through January when buyers forecast higher redemption rates. Likewise, restaurant cards see a boost around Valentine's Day. It pays to time your sales strategically when possible.
### Payment Processing Fees 
The payout method you choose like PayPal, bank transfer or Bitcoin also affects the net cash received marginally since buyers deduct any costs they incur from payout providers. Generally cheaper options like Zelle transfers allow buyers to offer the best rates. Opt for low-cost withdrawals when max price is a priority.
### Unused Card Balances
As with anything, lower denominations usually fetch lesser rates percentage-wise. A $50 balance leftovers will convert at a higher rate than trying to sell multiple $5 cards. Card Cash Magic is usually most accommodating of bigger ticket, unused full balances in high demand.
In the end, getting quotes from multiple respected buyers ensures you capitalize gift cards at their best available current market value. Due diligence serves sellers well in this fluid resale marketplace.
