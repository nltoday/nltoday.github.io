### Monitoring Price Drops with SteamDB
One of the best tools for tracking price drops on Steam games is SteamDB. With SteamDB, you can check the full price history of any game on Steam to see how prices fluctuate over time.

### Utilizing Steam's Wishlist and Notifications 
Another effective method is adding desired games to your Steam wishlist. Steam will then send email or mobile notifications whenever a wishlisted title goes on sale. This makes it easy to view all the games you want in one place and be alerted to price drops. Rather than randomly checking scores of games, wishlisting organizes everything and ensured you never miss a discounted game. For effortless **game sale tracking and notifications,** utilizing Steam wishlists is a smart choice.
### Finding Regional Deals with Community Sites  
Beyond individual storefronts, online communities also serve as sources for game deals. In Australia, OzBargain is a prime location. This deal-sharing site allows users to post any game promotions they discover, whether free trials, discounts or giveaways. Thanks to an engaged user base, virtually no deal goes unnoticed. By regularly browsing OzBargain, you can take advantage of all the [regional PC and console deals](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/corgi) other local gamers encounter.
### YouTube Channels for Game Giveaway Alerts
YouTube channels dedicated to promoting free games are also valuable resources. One recommending channel is Santiago Santiago which maintains an active focus on alerting subscribers to games becoming free-to-keep on services like Steam, GOG, Epic and Humble Bundle. So even without browsing deal sites yourself, you can stay on top of the latest **free PC games through dedicated YouTube alert channels.** Hit the notification bell and you'll never miss another free title drop. 
### Dedicated Steam Free Game Tracker 
For a one-stop overview of all current and upcoming free games on Steam itself, SteamDB's dedicated promotions page is ideal. Here, every free weekend, free trial period and permanent free release is tracked with release dates shown. Knowing what's available for **zero cost on your preferred PC gaming platform through a single tracker page** removes the hassle of searching individual game pages. It's the most direct route to claiming free games on Valve's digital storefront.
### Combining multiple sources for maximum coverage
Of course, relying on just one channel or site leaves possibilities that some promotions could slip through the cracks. The savviest bargain hunters employ a multi-pronged approach, tapping major deal aggregators, YouTube channels, individual storefront tracking tools and local deal communities all at once. By taking full advantage of deals highlighted across various mediums mentioned here, serious PC gamers can ensure they never pay full price when dedicated **free game and deal aggregating sources** across the web exist.
