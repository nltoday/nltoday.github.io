### Boost Engagement with the Perfect Background Music  
Facebook Reels have seen huge success since their launch, allowing creators to easily produce entertaining short-form videos. However, finding the right background music is key to fully engaging viewers. Using copyrighted tracks could risk your account, so it's important to identify legitimate sources of Royalty-free music. 
Facebook's in-built [Sound Collection](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-american-foxhound-dog-santa-hat-ugly-christmas-2) is extremely convenient for creators. Accessible through Creator Studio on desktop, it provides tracks fully clear to use without restrictions. The curated library covers various genres and moods to match any reel. While limited compared to external options, it saves hunting endlessly elsewhere.

### Stock Music Sites Offer Instrumental Options
If Sound Collection lacks your preferred style, look to stock audio marketplaces. Sites like **Epidemic Sound** and **AudioJungle** hold large inventories of instrumental compositions licensed for both commercial and non-commercial use. Browsing by mood, genre or instrumentation swiftly reveals fitting backgrounds. 
True, vocal tracks are rarer due to licensing costs. But instrumentals still boost engagement through pleasant, upbeat accompaniment. Careful selection creates cohesive moods matching reel topics. And affordable subscription plans provide unlimited downloads, perfect for consistent content production.
### Creative Commons is a Treasure Trove of Royalty-Free Tracks 
Another excellent free option is the **Creative Commons** website. As a non-profit organisation, they aim to expand public domain works and encourage sharing. Browsing genres on their homepage accesses a treasure trove of **royalty-free music tracks**.
Creative Commons licenses stipulate various usage rights like allowing commercial exploitation. So tracks from trusted artists can feature risk-free, increasing reel quality. Advanced search filters also find works by specific parameters like instrumentation. It's a hidden gem many overlook.
### AI Music Generators Provide Limitless Customization  
As AI rapidly evolves, creative tools are emerging that reshape content creation. **Anthropic's Jukebox** utilizes deep learning to generate original instrumental compositions based on descriptive text. Simply describe desired elements and an AI model produces a tailored soundtrack within parameters. 
The flexibility to specify mood, genre, instrumentation and more guarantees a perfect musical match. Equally, **Splice's AI Jams** synth engine allows remixing customized AI creations on the fly for a unique finished product. Such generative technologies open limitless musical possibilities suitable for any reel theme or visuals. 
### Discover Independent Artists on Platforms Like SoundCloud
Major platforms also house indie artists open to collaboration. SoundCloud in particular aims to help emerging creators gain exposure. Browsing genre tags finds lesser-known tracks that may be available for reels under the right deal. Direct messaging composers expresses interest in featuring their music in exchange for promotion.
Many welcome the opportunity for broader reach. Negotiate non-exclusive limited licenses detailing allowed platforms and duration. Proper credits maintain positive relationships and potentially lead to future partnerships if videos gain traction. It's a mutually beneficial arrangement when approached respectfully.
### Consider Commissioning Original Compositions
For particularly important or story-driven reels, an original composition could make the biggest impact. While costlier than stock options, commissioning new music tailored perfectly to visuals often enhances emotions. Research local musicians through sites like **Fiverr** matching styles sought. 
Clearly outline budget, deadline and desired creative direction. Agree on delivery of high-quality audio files and terms of exclusive rights. Producing exclusive songs develops professional relationships and shows support for independent artists too. Remember original scores elevate productions beyond stock elements when dollars allow.
### Remix Public Domain Classics with Careful Edits 
Music in the public domain faces no copyright, allowing free use and modification. However, any changes must avoid significantly resembling the original work to sidestep legal issues. With care, public domain melodies can inspire new instrumental versions as backgrounds. 
For example, creative transformations of pieces century-old involve selective muting, additional instrumentation layers, or pitch/tempo shifting far enough for plausible deniability. Proper attribution also respects original composers. While risky without legal guidance, public domain offers potential for unique scores through transformative remixing.
### In Summary, Finding the Right Fit Requires Careful Research
As Facebook Reels continue growing, background music will remain integral to viewer retention and shares. The options above represent legitimate pathways to tasteful, legal backing tracks with minimal effort. Thorough researching each source's terms prevents unintended violations. 
Remember - quality, not quantity should dictate music selection. Careful matching to reel tone enhances experiences over careless inclusions. Stay diligent in proper credits too to build trusted profiles within growing entertainment spheres. Overall, with due diligence, copyright-free music ensures legal creation and promotion on social platforms.
