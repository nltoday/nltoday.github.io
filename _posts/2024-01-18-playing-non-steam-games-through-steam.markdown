Launching non-Steam games and cracked games through the Steam platform without detection.
### Running Other Games While Appearing Offline  
Steam does not actively monitor what games you have installed outside of its platform, especially **non-SteamPCgames**. It only checks for any programs that may interfere with the Steam software itself or any game with Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) enabled. [Unauthorized game copies](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-riding-shark-jawsome-dog-lover-gifts-space-galaxy-chihuahua-dog) are generally not detectable as long as they do not directly interact with the core Steam processes or protected multiplayer games. 
To be extra cautious, you can put your Steam account in **Offline Mode** to avoid any potential online checks while playing other installed titles. This prevents Steam from syncing with the Steam servers and notifying your friends about your current activity. Just make sure to go back Online later to access your Steam library and services as usual.

### Steam URI Scheme for Adding Non-Steam Games
Through its **UriScheme protocol**, Steam actually allows users to add and launch any PC game through a simple URL, whether it's in the Steam library or not. The format is **steam://run/AppId** where AppId is the unique number identifier of that game on Steam. 
For example, to open Grand Theft Auto V which has the AppId 271590, you can enter "steam://run/271590" in your browser URL bar or create a desktop shortcut with that link. Steam will recognize the game and launch it without needing to be in the official library. This opens opportunities to discreetly run other game installs that are not supposed to be on the Steam platform.
### Keeping Unauthorized Copies Private  
Nobody can definitively say Steam actively checks what **non-Steam games** or **cracked titles** you have installed unless you disclose that information publicly. Even games manually added to the Steam library through its database IDs are not automatically visible to or monitored by Valve. 
The only way they could find out is if users openly admit to having unauthorized copies. For example, by directly asking about it on forums, discussions, or other public channels. It is generally safe to assume playing other games through Steam stealthily poses no real risk of detection. Of course, avoid any potential legal issues and only run properly bought games.
### Limitations of Non-Steam Functionality
While the **URIScheme protocol** permits adding outside games, it only launches them and lacks full integration with Steam. These non-Steam games won't have access to overlay, chat, screenshots, stats tracking, cloud saves and other social features available for titles within the official library. 
Achievements and playtime won't be tracked either. Furthermore, launching via the URL bar limits options compared to the client GUI. Custom categories, properties editing, and libraryorganizationare not supported. It serves for discreet launching only without complete platform integration.
### Valve's Focus on Their Store Transactions
As a storefront business, Valve's top priority is protecting transactions happening through the official Steam platform and multiplayer experience. Everything outside their store purchases and online services receive very little scrutiny.
Valve tracks game **license ownership** mainly through purchase receipts and multiplayer usage for VAC protection. Other personal software installed and run independently pose no direct concern. Their anti-piracy efforts target redistribution rather than individual users' undisclosed private setups.
Unless sharing pirated content publicly or hacking protected games, running other game installs discreetly through Steam likely invites no issues. But remember only to enable these methods for properly bought titles to avoid legal troubles. For full-featured usage, games are best played natively or bought on Steam directly.
### Risks of Admission Vs. Plausible Deniability 
While the chances of getting flagged for having other games installed through Steam are slim practically, some risks do exist from admissions of piracy. Steam may not actively check libraries but could take action in response to public confessions. 
On forums, do not directly state owning **unauthorized game copies** or acknowledge using Steam to launch **cracked games**. Phrasing questions hypothetically without asserting personal details helps maintain plausible deniability. Someone may look into accounts publicly promoting piracy. 
In private, the risks are even lower. As long as games run without interfering with core functions and servers, Steam likely can't detect what's installed. Play discreetly without sharing and any bans probably wouldn't find the source. But purchasing titles legally is always safer and supports developers.
Overall, running other games through Steam for convenience may work without issues. While some limited integration exists, it's best to buy titles on authorized stores and platforms. Discretion is key to avoiding risks from volunteer confessions when the software itself provides enough privacy by default. Having plausible deniability of any wrongdoing is safest.
