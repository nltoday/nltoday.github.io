### Prophets in Islam
In Islam, it is believed that all of the prophets, including Jesus, Moses, Abraham, and Muhammad, came with the message of surrender to the one true God and to lead people towards the path of righteousness. However, Islam also teaches that Muhammad was the final and ultimate prophet, and that his message of surrender to Allah (God) and obedience to his commandments is the final and perfect revelation of the divine will. 
In Islam, Moses, Jesus, Abraham, and the other prophets are considered to be Muslim, which means "one who submits" to God. Islam teaches that these prophets were sent to guide humanity towards the worship of God alone, without any intermediaries, and that their message of monotheism and obedience to God is the same as the message that was taught by Muhammad and the Qur'an.

### The Message of Jesus in Islam
That being said, it's important to note that while Islam believes in the existence of past prophets and their messages, it does not believe in the divine nature of Jesus or the concept of the trinity, which is central to Christian doctrine. Islam teaches that Jesus was a prophet of God and that he was sent with the message of worshipping Allah alone and rejecting polytheism and idolatry. Jesus preached the truth of One God to his followers and tried to show people the straight path of righteousness according to Islamic beliefs. 
### Status and Respect for Jesus in Islam
In Islam, Jesus is given a unique recognition and honor. He is mentioned by name 25 times in the Quran, in contrast Prophet Muhammad is only mentioned 4 times. Muslims are also taught to say "peace be upon him" after referring to Jesus, which serves to highlight the great status of Jesus in Islam. Jesus is one of the five greatest prophets in Islam and the Quran reveals how Mary, the mother of Jesus, was chosen to give birth to a righteous son and prophet of God. 
A [whole chapter](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-crass-christmas-gnome-matching-family-ugly-v-neck-t-shirt/men&) in the Quran is dedicated to Mary, making her the only woman to have a chapter named after her. Muslims cannot represent an image of Jesus out of respect and believing that no one can do justice to his image. They consider representing him as one of God's prophets in images or cartoons to be a great disrespect and blasphemy.
### Beliefs About Jesus' Birth and Miracles
Similar to Christians, Muslims believe in the miraculous conception and virgin birth of Jesus. The Quran goes into great detail about this event, describing Mary as one of the purest and most devout women. However, Islam rejects the idea that Jesus was the son of God. God draws a parallel between the unique births of Adam and Jesus, who were both created miraculously without a father. 
Muslims also acknowledge the miracles performed by Jesus, such as healing the sick and blind, through the permission and power of God. The miracle of Jesus giving life to birds from clay is mentioned in the Quran. These miracles were meant to convince people of Jesus' prophetic message, not his own divinity according to Islamic teachings. 
### Jesus in the Prophethood of Muhammad
Jesus is notable for being the second to last prophet before Muhammad. He foretold the coming of a final prophet, which Muslims believe was a prophecy about Muhammad. There is a hadith where Prophet Muhammad emphasized his closeness to Jesus among all prophets. Both Jesus and Muhammad shared the message of monotheism and worship of the One God. They taught moral virtues and tried to guide people towards righteousness.
### The Return of Jesus
Muslims believe Jesus will return to earth in the end times, just before the Day of Judgment. He will defeat the false messiah (known as Dajjal or the Antichrist in Christianity) and establish peace on earth. This is consistent with both Islamic and Christian eschatology. His second coming is a sign of God's promise and power according to Islamic texts and traditions.

### Common Ground Between Christian and Muslim Views 
Christians and Muslims share many similarities in their beliefs about Jesus' life. Both religions believe he performed miracles and was born to the Virgin Mary through divine intervention without a human father. They agree Jesus preached monotheism and the importance of following God's commandments. Christians and Muslims are waiting for Jesus' ultimate return as well.
### Differences in Interpreting Jesus' Message
The key difference is that Muslims do not believe Jesus was divine or the son of God. They see him as a righteous prophet with a message of **Tawheed (Islamic monotheism)**. Christians believe Jesus was God incarnate in human form based on certain biblical passages. Muslims also reject the Christian doctrine of the Trinity. According to the Quran, on the Day of Judgment Jesus will deny claims of his divinity. 
### Honoring Mary, the Mother of Jesus
Aside from dedicating a whole chapter to her, Mary or Maryam holds high esteem in Islam as the virgin mother of Jesus. Both Christianity and Islam accord her a position of great honor. She is an exemplary role model of virtue, faith and righteousness for all believers according to Islamic texts and traditions.

### The Status of Jesus in Islamic Eschatology 
Islam assigns Jesus an active role near the end of times in its eschatological beliefs. When the false messiah Dajjal emerges to confuse humanity, Jesus will return to defeat him and establish justice. Then Gog and Magog will appear, wreaking havoc until destroyed by God. After Jesus' death, all people will be resurrected for the Day of Judgment. So Jesus has an important place in Islamic end times theology.
### Why Is Jesus Prominent in the Quran?
Given his high status and frequent mentions in the Quran, Muslims see Jesus as an inspiration of faith and righteousness. The detail given to his story shows God's blessings upon him. Emphasizing Jesus' message of **Tawheed** or monotheism was also important for early Muslims facing accusations of abandoning prior Abrahamic faiths. So the Quran underscores Jesus' continuity with Islamic preaching of pure faith in the One Indivisible God.
### Was Jesus the Last Prophet Before Muhammad?  
According to Islamic tradition, Muhammad was the final prophet while Jesus was the second to last. There was no prophet sent between them, so Muslims see continuity between their messages. Just as Jesus foretold the coming of "Ahmad", Muslims interpret this as a prophecy of the Prophet Muhammad. So Muslims accept Jesus as a link connecting them to the previous Abrahamic faiths he preached, while Muhammad conveyed God's final, perfected revelation.
# Jesus in Islam (Conclusion)
### Jesus' Lifelong Impact as a Role Model
For Muslims, Jesus continues inspiring humanity as a role model of righteousness, service to God and humility despite living over two millennia ago. He shows living purely for others out of love for the Almighty. Christians and Muslims can celebrate their shared love and admiration of Jesus' selfless life dedicated to guiding all people towards Godly principles of compassion, mercy, justice and virtue.
### A Unifying, Timeless Message of Peace 
Jesus' message transcends political or social boundaries. By submitting to One Eternal God, all people can come together in harmony. Both Quran and Bible repeatedly espouse peace upon obeying the Lord's commandments to deal kindly with one another. So by upholding Jesus' beautiful teachings of respect, goodwill and care for the needy, diverse groups can build strong yet sensitive relations honoring our shared origins. 
### Bridging Communities with Deeper Jesus Knowledge
By learning more about how Jesus inspires and unites Muslims and Christians, both faiths can overcome biases and forge bonds of understanding. Appreciating each other's perspectives provides keys to resolving conflicts peacefully through open and honest dialogue. Exploring our **common ground** regarding Jesus' pivotal role will help future generations embrace ethical virtues transcending all divisions in an increasingly pluralistic world.
