### Butter is Brilliant with Beef 
Real butter is an underrated condiment for red meat dishes. As the passage notes, [buttered steaks](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cowboy-howdy-horse-rider-western-cool-v-neck-t-shirt/women&) are a simple classic that highlight the beefy flavors. A **compound garlic and mushroom butter** takes it to the next level with savory umami notes from the fungi. Melting the seasoned butter over the hot steak infuses lots of moisture and richness.

### Balsamic Reduction Boosts Beef
For pan-seared cuts with prominent marbling, a **balsamic reduction sauce** accentuates the tender, beefy bites. Its intense sweet-sour profile acts like a flavor amplifier without overwhelming the starring ingredient. In the pan, maple syrup and balsamic vinegar meld into a honey-like glaze thick enough to cling to the meat. Just a drizzle is all that's needed to lift the dish.
### Crunchy Toppings for Curries and Stews
Water-based beef preparations like curries and stews call for textural contrast. **Toasted nuts** or **fried onions** provide that satisfying crunch between mouthfuls of tender chunks in a broth. Nut butters blended into the stew offer a similar effect. Either garnishing works well to balance rich, soft flavors with a crackling note. 
### Classic Rice and Vegetables for Poultry
Chicken is a versatile protein that pairs well with many sides. **Oven-roasted vegetables and basmati rice** make the perfect accompaniment to both simple and complex chicken dishes. A colorful medley of seasonal veggies tossed with olive oil, salt and pepper bakes up tender with caramelized edges. Fluffy rice soaks up savory pan juices without overwhelming the main ingredient.
### Unexpected Hummus and Relish Dip
Looking to jazz up store-bought chicken? Try an untraditional **hummus and relish dip**. The pickled veggie relish offers brightness to offset the rich chickpea puree. With its velvety texture and blending of flavors, this dip enhances rather than competes with mild poultry. It works as long as the chicken itself stays on the dry side recipe-wise. 
### Seafood Needs Support from Sides
Delicate fish calls for complementary sides to reinforce its delicate ocean flavors. **Fish and chips** do this perfectly with crispy fries, creamy mushy peas and tartar sauce for contrasting flavors and textures. A high-end fillet pairs well with **charred Brussels sprouts, parmesan and herb roasted potatoes** - bold ingredients that sing alongside the seafood without overpowering it. For ease, a **lemon pasta** provides acidity and creaminess to light fish dishes.
### Global Sauces Unite Disparate Dishes
When looking for one versatile sauce for meat, poultry and seafood, a **soy, vinegar and sugar blend** does the trick. Its balanced flavor profile works for almost any protein. However, tailored sauces often better enhance specific dishes. Some consistently great options include **Worcestershire-based** and **mint yogurt** sauces for beef and chicken respectively, while **r√©moulade** complements mild fish very well. With judicious mixing and matching, perfect pairings are within easy reach.
