### Containing the Initial Outbreak
With thousands if not millions of infected individuals suddenly becoming reanimated zombies across major population centers, containment of the initial outbreak would be the number one priority for militaries around the world. Well-trained soldiers familiar with following orders and exercising discipline even in stressful situations would work to establish secure perimeters around infected areas. Barricades, roadblocks, and checkpoints would be set up to restrict access in and out of hot zones, slowing the spread as response teams work within to address the initial pockets of infected.

### Evacuating and Quarantining Civilians  
While containment efforts get underway, special evacuation and medical brigades would work to remove uninfected civilians from outbreak areas. [Military logistics](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/aldaco) would be key to efficiently transporting large numbers of evacuees to temporary quarantine zones established well outside of infected regions. These holding areas would provide food, shelter and medical screening to ensure any latent infections don't spread further. Psychologists and counselors would also be on hand to help civilians cope with the traumatic events.
### Reconnaissance and Aerial Surveillance
As the scale of the outbreak becomes clearer, stealth reconnaissance teams and **military drone technology** would be utilized to track the movements and gather intelligence on infected concentrations. Heat signatures and movement patterns observed from above could help response strategists map the spread and pinpoint where best to focus containment and elimination efforts. This would minimize unnecessary risk to ground forces while maximizing situational awareness of the enemy disposition. 
### Establishing Secure Bases and Firebases  
Away from population centers, the military would quickly transform existing facilities like training grounds and reserves into more permanent operational bases. Well-defended firebases would also be established overlooking vulnerable areas or along evacuation routes where larger concentrations of zombies amass. From these secure positions, troops could continuously monitor for threats and conduct targeted long-range engagements without exposing themselves to unnecessary danger.
### Eliminating Concentrated Masses
Once containment lines are holding and civilian evacuation is complete, the focus shifts to actively addressing pockets of large zombie masses. Here, the military's full arsenal of heavy weapons could be brought to bear without restraint. Air strikes, missile bombardments, and armored vehicle assaults would make light work of crushing densely packed infected gangs. Drones could also be outfitted with incendiary or explosive payloads to clear wide areas from a safe distance. By methodically eliminating dense hordes, relief would come to besieged outposts and routes could reopen. 
### Mopping Up Scattered Infected 
While pockets of larger masses would present obvious targets, attention must also be given to the scattered infected left behind. Mounted and motorized patrols would conduct sweeps through devastated neighborhoods and countryside, quietly and efficiently dispatching any stragglers encountered. For the more remote rural zones, attack helicopters could also be utilized to rapidly cover large tracts of land. With patience and thoroughness, even the most isolated zombies could be accounted for, truly stamping out any remaining vestiges of the plague.
### Reformation and Reconstruction
Once the immediate crisis subsides, military forces would transition their focus to longer term recovery goals. Engineers would work to restore severed infrastructure and key facilities, reconnecting isolated zones. Medical personnel would continue screening and treatment efforts, while psychologists support ongoing civilian stabilization programs. Gradual demobilization could see combat units transitioned to peacekeeping roles or redeployed to areas still dealing with sporadic outbreaks. Ultimately, with the infection eradicated, soldiers could stand down as societies rebuilt themselves in the post-apocalyptic landscape.
