The human visual system is often misunderstood when it comes to its capabilities in perceiving frames per second (fps). Let's break down the facts from myths to better understand the complexities of human vision.
### Physiological Limits of the Visual Nerves
Messages are transmitted in the human body via myelinated nerves which can fire between 300 to 1000 times per second. [Visual information processing speed](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-yoga-chi-chi-namaste-dog-chihuahua-dog) is transmitted at 200 miles per hour via these nerves in the eyes. So theoretically, the eyes are capable of interpreting up to 1000 frames per second physiologically. 
However, when explicitly asking people to identify frame rates, experiments have found the average person can accurately perceive frame rates of up to around 150 fps. Beyond this point, additional increases in frame rate result in diminishing returns for detectability.

### Origins of the 60fps Myth  
The common myth that the human eye's limit is 30-60 fps can be traced back to early film technologies. When movies were shot on physical film reels, limiting the frame rate to 24 fps helped reduce film costs significantly by cutting material needs in half compared to 48 fps.
With the advent of affordable **digital video storage**, these old constraints are now irrelevant. However, the ingrained standard of 24 fps films coupled with early computer monitors capped at 60Hz refresh rates contributed to the widespread but inaccurate belief that 30-60 fps is the true upper limit.
### Dispelling the 30-60fps "Ceiling"
While people may not reliably distinguish frame rates above 150 fps in controlled tests, there is clearly still a noticeable visual difference all the way up to at least that threshold. Anyone with access to higher refresh rate monitors can easily spot the difference between 60Hz and 120Hz+ displays for **smooth motion rendering**.   
### Pilot Reaction Time Tests Disprove the Limit 
Studies conducted by the US Air Force found pilots were consistently able to perceive images displayed for only 1/220th of a second, proving the visual system can interpret single frames faster than any proposed 30-60fps limit. Their results indicate our vision is capable of distinguishing **motion blur** at refresh rates well above 60fps.
### Personal Experiments Reveal Breakpoints
Doing side-by-side gaming tests on various refresh rate monitors from 30Hz up to 144Hz revealed some key takeaways: 
- 30Hz looks choppy during fast turns 
- 60Hz is acceptable but 80Hz and 100Hz feel noticeably smoother
- The largest improvement is between 60-100Hz
- 120Hz and 144Hz approach a virtually indistinguishable level of smoothness from our natural vision
These personal experiments confirm that refresh rate increases up to 100-120Hz provide worthwhile benefits to the perception of **smooth gameplay**.
### Vision is Adaptable with Practice  
While innate physiological limits provide an upper bound, the brain's plasticity allows vision to be trained for improved performance. Regular exposure to higher frame rates through gaming or other fast-paced activities could enhance one's ability to detect motion over time through neural adaptation.
### Comparing to Other Senses is Misleading
It's inaccurate to directly equate the visual system to a camera since our senses work differently. Vision integrates information non-linearly over time rather than functioning like a series of still frames. Comparing it to the reaction speeds of simpler animals also neglects our enhanced cognitive abilities.
### Conclusion
In summary, the human eye is capable of much higher frame rate perception than the commonly cited 30-60fps limits suggest. Both scientific experiments and anecdotal subjective comparisons consistently show noticeable benefits from refresh rates into the 100-200fps+ range. With practice, our vision adapts to perceive motion increasingly clearly at higher frame rates.
Rather than hard caps, the relationship between visual acuity and fps is better characterized by thresholds of diminishing returns. Overall, our understanding of human perception should move past inaccurate myths to an appreciation of its rich complexity.
