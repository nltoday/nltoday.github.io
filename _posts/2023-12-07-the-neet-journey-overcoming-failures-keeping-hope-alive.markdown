## Falling at the First Hurdle
My NEET preparation journey began in 2020 after completing my 12th grade. Without any coaching, I registered for NEET 2021 to gain some experience. However, I was ill-prepared and scored only 437 marks. Though disappointed, I was determined to work hard and improve.  
## Starting Afresh with Online Coaching
I enrolled for an online NEET coaching program and started preparing diligently from June 2021. By July, NEET was postponed to September, giving me more time to prepare. However, due to the limitations of online learning and lack of effective revision, I scored only 438 marks in NEET 2021. While heartbroken, I drew encouragement from scoring in the 90th percentile and was confident of success with focused preparation.
### Struggling with Resources 
I restarted my preparation in early 2022 with full dedication, straining my eyes for 6-7 hours daily on mobile/online classes. The experience was challenging due to technical difficulties like inability to change playback speed. Nonetheless, I pushed through and completed the syllabus by March with the help of online resources.

### Facing Adversity in NEET 2022
NEET 2022 didn't go as hoped. Due to [time management errors](https://store.fi.io.vn/dog-breed-schipperke-funny-s-for-dog-lovers348-2) and **silly mistakes**, I scored only 587 marks. Devastated, I lost all hope and considered quitting. However, my parents' support renewed my spirit. I took a short break to mentally recharge.
## Steadfast spirit in the Face of Failures  
In October 2022, I rejoined an offline test series with renewed zeal. I exploited **free educational resources** available online, regularly giving tests and addressing weaknesses. My scores improved steadily but dipped during revisions, testing my courage. Undeterred, I kept practicing diligently while balancing studies with helping my father.
### A Ray of Hope Emerges
By late 2022, I began scoring above 600 consistently in tests. Encouraged, I believed NEET 2023 would be easier. I also gave additional tests from other platforms. In the last month, I re-read chemistry and focused on improving subjects like organic chemistry that were my Achilles heel previously.
## The Big Day Arrives
On 7th May 2023, confusion arose after reaching the wrong examination centre as per the incorrect address on my admit card. Although distressed initially, my father's calm demeanor helped us eventually locate the right venue on time. During the exam, I tackled **biology first** being my strongest. However, silly mistakes in the other subjects due to **time pressure** affected my performance.
## Results and Reflections 
Unofficially, my NEET 2023 score is around 620-630 marks - good enough only for a mid-tier medical college given my general category status. I'm disappointed with not maximizing my potential but have accepted the outcome, gaining valuable lessons. I'm evaluating whether to take another drop to improve consistency and overcome weaknesses in **organic chemistry** and **botany**. Only time will tell the path ahead in this testing yet fulfilling NEET journey.
