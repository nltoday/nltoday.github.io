## Importance of Checking Status and Following Up
It is always a good practice to keep checking the status of your application and following up with the recruiters. **As evident from past examples, companies like Accenture might revoke offer or inform candidates on the day of joining that they won't be onboarded without providing proper reasons.** To avoid such situations, it is recommended to remain in touch with recruiters and do periodic follow ups. People have faced issues where they were not informed about status updates or changes in the portal as well. Constant communication ensures you are aware of latest developments.
### Communication is Key 
Following up regularly delivers multiple benefits. It shows your interest and engagement in the process. recruiters get to know you better through interactions. Any queries or concerns can be addressed on time. Last minute surprises are avoided. Since joining processes involve coordination between multiple internal teams, follow ups help track progress and flag delays if any. Regular reminders keep your application on priority. Smooth onboarding depends a lot on timely status updates and clear communication throughout the recruitment cycle.

## Accenture's Poor Post-Interview Etiquette
Accenture reportedly displays unprofessional behavior in their post-interview formalities compared to other top tech companies. 
### Frustrating Recruitment Process
As per one experience shared, the candidate cleared all assessment rounds including exam and technical interview. They were informed that HR will contact them soon as feedback was positive. However, HR never reached out as promised. Repeated emails and calls went unanswered, showing lack of responsibility. 
### Constant Delays and Empty Promises  
In another instance, after document submission, Accenture replied that candidature was in progress and next steps update will be provided. But HR remained untraceable, ignoring candidates. Only when called from different number did they receive the call to suggest dropping email, with no future response again. 
### Holding Profiles Without Communication
Profiles get put on hold citing reasons like compensation without any discussion on it. This violates basic recruitment etiquettes of informing candidates on status and decisions in a timely transparent manner.
### Prevalent Issue Across Many Candidates  
Such experiences of zero post-interview follow ups, conduct of fake interviews and non-responsiveness of HR have been faced by multiple individuals, suggesting it could be a wider unaddressed problem within Accenture's recruitment management.
## Over-Promise and Under-Deliver Culture  
From shared insights, it seems Accenture follows a tendency to over-promise during initial hiring stages but fails to deliver as the process moves ahead.
### Raising False Hopes 
Mails congratulating clearing interviews and reassuring of further update raise high expectations but the same are never fulfilled. This misleads job seekers.
### Inability to Meet Commitments
Despite assurances of contacting soon with next steps, the recruiters do not take any actions as guaranteed. Constant delays and lack of timely response portray non-serious approach.
### Poor Tracking of Candidate Journey
It is apparent that Accenture lacks efficient applicant tracking mechanisms. Profiles seem to get lost in process with recruiters losing track of commitments made. This dissatisfies potential hires.
### Damages Company Brand Perception  
Such practices damage Accenture's employer branding. Negative publicity through forums impacts future candidates who then avoid applying to the organization. It is essential to honor given words to attract top talent.
## Reasons for Such Behavior
There could be multiple reasons leading to unprofessionalism in Accenture's recruitment practices.
### High Volume and Scaled Process  
Handling huge applications volumes every month due to the scale may result in loss of personal touch. Profiles are just numbers rather than individuals.
### Lack of Accountability Culture  
Absence of fixing responsibility allows recruiters to behave irresponsibly without consequences. Commitments made are neglected.  
### Inefficient HR Systems  
Outdated applicant tracking solutions possibly unable to effectively manage end-to-end candidate journey might be a cause. 
### Unclear Role Delineation  
Ambiguity in defining individual recruiter roles and responsibilities could lead to passing buck and delay in work allocation.
### Prioritizing Quantities over Quality
Emphasis on meeting hiring targets rather than creating positive candidate experiences may be the driving force.
## Fixing the Root Causes is Crucial
For long term gains, Accenture needs a cultural transformation focusing on quality and accountability.
### Overhauling Recruitment Technology  
Upgrading to advanced ATS integrating all functions will provide a single source of updated status.
### Establishing SLA-Based Workflow  
Defining clear Service Level Agreements for recruiters and linking performance to it will ensure commitments are honored. 
### Decentralizing Hiring Teams  
Small localized teams having end-to-end responsibility rather than just phases can personalize interactions.
### Reinforcing Candidate-First Mindset  
Shifting priority to creating best applicant experiences from high volume hiring alone is vital.  
### Ensuring Transparency in Communication  
Regular status updates and informative rejections will enhance transparency and trust with candidates.
## Conclusion
In the competitive talent market, creating a positive employer brand is crucial for attraction and retention. Accenture needs urgent reforms in recruitment management focusing on efficiency, accountability and candidate- centricity to restore faith in their hiring processes. Only then they can expect to source high caliber candidates efficiently.
