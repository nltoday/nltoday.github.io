When results for my 10th grade board exams were announced, I was in disbelief. Thanks to the support and guidance of my math teacher, I scored 88% after having given up hope of passing. Here is my story in parts:
### Poor Pre-Board Results Brought Disappointment 
My pre-board exams results shocked my parents - I scored only 38% without even attempting all subjects. My class teacher publicly challenged my mom that he would resign if I scored over 60%. Mom was distraught while I dismissed it as empty threats.

### Father's Anger Made Me Determined to Improve
At home, dad was furious after seeing my results. As a child, he would discipline me regularly so I braced for his reaction. His scolding that day was worse than ever, fueling my resolve to prove them wrong.
### Trip to Agra Came at the Right Time
Just days before my board exams started, I had convinced my parents to let me join their trip to Agra for a wedding. The 10-day break recharged me mentally away from home stress. I decided to make the most of this chance.
### Last-Minute Cramming With a Kind Teacher's Help  
With exams two days away on our return, I sought help from my school's [math teacher](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cow-mom-cute-womens-70s-80s-retro-style-sunset-moo-moo-lover-v-neck-t-shirt/men&). He calmly guided me to review questions from each chapter and sample papers. I followed his **test-taking strategies** for 10 hours daily at his home free of cost.
### Rushed to the First Exam Barely on Time
On exam day, oversleeping made me rush on my scooty recklessly to reach in time. Midway I realized forgetting my admit card but somehow managed to appear. Phew! That was a close shave.
### Scoring 88% Left Me and Mom in Disbelief  
When results showed 88%, neither of us could believe it. Mom was sure some error had occurred, dismissing it as beyond my abilities. I hurried to share the news with my helping teacher.
### Teacher's Pride Fueled My Success and Growth  
Seeing my teacher's smile of joy gave me a high. That day, I learnt the power of courage, hard work, good guidance, and quality over quantity while preparing. I hope you too can overcome all odds like I did. Work smart and success will follow!
