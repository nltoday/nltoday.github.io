### Getting Some Space 
After a breakup with a narcissist, it's natural to want some space and time alone to process your thoughts and emotions. However, the narcissist will not take the breakup kindly and will try various tactics to regain control. They may initially give you some distance but will soon start stalking your social media to see what you're up to and figure out ways to creep back into your life. As their ego start tormenting them that you have moved on, they will ramp up their efforts to get a reaction from you.

### The First Contact
When they see that you are not crawling back to them as they expected, the narcissist will make their first contact. They will [like photos on social media](https://store.fi.io.vn/dachshund-wiener-dog-i-love-dachshund-cute-animal-tees-63-doxie-dog-1) or send a short message, hoping for an easy re-entry. But when you don't reply, their torment intensifies. Feeling angry and defeated that their power over you is gone, the narcissist will message more persistently, desperately seeking the relief of getting a response from you. It doesn't matter what you say - they just need the ego boost of knowing they still have some influence. 
### Escalating Tactics
If ignoring their messages does not work, the narcissist will ramp up their tactics in increasingly manipulative ways. They may **propose getting back together** or tell exaggerated stories about being ill to invoke an emotional response. When further ignored, threats and intimidation may follow, as your lack of reaction tortures their fragile ego. The narcissist is now solely focused on you as the source of their distress, unable to sleep as their smallness and lack of control sinks in. You hold the power to define how quickly they can regain their dominance.
### Appealing to Emotion
Seeing logic and reasons will not work on you anymore, the narcissist turns to emotional manipulation. They may dredge up **fond memories from your relationship** or **profess undying love** to chip away at your resolve. Claiming no one understands or cares for them like you did, they hope old feelings resurface and blind you from their true nature. Should this approach bear no fruit, their mask will start to crack as narcissistic injury mounts. Expect anger, accusations, and threats to force your compliance. 
### Cutting Off Supply
When all strategies fail and you remain unyielding, the narcissist hits a desperate point. Having lost all perceived power and control over you, they must find new ways to regain supply. So they will promise radical changes just for another chance while simultaneously vowing to never let you back in their life. This **cognitive dissonance** shows how disconnected they are from reality or self-awareness. With their tactics exhausted, going no contact may be the healthiest option for your recovery.
### Moving Past Obsession
After successfully cutting the narcissist out of your life, it is normal to still wonder how they are coping without their main source of supply. Resist this temptation, as giving them mental space retains their power over your well-being. Focus instead on ** personal growth** through introspection, support systems, and activities fulfilling for mind and soul. In time, with self-care and perseverance, you will undergo positive changes just like your abuser underwent painful losses. Recovery is a process - be patient and compassionate with yourself as you work towards genuine happiness.
### A Bright Future Ahead
Eventually, you reach a place where pondering the narcissist no longer serves you. You see clearly without biases or rose-tinted glasses, able to spot manipulation for what it is. While the trauma they inflicted cannot be undone, you emerge much wiser and stronger. Your newfound self-worth makes future relationships healthier. So let go of the past and look ahead - your potential is limitless when no longer shackled by toxic influences. This is how survivors thrive - by choosing life and opting out of the narcissist's games for good.
