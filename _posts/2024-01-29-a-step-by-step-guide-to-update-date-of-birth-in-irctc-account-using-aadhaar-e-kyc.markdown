### Understanding the Problem
One of the common issues faced by many IRCTC account holders is the inability to update their date of birth in their profile. Often, the date of birth displayed does not match the one on their official documents like Aadhaar card. This poses several problems like booking train tickets or availing discounts meant for certain age groups.

### Searching for a Solution
Initial attempts to contact the IRCTC customer support proved futile as the call waiting times were too long. This led me on a search to find an easier way to rectify this issue. Going through various online forums, I came across the option of using Aadhaar e-KYC verification process. This seemed promising as Aadhaar contained the authenticated date of birth details.
### Exploring the Aadhaar e-KYC Option  
The Aadhaar e-KYC verification is a simple one-minute process where the demographic details like name, date of birth and gender get auto-populated from the Aadhaar database once the 12-digit Aadhaar number is provided. However, it required the mobile number to be [linked with Aadhaar beforehand](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/abdi). Verifying this, I found my mobile number was indeed updated with Aadhaar. This gave me confidence to try the e-KYC route.
### Following the Step-by-Step Process
Logging into the IRCTC account, I navigated to the ‘Profile’ section and clicked on the 'Aadhaar KYC' option listed at the bottom. I entered my 12-digit Aadhaar number and received an OTP on the registered mobile number. Entering the OTP successfully completed the **Aadhaar e-KYC verification**. To my relief, the date of birth now correctly matched my Aadhaar details. The issue stood resolved within minutes without any hassles.
### Important Points to Note
A few points are important to keep in mind for others trying this process:
- Mobile number should be pre-linked with Aadhaar for receiving OTP  
- Fill details like name and date of birth exactly as in Aadhaar 
- Carefully enter the OTP received within few minutes of requesting
- Check profile again after verification to see updated DOB
### Conclusion
The Aadhaar e-KYC verification is a hassle-free single step process to automatically rectify the date of birth mismatch issue in IRCTC account. I am glad this **simple solution** helped me resolve the long pending problem without running from pillar to post. I hope this guide benefits others facing similar issues as well.
