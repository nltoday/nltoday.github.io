### The Benefits of Adding Your Games to Steam
Steam provides many benefits for gamers beyond just being a store to purchase titles. One great feature is the ability to add non-Steam games to your library, allowing you to conveniently launch them through Steam. This provides a centralized place to access all your games while also giving you access to Steam features like achievements, controller configuration, cloud saves, and more for those other games.
To add a non-Steam game, simply open Steam and click the "Add a Game" button in the bottom left corner. Browse your files to locate the executable of the game you want to add. You can even customize the name and set custom artwork to make it look nice alongside your other Steam games. **This "add non-Steam game" feature lets you organize all your game library in one place no matter where they were purchased or downloaded from.**
