## Changes in Higher Education due to the Pandemic  
With the rise of online learning during the Covid-19 pandemic, traditional in-person opportunities for students to interact with and get to know potential advisers have diminished. Office hours, research labs, and casual interactions around campus are now rare as most university functions have moved online. This new reality presents challenges for graduate students seeking mentors to guide their thesis work. However, with creativity and persistence, it is still possible to make meaningful connections with professors and find the right fit as an adviser.
### [Virtual Outreach and Communication](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/aguillon)
Rather than dropping by a professor's office or lab in person, students must now initiate contact virtually through email or video conferencing. A polite, well-written introductory message is key to opening the door for further discussion. Be sure to highlight your relevant background, interests aligning with the professor's research areas, and availability for a virtual meeting. Following up respectfully if no response is received can also help demonstrate your commitment and determination to find an adviser. Once a meeting is scheduled, come prepared to ask thoughtful questions and show your passion and suitability for the topic through engaged discussion online.

### **Demonstrating Dedication to the Subject Matter** 
For students pursuing a thesis in **computational linguistics** or another specialized field, it is important to convey passion and prior experience with the topic beyond just classroom learning. Highlight any relevant work, volunteer opportunities, or independent research you have undertaken so far to prove your motivation and suitability for a particular adviser's area of focus. Discuss ideas for potential thesis projects that could advance understanding of **natural language processing techniques**. Coming to the initial meeting armed with well-developed proposals displays initiative an adviser will appreciate.
### **Flexibility in Approach Given Changed Conditions**
The pandemic has greatly disrupted traditional modes of higher education, requiring flexibility from all involved. Emphasize in your outreach your ability to adapt to virtual collaboration tools and working independently when needed. Recognize that professors' priorities have also shifted and they have limited capacity for in-person meetings presently. Offer creative suggestions for how you can effectively begin laying the groundwork for future thesis work from a distance through online discussions, distributed tasks, and regular check-ins using technology. Demonstrating nimble problem-solving skills will assist in winning over a potential adviser. 
### **Preserving Personal Connections Despite Geographic Separation**
While face-to-face contact is minimized, personal touches can still foster meaningful adviser-student bonds from afar. Send a brief, personalized note by mail occasionally to maintain a human element to your digital correspondence. Inquire thoughtfully about an adviser's well-being and share updates on your progress to keep the relationship feeling collaborative rather than transactional. Look for virtual social events co-sponsored by faculty where informal chats may occur. Creatively leveraging technology allows preserving that vital personal connection critical to guidance even when separated by physical distance.
### **ongoing Reflection and Evaluation of Fit**  
No initial match with a thesis adviser will be perfect, so maintain an open mind and keep communicating your evolving goals. Reach out politely to multiple faculty members whose work aligns with your interests. Be prepared to reconsider options as the early stages of a project may bring unforeseen challenges or changes of heart. Discuss obstacles transparently with potential advisers and solicit advice on next steps. With diligent self-reflection on needs and preferences, and ongoing check-ins with mentors, the right fit will emerge for guiding a successful thesis even in unconventional times.
## Conclusion
Seeking a thesis adviser requires adaptability, assertiveness and perseverance even under normal circumstances. The transition to remote learning has added further layers of complexity but with creativity, flexibility and digital communication, graduate students can still make meaningful connections with faculty mentors. Demonstrating a strong work ethic, independent research skills and thoughtful personal touches helps offset lack of in-person interaction. By highlighting relevant experience and showing an ability to collaborate virtually, passionate students can absolutely find the right adviser to guide their graduate workâ€”even during a pandemic.
