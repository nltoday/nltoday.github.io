Modern Hebrew uses different terms than English to ask the five fundamental questions: who, what, where, when and why. Let's take a deeper dive into each question word and how they are used in the beautiful Hebrew language. 
### Pronouns in Hebrew
As in English, Hebrew has distinct pronouns to refer to people. The word for "who" is **מי (mi)**, which interestingly resembles the name for the note E. The pronoun for "he" is **הוא (hu)**, while "she" is **היא (hi)**. You may notice the similarity between the Hebrew and English pronouns - an amusing correlation worth noting!

### Asking "Who" in Hebrew 
To ask who in Hebrew, you use the word **מי (mi)**. However, there is a clever way to refer to someone undefined using **מישהו (mishahu)**, which combines **מי**, the interrogative **ש (sh)[ and a defective form of ](https://yt.io.vn/collection/ader)הוא (he)**. So **מישהו** literally means "**who** that **he** is", but is understood to mean "**someone**". 
For example:
**מישהו רוצה גלידה?** 
**Who (is the one that) wants ice cream?**
### The Question "What" in Hebrew
To ask what in Hebrew, you use **מה (ma)**. Like who, you can create the word for "**something**" by adding **שהו** to **מה**, resulting in **משהו**. 
You may have also noticed Hebrew utilizes **holes** or missing vowels effectively. The word **מה** is a great example, as prolonging the **"ah"** sound creates the laidback way to ask "**what's up**" or "**how are you**" in casual speech.
### Asking "Where" in Hebrew
The Hebrew word for where is **איפה (efo)**. This combines **איה** ("where") with **פה** ("here") to literally mean "where here". 
Notice the tricky **holem** vowel after the peh, turning the ending vowel sound to **"oh"** instead of **"ah"**. In practice, both **efo** and **eyfo** are used depending on dialect.
To refer to a location, you can use **איפה** with **שהו** to say **איפשהו** meaning "**somewhere**".
### Asking "When" in Hebrew 
To ask when in Hebrew, the word used is **מתי (matay)**. Like the other question words, you can combine it with **שהו** to reply **מתישהו**, meaning "**sometime**" or **"eventually**".
### The Question "Why" in Hebrew
To ask why in Hebrew, the word is **למה (lama)**. This is a combination of **מה** ("what") with the prefix **ל־** ("to" or "for"), literally meaning "for what". 
Remember, all languages have quirks - don't focus on word-for-word translations. Asking **למה** is simply the Hebrew way to ask "why".
### Asking "How" in Hebrew
Finally, to ask how in Hebrew you use **איך (eikh)**. The **kh** sound here is light, avoiding an unwieldy diphthong. 
Colloquially, **איך** is often shortened further to just **ech**. So whether you say **eikh** or **ech**, you now know the word for how in Hebrew!
### Conversational Hebrew Phrases 
By combining the question words with **שהו**, you quickly pick up some useful conversational phrases. Here are a few examples:
- **מישהו רוצה קפה?** - **Anyone want coffee?**
- **יש משהו חדש?** - **Is there anything new?** 
- **איפשהו טוב לאכול?** - **Anywhere good to eat?**
- **מתישהו בשבוע הבא?** - **Sometime next week?**
