## The Evolution of Netflix Streaming on iPad
Netflix has come a long way in terms of streaming capabilities on iPads over the years. While an app is still needed for the best experience, newer iPads running iPadOS 13 now have some new options. Let's explore how Netflix streaming on iPads has evolved.
### Early Limitations of Streaming on iPad
In the early days of Netflix streaming, iPads faced some limitations that prevented browsing and streaming directly from the website. As tablets, iPads weren't considered full desktop browsers. They also lacked support for Adobe Flash, which was widely used for video at the time. This meant the only way to access Netflix was through a dedicated app.

### New Possibilities with iPadOS 13 and Safari 
However, things have changed with the release of iPadOS 13 and improvements to the Safari browser. iPadOS 13 introduced a new "Request Desktop Site" option that allows iPads to access the full desktop version of websites. At the same time, Safari gained features that make it a more capable desktop-style browser. With these changes, iPads running the latest software can now [identify as Mac computers to streaming services](https://yt.io.vn/collection/allain). This new capability allows **direct streaming of Netflix through the Safari browser** rather than requiring the dedicated app.
## Streaming Netflix Directly in Safari 
While the app still provides the best experience, Safari browsing enables some new flexibility. Services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video will now play video content directly inside the browser. This opens up new options without needing to download separate apps. 
### Compatibility with Desktop-Optimized Websites
By identifying as a desktop browser, the iPad can now access the full desktop versions of streaming sites. These are optimized for larger screens with keyboard/mouse input rather than touch-based mobile versions. Videos play at higher resolutions in a larger player without needing to be compressed for mobile.
### Browsing, Searching and Streaming All in One
Staying within Safari allows for a seamless browsing and streaming experience. Users can search for shows and movies directly from the Netflix homepage, then watch their selections immediately without interruption. Everything plays out smoothly within the same browser interface.
## Considerations When Streaming in Safari
While Safari streaming works well, there are still some advantages to using dedicated streaming apps on the latest iPads. Here are a few factors to consider:
### Improved Touch-Based Interfaces 
As mobile apps, streaming services are optimized for touch input with intuitive interfaces. Safari may require more clicks and taps compared to apps built specifically for tablets. 
### Quick Access with App Icons
Jumping directly into apps from the home screen is often quicker than launching Safari and browsing to sites. Apps also allow background streaming not possible in a browser.
### Offline Viewing with Downloads 
Many streaming apps let users download content to watch offline, while browsing the library in Safari requires an internet connection. Downloads are perfect for viewing on planes or without WiFi.
### Superior Photo/Screen Quality
While Safari plays video at higher resolutions, apps are still tuned specifically for high-quality screens on iPads. They may produce even clearer images.
## Choosing the Right Experience 
In conclusion, **the latest iPads give users more choice** in how they access services like Netflix. For casual browsing and streaming, Safari works well. But for die-hard fans and those wanting the absolute best experience, dedicated streaming apps still offer key advantages even on iPadOS 13 devices. In the end, it comes down to each individual's priorities and needs.
