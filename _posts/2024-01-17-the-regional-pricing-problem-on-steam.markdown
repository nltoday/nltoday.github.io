### How Regional Pricing Works on Steam
Steam implements regional pricing for games sold on its platform in order to make gaming more affordable and accessible for users in regions with lower average incomes and weaker currencies. Games are priced lower in these regions compared to prices in countries like the United States. For example, a $60 AAA game may cost the equivalent of only $30-40 in a country like Russia. **This allows more gamers in lower-income countries to enjoy blockbuster titles without breaking the bank.** 
However, regional pricing is not without issues. To prevent abuses of the system, Steam implements region locks on game keys and CD keys. A key activated in Russia cannot be used on an account registered in the United States, and vice versa. **This geo-blocking system aims to ensure each region pays the appropriate regional price based on location.**

### Black Market Resales Lead to Account Theft 
Unfortunately, [unscrupulous vendors found ways to profit by circumventing regional pricing restrictions](https://store.fi.io.vn/dear-person-behind-me-you-look-great-today). Rather than reselling keys, these individuals began creating throwaway Steam accounts using virtual private networks (VPNs) and stolen payment details. Games would be purchased on these fake accounts using regional currencies with deeply discounted prices. **The full Steam accounts were then listed for resale on black market storefronts at prices slightly below USD prices.**
By purchasing a pre-loaded Steam account from these stores, buyers could access a library of games at regional prices without restriction. Of course, the original account owners were often stolen through credential theft or phishing scams. **This illegal trade proliferated, undermining the intent of regional pricing policies while also endangering consumers.**
### Steam Account Security Becomes a Higher Priority
As account theft worsened, Steam support teams were inundated with hacked account recovery requests. **Valve realized it needed improved security measures to curb stolen credentials from fueling the booming black market.** Two-factor authentication (2FA) was gradually enforced on all accounts, requiring additional verification beyond a password. **2FA makes it much more difficult for bad actors to simply guess or phish login details.**
Regional pricing opponents argued this black market activity showed the policy was unworkable. **However, most experts agreed lax security, not regional differences, enabled bad behavior.** By hardening account protections with 2FA, Steam believed it could continue its mission of expanding gaming reach while also protecting customers. **The longer-term impact of these changes remains to be seen.**
### Regional Players Fear Loss of Discounts 
As news spread of the account theft ring, some gamers in lower-income regions grew fearful **Valve might reactionarily drop regional pricing altogether.** For many, inflated "international" pricing would mean returning to piracy since legally purchasing games became unaffordable. **Dropping regional discounts risked depriving legit customers to solve problems not primarily of their making.**
Others proposed region-locking gameplay itself to IP addresses, blocking access when away from home. But this too was heavy-handed, punishing all customers for actions of criminals. **Overall, most saw account security as the best solution—curbing theft without marginalizing whole userbases.** Whether Steam found the right approach remains up for debate.
### A Balancing Act Continues 
Steam faced a **difficult challenge of upholding fair pricing worldwide without enabling abuse.** Its initial regional pricing model provided access but lacked proper safeguards. **By hardening account security with 2FA, it aims to shut down the black market while keeping discounts intact.** Time will tell if this equilibrium can be sustained, or if further measures are needed.
For now, both players and developers hope the policy accomplishes its original vision—expanding the reach of PC gaming globally by balancing affordability with protecting legitimate customers. But as with any system, **weak points will be tested, requiring an ongoing effort to innovate security while upholding egalitarian ideals.** The balancing act of regional pricing on Steam continues.
