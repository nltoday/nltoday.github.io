## Is It Possible to Know If Someone Has Blocked You?
Discord doesn't directly tell users if they have been blocked. However, there are a few reliable ways to check your blocked status. The first is by attempting to send a direct message. If you receive Clyde's standard message stating you don't share a server or have direct messaging disabled, it's highly likely you've been blocked. 
Another method is trying to react to one of the user's messages. **If the reaction appears instantly, you aren't blocked. But if the reaction button shakes without adding the reaction, you've most likely been placed on their block list.** Both of these techniques have been used by the Discord community for some time to determine blocking without Discord confirming it directly.
## Understanding the Different Reasons for Clyde's Message
Clyde's standard response mentioning not sharing a server or having direct messages turned off isn't only given when being blocked. **There are a few other potential causes for seeing this message besides having a user block you.** 
The recipient could have their privacy settings configured to only allow direct messages from friends. Or on shared servers between the two accounts, the recipient may have direct messages from server members disabled in their settings. So while the Clyde message is frustrating, it doesn't outright confirm being blocked in every case. 
## Using the Reaction Method for Absolute Clarity 
When trying to determine if someone specifically has you blocked, the reaction method is the most definitive way. As explained earlier, attempting to react to one of their messages provides a clear visual indicator of your blocked status.
If the reaction goes through instantly, you know for certain you aren't blocked by that user. But if the reaction button shakes without adding the reaction, it proves beyond any doubt that you are on their block list. This makes the reaction test the only completely reliable technique.
## Why Discord Isn't More Direct About Blocking 
The company takes a more subtle approach to notifying users about being blocked as opposed to an explicit message. There are a few possible reasons for this design decision by Discord.
Firstly, directly telling someone they've been placed on a block list could hurt feelings or cause frustration. **By using a neutral message like Clyde's response instead, it avoids assigning blame or creating conflict.** Discord also likely wants to maintain privacy around blocking to some extent. A discreet approach keeps the blocked user from knowing for certain who specifically blocked them.
Overall, the reaction method combined with Clyde's standard response allows users to verify blocking without Discord hurting sensitivities or compromising privacy. It fulfills the purpose while balancing multiple considerations in a thoughtful manner.
## Learning When To Block And When To Be Understanding
Initially, the author of this story blocked users liberally for annoyances like inappropriate comments. However, they've realized blocking longterm for minor issues isn't always the best approach. Now, they tend to let exchanges play out first before blacklisting accounts permanently. 
At the same time, truly egregious behavior like openly **racist remarks or having racially charged profile pictures still warrant an immediate block.** The line has to be drawn somewhere to maintain a respectful community. With experience, it becomes easier to differentiate minor annoyances from significant violations deserving of blocking. 
While occasional "interesting" users with extreme views may temporarily slip through, their activity will eventually lead to a ban as demonstrated in this example. Overall, blocking selectively and giving some leeway appears to achieve a healthy balance between open discussion and monitoring unacceptable conduct on Discord.
## Wrapping Up Discussions on Blocking Etiquette 
In conclusion, there are constructive ways both as an individual and a platform to thoughtfully handle blocking. Discord established a balanced approach through their non-direct notifications and verification techniques. As users, blocking liberally at the first sign of trouble often isn't the answer either. 
With experience, most learn when minor issues can be tolerated versus clear violations warranting more serious consequences. At the same time, safety has to take priority over absolute openness if needed. By handling blocking judiciously yet consistently enforcing bans when crossed, communities can maintain civility overall on Discord.
