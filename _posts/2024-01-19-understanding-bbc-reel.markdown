### A New Video Destination
BBC Reel is the new online video platform from the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) focused on short documentary and premium video content. While the BBC is best known internationally for its television channels and radio stations, BBC Reel marks the organization's effort to bring together all of its diverse video offerings under one digital destination. 
The site aims to collect videos from across the BBC's multiple brands and channels, including BBC Three, BBC Four, BBC World News, and BBC Scotland. BBC Reel publishes new commissioned videos on a daily basis focused on interesting themes and topics. Each day, a new themed playlist curated by BBC Reel's six-person editorial team highlights one special newly produced video alongside evergreen content from the BBC archives.

### Targeting an Educated Global Audience
BBC Reel targets a sophisticated global audience hungry for intelligent, thought-provoking videos on diverse subjects. From exploring insights into the human mind and psyche to uncovering secret worlds across the planet through documentary filmmaking, BBC Reel provides viewers with unique perspectives and concepts sure to spark new ideas and inspire change. 
Rather than short entertainment clips or viral videos, BBC Reel focuses on producing and sharing in-depth, educational mini-documentaries averaging 7-15 minutes in length. Topics range from science and technology to arts, culture and history. The site also offers a selection of short-form videos 2-5 minutes long giving quick introductions to complex subjects or profiles of important figures.  
### Origins in BBC's Video Archives
While BBC Reel marks a new centralized digital home for BBC-produced videos, the organization has a long history of innovative video content production across its brands. The term "reel" itself has multiple meanings derived from film and television production. Originally, a "reel" referred to the cylindrical containers films were wound onto for storage and playback. 
Today, BBC Reel's name plays on the traditional meaning while also nodding to one of the site's core purposes - giving new life to evergreen videos from the BBC archives. Each day's curated playlist prominently features one specially commissioned new video but also includes multiple related archived videos to provide deeper context. In this way, BBC Reel breathes new viewership into content that remains highly relevant but risks being forgotten amid the overflow of new online videos.
### Broad Appeal While Honoring BBC Tradition  
By centralizing the BBC's diverse video holdings, BBC Reel aims to make the organization's award-winning documentary and factual programming more accessible to global audiences online. At the same time, the platform remains devoted to the BBC's public service mission of educating and informing international viewers. 
BBC Reel sequences full-length mini-documentaries and short-form videos into digestible daily playlists anchored around compelling themes. This structure ensures something unique and interesting for every taste while maintaining the BBC's high production values and journalistic standards. With insightful videos on topics from science to society, BBC Reel brings the best of British factual broadcasting to a new generation of global online viewers.
### Focus on Engaging Storytelling
Above all, BBC Reel is committed to engaging global audiences through the art of storytelling. Whether exploring mind-bending scientific discoveries, probing intriguing social issues or transporting viewers to far-flung destinations, each BBC Reel video weaves a captivating narrative. Skilled documentary filmmakers combine evocative images with insightful interviews and informative narration to draw viewers deep into their subject matter.
The destination's daily playlists group videos by universal themes guaranteed to spark curiosity, such as human relationships, cultural traditions or technological breakthroughs. In this way, BBC Reel taps into viewers' innate desires to learn more about the world and better understand our complex reality through compelling factual stories. Whether spreading awareness of urgent global challenges or simply satisfying viewers' sense of wanderlust, BBC Reel aims to both educate and enthral audiences around the planet.
