## An Overview of Class Sizes and Participating Companies  
ISB has consistently attracted large class sizes for its Post Graduate Program (PGP). From 2014 to 2022, class sizes ranged between 770 to 929 students, demonstrating high demand for the program. Though the 2023 class size dipped slightly to 865 students, it remains one of the largest two-year MBA programs globally.
The number of companies participating in campus recruitments, an indicator of demand for ISB graduates, has also varied over the years. Between 2014 and 2022, participating companies fluctuated from 267 to 433. While the 2022 number fell to 222 companies, this was likely due to the impact of the pandemic on recruiting. Overall, both class sizes and participating companies demonstrate sustained interest in ISB's program.
