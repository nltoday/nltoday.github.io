### Understanding VRAM
Graphics processors require memory to store textures, shader programs and other graphics data for processing and display. This memory is known as video RAM, or VRAM. Discrete graphics cards have their own dedicated VRAM, separate from system RAM. However, integrated graphics solutions embedded directly onto the CPU die must use a portion of system RAM as VRAM. 
The amount of VRAM available impacts graphics performance. More VRAM allows more textures and data to be stored and quickly accessed by the graphics processor. Games and applications may struggle or fail to run if insufficient VRAM is allocated to the integrated graphics processor. Fortunately, most modern operating systems allow adjusting the amount of system RAM allocated as VRAM.

### Identifying Integrated Graphics
The first step is determining if a system uses integrated or discrete graphics. On pre-built systems, there will be no additional graphics card installed - the video ports will be connected directly to the motherboard. Device manager can also confirm if only basic onboard/integrated video is present. Alternatively, opening the computer case covers and looking for an add-in graphics card via an PCI Express x16 slot provides a visual check.
### Locating VRAM Settings 
Once integrated graphics are confirmed, the BIOS or UEFI firmware must be entered to adjust the VRAM allocation. Restart the system and look for accessing the BIOS during post - often with a key like Delete, F2 or Esc. Navigating to an [Advanced](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/chihuahua-lover) or **Integrated Peripherals** menu will reveal graphics-related options. Here the amount of system RAM allocated to VRAM can typically be increased or decreased.
### Testing Higher VRAM Amounts
Increasing allocated VRAM is not a guaranteed fix, but is worth experimenting with. Start by allocating 128MB or 256MB more and test **graphically demanding games**. Monitor performance differences - increased frame rates or reduced stuttering could mean the title now has sufficient VRAM. Further increases may yield better results still, up to a point where diminishing returns set in. Once stable operation is confirmed, save BIOS settings and exit.
### Troubleshooting Non-Responses 
If adjusting allocated VRAM yields no observable changes, the integrated graphics processor may simply lack the performance needed. Ensure any necessary drivers are installed from the computer or motherboard manufacturer's website. Overheating could also cause odd issues - check fans and airflow are not obstructed. As a last resort, try rolling back BIOS settings to factory defaults in case of corruption. Persistent problems may require a dedicated graphics card upgrade.
### Improving General Performance 
While VRAM increases focus on graphics, non-gaming system responsiveness benefits too. Enabling hardware acceleration features in browsers utilizes integrated graphics for tasks like scrolling and video playback. Clearing desktop clutter and disabling unnecessary startup programs reduces burden on system resources. For everyday productivity, allocating 256MB-512MB VRAM provides good balancing of performance versus other hardware demands.
### When a Dedicated Card is Best
The limitations of integrated graphics become more apparent with demanding **AAA gaming titles**. While older or less graphics-intensive games can still be playable on integrated solutions with sufficient VRAM, a discrete graphics card will always outperform onboard options. Anyone serious about high-quality, high-framerate gaming should consider upgrading to a dedicated graphics card, even a basic budget model, whenever system upgrades allow. This dedicated VRAM ensures optimal graphics performance for years to come.
