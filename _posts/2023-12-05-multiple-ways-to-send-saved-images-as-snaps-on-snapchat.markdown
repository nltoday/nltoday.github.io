### Uploading Filters 
Snapchat offers various uploading filters that allow users to send photos from their camera roll as snaps. Users can browse for these filters by going to the 'Browse' section and searching terms like 'camera roll' or 'upload'. [Popular camera roll uploading filters](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-but-psycho-bae-darling-crazy-girlfriend-t-shirt/men&) typically feature a hand making a photo frame gesture with arrows pointing left and right. Once the desired filter is applied, users can select an image from their camera roll to overlay onto the snap. By taking a picture as normal, the snap containing the saved photo can then be sent to contacts.

### Using the 'Remix Snap' Feature
Another native Snapchat function for incorporating saved images is the 'Remix Snap' option. When viewing a photo from your camera roll or memories, the three dot menu in the top right allows users to choose 'Remix Snap'. Selecting the first remix style, typically a smiling emoji face, edits only the eyes and mouth onto the imported photo. By tilting the camera away slightly, the edited features disappear, leaving the original saved photo. Users can then take a snapshot and send the image as a new snap instead of a chat. The 'Remix Snap' method provides a creative way to share memorable photos without additional uploading filters.
### Sending via the Camera Roll 
For those wanting a simpler approach, saving photos to the device camera roll first allows snapping and sharing from within the Snapchat app. Users select the desired photo from their camera roll or memories section, similar to picking an image for Instagram or Facebook stories. Instead of posting, pressing the capture button treats the photo like a live snap, enabling distribution to contacts. While not embedding filters, directly accessing photos already on the phone offers a straightforward technique. However, to avoid quality loss, it's best saving images at their original high resolution before sending as camera roll snaps on Snapchat.
### Combining Methods for Variety
Creative Snapchat users wanting to showcase different photos have the option to mix uploading filters, 'Remix Snap' edits and direct camera roll sharing. For example, applying a theme-based filter to specific photos, then remixing others with arty effects before simply snap-capturing additional images. Following each part with a brief message provides context. Combining the multiple methods within a story-style compilation allows for visual variety. Formatting cohesive multi-part snaps takes more planning but provides a full picture when the recipient views the story-timeline of snaps as a complete creative work.
### Using Screen Recording 
For those wanting to post full screen captures of images, videos or app content as snaps, screen recording first on the device then sharing can work. However, be aware that Snapchat and other apps may detect unauthorized recording within their interfaces. An alternative is to screen record content meant for close friends and family by sending individually after recording rather than to a Story. As with uploading filters or remixing, the captured screen recording treat like a live snap for distribution. Proper permission from copyright holders must also be obtained when screen capturing and sharing third party content or images through any social media platform like Snapchat.
### Summary 
In summary, Snapchat offers built-in options like uploading filters, 'Remix Snap' editing and direct camera roll access for creatively incorporating saved images and photos into snaps. Users have flexibility in choosing to apply filters, edit images or simply select from their camera roll depending on the desired look and feel. For achieving visual variety in multi-snap posts, combining the different methods provides greater creative options than relying on only one approach. Screen recording content first then sending individually can also work but requires discretion. With practice, Snapchat users can discover which photo sharing techniques best match their artistic styles and storytelling abilities on the platform.
