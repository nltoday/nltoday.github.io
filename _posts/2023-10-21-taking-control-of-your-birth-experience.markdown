### Establishing Boundaries
My husband wants his mother and father to see me naked, sweaty, bloody, extremely hormonal and rude, and quite possibly pooping myself right there on the table?! Tell him to get real. Labor is not pretty - it's a lot of hard, nasty work which is why it's called labor. I will be putting in a [tremendous amount of physical effort](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/dachshund) to bring our child into the world. This is no spectator sport.

### Seeking Support from Your Doctor
It's time to take control and establish clear boundaries. Tell your doctor exactly who you want in the delivery room. Make a **thorough access list** of those allowed. The nurses will run interference and keep unwanted people out if needed. It can just be you and medical personnel if you want - not even my husband has an automatic right to be there unless I approve. This day is about **my needs and the health of our baby**. 
### Gaining Back Autonomy 
My husband sounds extremely **self-absorbed and thoughtless**. But even narcissists care about offspring as extensions of themselves, so help him understand how **my comfort directly impacts baby's safety**. Giving birth is difficult - I need every comfort and support I desire. If he won't respect my wishes, I'll ask my doctor to explain my rights at my next appointment. This situation is too serious to ignore. Added stress could **endanger mom and baby**. When laboring, it has to be all about me.
### Enlisting Doctor's Help 
Rather than argue, I'll transfer responsibility for boundaries onto my doctor. After me, the doctor and staff have total authority over the delivery room, not my husband. I'll request my OBGYN become the **"bad guy"** - I know they'll gladly assist. They can inform my husband, due to some medical reason, only the baby's parents are allowed in. If needed, the doctor will eject my husband too. This spares me stress while **blaming the decision on hospital policy**. Delivery isn't a spectator sport - I want only the support I need. 
### Maintaining Composure
Staying calm is critical for a safe birth experience. I can't let my husband's selfish behavior cause **undue stress or anxiety**. If all else fails, I'll keep repeating that **my wishes alone dictate my delivery**. When contractions start, I may not feel able to argue - nurses and doctors must enforce my previously stated boundaries. This day is about **my empowerment as a woman** bringing new life into the world. I cannot let others make me feel vulnerable or out of control in my most personal moment.
### Finding Inner Strength
Giving life is a miracle but also tremendously taxing physically and emotionally. In the challenging hours ahead, I must tap into my inner strength reserves. **Positive affirmations** will bolster my spirit - this is my body's incredible capability on display. Though I ache and strain, each contraction propels me and baby closer to meeting. Supportive staff by my side will cheer my efforts, but my strength comes from within. I will greet new dawn **empowered through this test of feminine power**.
### Welcoming Our Bundle of Joy 
After arduous work, our little one's first cries ring out, sweet music that makes it all worthwhile. Exhausted but euphoric, I behold our angel sent to bring joy. Previous troubles fade against sublime love welling in my heart at our miracle's tiny perfection. My beloved enters, eyes wet seeing creation of our bond. Doctor congratulates my brilliant achievements, all by **my superhuman effort alone**. At long last, I relax into soothing aftermath knowing one battle's won and sweet future with this gift begins.
