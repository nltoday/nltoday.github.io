### Immigration Process  
Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (SHIA) sees thousands of passengers passing through its gates daily. The international arrival terminal has between 8-10 [immigration booths](https://yt.io.vn/collection/ahmadi), with 2 express lanes for dignitaries or business class passengers. Immigration queues rarely last more than 15 minutes as the officers are efficient, clearing passengers within 30 seconds if documents are in order. ASEAN passport holders have the benefit of obtaining a **visa on arrival** with little waiting time required.

### Baggage Claim Hassles
However, the baggage claim process is where passengers often face delays and frustration. With only one baggage carousel that tends to move slowly, it can take up to an hour just to reunite with checked luggage. This is further exacerbated when multiple large aircraft disembark passengers simultaneously. The sparse number of **baggage claim belts** results in lost or misplaced bags quite frequently. Passengers are advised to pack as **carry-on luggage** to avoid such hassles. 
### Choosing the Right Terminal 
SHIA consists of three terminals - Terminal 1 serving low cost carriers, Terminal 2 for international flights and Terminal 3 handling full service flights. Terminal 1 is best avoided due to overcrowding and poor facilities. **AirAsia and Garuda** using Terminals 2 and 3 offer a smoother travel experience with their **spacious terminals** and dedicated business lounges.
### Domestic Connecting Flight Woes
For domestic connecting passengers, allow ample time between flights. The vast distances between terminals combined with scarce transport options often cause passengers to miss connections. It is advisable to book at least a 3 hour layover for peace of mind.  
### Recommended Carriers
When considering **domestic flights**, opt for Garuda, Lion Air or Citilink operating from the less crowded Terminals 2 and 3. Avoid Terminal 1 assigned carriers at all costs to save yourself from unnecessary hassle and stress.  
### Travel Assistance Programs 
Carriers like **Garuda Indonesia** take customer experience very seriously. Their international business class passengers receive airport guidance and expedited immigration through a private **immigration lane**. Travel becomes a breeze with airport representatives constantly attentive to passenger needs.
### Post-Arrival Transport 
Public transport options from the airport are limited. The Damri bus is the most economical but infrequent. Grabbing a taxi is convenient albeit on the expensive side. Ride-hailing services like Grab or Gojek provide a **good airport transfer alternative**. Factoring in traffic conditions, these typically reach the airport in 30-45 minutes.
In conclusion, with proper planning on **visa requirements, flight carriers, terminals, transportation arrangements** and adequate time buffers, navigating SHIA need not be an ordeal. Sticking to the recommended carriers and following suggested tips helps ensure a hassle-free airport experience. Despite room for improvement, SHIA facilities and services are a huge step-up from the nightmare that is Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport. With continued revamps, SHIA promises to only get better.
