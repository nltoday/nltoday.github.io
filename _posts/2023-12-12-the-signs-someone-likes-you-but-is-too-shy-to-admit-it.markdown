As humans, we all experience emotions like attraction and shyness in different ways. Recognizing when someone is interested but too timid to express it can help avoid misunderstandings. Here are some common hints to look out for.
### Staring Glances and Quickly Looking Away
An obvious sign is catching them stealing glances at you from across the room. **However, never holding your gaze when you catch their eye**. If you think they're looking at your direction, subtly glance over. If they abruptly turn away, it's possible they were looking at you. Keep an eye out for this body language. 
It takes confidence to maintain eye contact when noticed looking. For shy people, breaking the stare is a defense mechanism to avoid embarrassment. But it also gives away their interest since they couldn't help sneaking looks in the first place.

### Finding Reasons to Be Near You
Another hint is them making an effort to regularly be in your vicinity. Yet they act like you don't exist when you're right there. It seems contradictory, but makes sense for shy romantic interests. 
They want to be close enough to observe and admire you from afar. But proximity also brings anxiety of having to interact. So they pretend you're not really there to spare themselves the discomfort of confronting feelings directly.
### Acting Differently Around You
Take note if their behaviour changes significantly in your presence compared to with others. A shy admirer tries to act normal around their crush. But nerves often cause them to clam up or behave oddly versus when relaxing with friends. 
Their tension translates to coming across aloof or cold. While inside, their **heart is racing with anticipation every time they're near you**. Noticing these contrasts can provide clues to their true feelings below the surface.
### Missing Social Cues  
Part of shyness involves impaired social skills during moments of high anxiety. So watch for misses in basic courtesy expected from others. For example, not making eye contact when you greet them or avoiding simple conversation.
Their mind goes blank near you as attraction throws off logical thinking. It's not rudeness, just an inability to function normally due to flustered emotions. Give leeway for minor social faux pas that wouldn't excuse indifference from confident people.
### Covertly Finding Out About You  
Take note if they start asking casual questions about your interests, past, opinions on random topics. A shy crush wants more insights into their secret admirer through [covert information gathering](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-sunflower-you-are-my-world-shirt-chihuahua-lovers-female-tshirt-dog-themed-gifts3549-t-shirt).  
Directly inquiring comes with rejection risks. So indirect probing feels safer to gain understanding and look for compatibility signs without revealing their intent. Watch for increased subtle queries that serve no real purpose other than learning more about you.
### They're Anxious When You're Away
Now pay attention to how they act when you're absent versus present. A shy admirer constantly glances around hoping to spot you. But the moment you appear, the nervous floundering resumes. 
Your lack of presence relaxes their worries temporarily. But uncertainty eats away until seeing you again, even if it causes distress. Recognizing these contrasts in behavior depending on your whereabouts reveals someone dwelling on you quietly from afar.
In conclusion, shyness manifests in nuanced ways difficult for outsiders to interpret. But looking out for repetitive hints in the listed areas offers clues to pick up subtle signs of attraction from someone too timid to confess directly. With patience and understanding, their feelings slowly come to light.
