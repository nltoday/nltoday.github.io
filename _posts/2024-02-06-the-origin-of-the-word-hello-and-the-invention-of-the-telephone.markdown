Alexander Graham Bell is widely known as the inventor of the telephone. However, there are several myths surrounding the first telephone call and the origin of the word "hello". Let's break down the facts behind these stories.
### The First Call Was Not to "Hello"
It is often claimed that during Bell's first call using his telephone invention in 1876, he said "hello" to his assistant Thomas Watson in the next room. However, this story is false. According to historical records, **Bell's actual first words over the telephone were "Mr. Watson, come here, I want to see you"** when calling out to Watson. At the time, Bell did not use the word "hello" during telephone conversations.

### The Real Origin of "Hello"
The word "hello" did not originate from Bell or the telephone. "[Hello](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/aldinger)" comes from the interjection "hola", which was used in English before telephones existed to get someone's attention or express surprise. In the 1800s, sailors aboard ships would yell "ahoy" to announce their presence. It's believed "hello" became a mishearing of "ahoy" over the first telephone networks. 
### Edison Popularized the Greeting
In 1877, famous inventor Thomas Edison exchanged letters with a telephone company president where he suggested that "Hello!" could be heard from 10 to 20 feet away. This helped popularize the greeting of saying "hello" on the telephone. While it may have been in casual use before, Edison's recommendation helped establish it as the standard salutation for answering calls.
### Bell Married Mabel Hubbard, Not "Hello" 
False rumors have circulated online claiming Bell's first wife was named "Hello" or "Margaret Hello". In reality, the woman he developed a relationship with and later married was Mabel Gardiner Hubbard. **Bell was a teacher of the deaf and met Mabel while she was his student in 1871. They married in 1877 after the invention of the telephone.** Mabel went by her married name Mabel Bell and had no connection to the word "hello".
### So Who Coined the Term "Telephone"?
While Bell famously patented the telephone, he did not coin its name. The term "telephone" comes from the Greek roots "tele" meaning distant and "phone" meaning sound. It was first used in print by Philo Farnsworth in a 1871 scientific journal to describe his proposed invention. **Bell preferred the name "electrophonic" but "telephone" stuck due to its descriptive meaning and roots in the Greek language.**
## How Bell Developed the First Telephone Prototype 
With the backing of financiers including Thomas Sanders, Alexander Graham Bell dedicated himself to experimenting with ways to transmit speech electrically. He had already done extensive work with transmitting sound via wires as a professor at Boston University. 
In 1875, Bell began serious experiments with harmonic telegraphy, a way to multiplex several telegraph signals on a single wire. **He noticed that a steady current interrupted by a reed vibrated by the voice could reproduce speech on the receiving telegraph.** This led to a breakthrough idea - transmitting speech via undulations of a continuous electric current.
### Patenting the Telephone
On February 14, 1876, Bell succeeded in transmitting clear speech over wires with his experimental apparatus. He shouted "Mr. Watson, come here, I want to see you!" into the mouthpiece, which was heard by his assistant in an adjoining room. **Bell rushed to patent his breakthrough, filing a caveat on February 14th and receiving US Patent 174,465 on March 7, 1876 for "improvement in telegraphy".** It covered the idea of transmitting speech by electricity.
### Demonstrating the Telephone 
Word of Bell's invention quickly spread. To prove it worked over long distances, a makeshift line was strung between Boston and Cambridge. **On June 3rd, 1876, Bell's assistant Watson heard a broadcast performance staged in person by Bell 200 miles away. 
This demonstration was key to gaining financial support. Investor Thomas Sanders helped Bell form the Bell Telephone Company on July 9th, which soon established commercial telephone service between Boston and Salem, Massachusetts.** More exchanges were rolled out rapidly across the northeast as its functionality was realized. 
## Early Improvements and Expansion of Telephone Networks
With the first successful demonstrations completed, work began to improve telephone technology and infrastructure. Key areas of focus included enhancing clarity, expanding exchange capacities, and stretching transmission ranges. 
### Advancing Microphone and Receiver Design
The initial telephone prototype relied on a liquid transmitter and magnetic receiver. **Engineers like Thomas Edison sought improved microphones using compressed pieces of carbon instead of liquid.** Advances were also made in electromagnetic receiver designs to amplify faint signals. By the late 1870s, carbon microphones and electromagnetic receivers became the industry standard.
### Creating Telephone Exchanges 
Initially, each telephone required its own length of wire directly connecting to every other phone. **This was impractical for more than a handful of users. The solution was telephone exchanges - central offices where all lines terminated.** Calls were connected manually through operators aided by cord boards with jacks. By 1880, over 50 exchanges existed across America increasing connectedness exponentially. 
### Underground Cabling
Wireless transmission had limited capabilities in the late 19th century. **Extending service areas required running telephone lines substantial distances. Laying underground cables or along utility poles enabled wider coverage.** Long distance calls first connected New York and Boston in 1882 over hundreds of miles of copper wiring through exchanges. 
### International Calling
New network capabilities led to crossing borders. England and France built a radio-connected underwater transatlantic cable system in 1892 allowing calls between London and Paris. **Germany and Denmark followed with a radio-connected cable in 1895, and the United States soon joined via cables laid through bodies of water including Long Island Sound, Lake Erie and the Mississippi River.** This began the reality of international communications.
## Conclusion
Through visionaries like Bell, Edison and countless contributors, the telephone evolved rapidly from an experimental concept into an indispensable part of everyday life all over the world. **Starting from Bell's inspiration of transmitting speech electromagnetically, its practical functionality and economic accessibility were realized through continued refinement of infrastructure, technology and business models.** While its name and first famous call are rooted in myths, the telephone has truly connected humanity like no other invention before or since. Its legacy of global communications remains impactful today.
