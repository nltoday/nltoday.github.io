### Lost Identity
Harry has always struggled with being the "spare" heir and not the future King of England. He was constantly bullied for not being as intelligent or poised as his brother William. The death of his mother Diana at a young age also had a deep traumatic impact on him. All of this chipped away at his self-confidence and sense of identity over the years. When he met Meghan, he felt seen and valued by her for the first time. Smitten by her affection, Harry lost his own identity and individuality as he gave up everything from his friends to hobbies like hunting to fully commit to the relationship.

### An Unhealthy Attachment
Meghan came from a broken home with an absent mother and a father who doted on her excessively. As a result, she developed an unhealthy attachment style and Sense of self-worth that comes from the approval of others rather than an internal strength. Her constant need for external validation made her unable to handle even constructive criticism. She would lash out against anyone, even her own family, who did not give her undivided affection and praise. Her relationship with Harry became similarly codependent and toxic over time.
### Unrealistic Expectations
Initially thrilled with her royal status and popularity after marrying Harry, Meghan soon became disgruntled with the restrictions and scrutiny of royal life. However, instead of putting in the work like previous royal wives such as Camilla and Kate, she wanted the prestige and glamour without any of the responsibilities. She had unrealistic dreams of becoming a global celebrity and using the royal platform for her own ambitions. But royal duties cannot be cherry-picked, and the monarchy is an institution bigger than any individual.
### Patterns of Dysfunction 
Both Harry and Meghan had roots in deeply troubled families and unresolved childhood traumas that severely damaged their ability to have healthy relationships. Their codependency masked deep underlying issues that were never addressed. Despite all the opportunities, privileges and support provided by the royal family, they were never satisfied and constantly looked for external factors to blame for their unhappiness. This dysfunctional pattern was doomed from the start, as two unstable personalities enabled each other's worst tendencies rather than finding healing.
### Loss of Direction
After stepping back from royal duties and relocating to the US, Harry and Meghan lost a clear sense of purpose and direction. While speaking about compassion, they showed little kindness towards Harry's family during their bombshell interview. Meghan's dreams of spotlight and global influence also seem to be fizzling out as the novelty of their celebrity wears off in America. Without royal structures and communities to support them, it remains to be seen if they can forge stable careers or if past traumas will re-emerge in their isolated lifestyle away from home.
### Hope for Reconciliation 
For the sake of their own mental well-being and Archie's future, it is imperative that Harry and Meghan do some deep personal healing work to address their respective issues and dysfunctional patterns. They also need to find purposeful work to dedicate themselves to, instead of constantly stirring up drama for attention. With time and therapy, perhaps damaged relationships within both families can be cautiously rebuilt as wounds heal. But meaningful change starts from within through self-reflection and accountability, not more blaming of external factors for self-inflicted struggles. Only then can there be hope for lasting reconciliation and peace.
