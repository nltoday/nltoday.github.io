### # What are Official Street Addresses?
Official street addresses are assigned by local governments like counties, cities, or townships. These agencies determine and maintain address databases for their jurisdictions. The United States Postal Service (USPS) delivers mail based on these official addresses, but does not assign them.

### # Why do Addresses have Odd and Even Numbers?
In typical suburban neighborhoods with quarter-acre lots, street addresses follow a pattern where even numbers are on one side of the road and odd numbers are on the other. For example, 9202 may be across the street from 9203. This system helps postal carriers and delivery drivers easily locate addresses.
### # What do Fractional Addresses Represent?  
If another home is added to an existing lot, like a secondary dwelling or **"granny flat"**, it often receives a fractional address like **"1001 1‚ÅÑ2 East Street"**. This indicates it is a sub-property located semi-detached from the main residence. While these addresses may not appear on [mapping software](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-dad-daddy-owner-of-a-chihuahua-chihuahua-lover3736-t-shirt), the USPS recognizes them to deliver mail to the correct location.
### # How do Rural Address Systems Differ?
In more rural areas with larger plots of land, neighborhood addresses may be farther apart. For example, one property could be 11032 while the next is 11052 many yards away. This non-sequential system works for low-density countryside.
### # Why might Addresses be Entered Incorrectly?  
Clerical errors can occur when address data is inputted manually. A housing development may be planned with a logical numbering scheme, but actual built addresses become disorganized over time as new properties are added. In small towns, a secondary **"1/2"** designation helped carriers differentiate mail for a main home vs an attached or nearby rental unit.
### # How can I find my Fractional or Odd Address?
While fractional or rural addresses may lack mappings online, the USPS aims to deliver to them based on official records. Contact your local planning department to verify address details, as utility companies manage street naming and numbering. Persistently incorrect addresses sometimes just need updating in **address databases** as an area develops.
### # Resolving Addressing Confusion 
Mistakes happening during data entry is a common culprit for addressing errors. In sparsely populated rural areas, numbers may be assigned at large intervals unrelated to lot placement. Over decades, originally organized schemes degrade without centralized management. Property owners in doubt should inquire with their **county/city GIS department** or contact local postmasters to report discrepancies needing fixes **to routing software.** Together, governments and carriers strive to resolve confusion for efficient mail and service delivery.
### # The Evolving Nature of Address Systems
As communities change, address systems must adapt. Subdivisions expand, new construction alters street grids, and populations densify formerly rural zones. Fractional designations and irregular numbering once served low-density areas now experiencing growth. Address authorities work to rationalize legacy schemas complicating modern navigation. With coordination between land managers and delivery agents, issues then lesser-used address types can receive updates keeping residence locations findable.**
