Growing up, art has always been my passion. However, sharing my artwork with others was something I was always shy about. That was until I discovered the power of Instagram to connect with other artists and get meaningful feedback. In this post, I want to share my personal journey of growing my art skills and Instagram presence over the last few months.
### Testing Out New Art Supplies
A few weeks ago, I came across a cheap deal for a set of brush pens. As an artist always looking to improve my skills and [experiment with new art mediums](https://yt.io.vn/collection/agostino), I couldn't resist picking them up. When the pens arrived, I was so excited to get started that I dove right into my sketchbook to test them out. While playing around with different brush strokes and color blending techniques, I found the pens provided smooth layers and vibrant hues. By the end of the session, I was pleased with the results and felt my skills were advancing.

### Sharing My Work For the First Time  
Thrilled by how the brush pen sketches turned out, I decided to take the next step and share my work on Instagram for the first time. I carefully selected my favorite pieces and uploaded high-quality photos showing off the details. However, when I checked back the next day, I was disappointed to see that none of my posts were receiving many likes or comments. It seemed my early artwork wasn't appealing to my small audience yet. This experience taught me the importance of constantly improving my skills to engage followers.
### Reflecting on the Feedback
While the lack of response to my initial Instagram posts was disheartening, I took it as constructive criticism to improve further. Over the next few weeks, I focused on practicing fundamentals like proportions, values, and composition through daily sketches. I also started following more professional artists on Instagram to study their styles and techniques. One day, out of curiosity, I checked back on those original brush pen posts. Surprisingly, the likes and comments had slowly grown over time as my skills progressed. This showed me that with patience and dedication to my craft, quality artwork will eventually find its audience.
### Gaining Confidence in My Growing Abilities  
A month later, I felt my skills with brush pens and other mediums had significantly improved through regular practice. Eager to capture these advancing abilities, I started snapping photos of my daily sketches and paintings to thoroughly **document my art journey**. Around this time, I also gained more followers interested in watching my growth. Pleased with a recent pen and ink landscape study, I shared it on Instagram. Over the next day, I was thrilled to see engagement rapidly growing with many positive comments. It seemed my dedicated practice was starting to pay off and followers were appreciating the developments in my style. This burst of support encouraged me to keep sharing my artwork and creative process.
### Connecting with Fellow Artists Online
As my Instagram presence grew, I began interacting more within the online art community. I found following professional concept artists and leaving thoughtful comments on their posts often sparked engaging discussions. Some of these artists would occasionally repost my work on their stories, exposing my art to even wider audiences. I also joined relevant hashtag communities like #Illustration and #BrushLettering, allowing me find inspiration from others and get discovered. Through these virtual connections, I met several creative peers with whom I now frequently exchange tips, critiques and motivation. Ultimately, building rapport with others on Instagram expanded my skills exponentially through collaborative learning.
### Finding Meaningful Feedback and Support  
One night while casually browsing Instagram, I came across a question asking users to share the weirdest photo on their phone. Intrigued, I decided to scroll through my camera roll and found an amusing image I had absentmindedly captured in my bedroom some time ago. On a whim, I decided to upload the peculiar picture in response. Within a few hours, the post surprisingly gained thousands of likes and comments from users amused by its unexpected nature. Though a silly snapshot, the unexpected success reinforced how sharing authentic content can create meaningful interactions. Since then, I made sure to frequently upload snapshots documenting my creative process alongside refined pieces to foster more personal engagement. The feedback and support from my growing community have become incredibly soul-fulfilling and motivating to keep improving my craft.
### Maintaining Momentum Going Forward
Looking back, I am proud of how far my skills and online presence have come in just a few short months. Staying dedicated to regular practice, sharing authentic process shots, and engaging within virtual communities have all contributed immensely to my growth. Moving forward, I plan to keep challenging myself with new mediums and experimental styles. I will also continue thoroughly documenting my artistic journey on Instagram to inspire others. My ultimate goal is to one day make a living from creating art, and I believe this online platform will be instrumental in helping manifest that dream. As long as I stay focused on honing my abilities and nurturing connections, I am confident this creative path will lead to many fulfilling opportunities ahead.
