Windows updates provide critical security fixes and improvements to keep your device protected and running smoothly. However, issues can sometimes arise that prevent installing these important updates. This guide covers common Windows update errors like 0x80070422 and their fixes so you can get your device fully patched again.
### Restart and Try Again
The first thing to do when encountering any error is to restart your device and try the update again. Many issues are temporary in nature and a restart is often all that's needed to resolve them. [Transient error conditions](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-but-psycho-bae-darling-crazy-girlfriend-t-shirt/men&) and **service restarts** can cause spurious errors that go away after a reboot. Don't waste time troubleshooting further if a simple restart fixes the problem.

### Check Update Services
Error 0x80070422 commonly occurs when the Windows Update service stops responding. Validate it's running by opening the Services dialog and ensuring the Windows Update service is set to Automatic startup. Under the service status, click Start to ensure it begins running again. The service controls all update operations, so issues here will prevent updates from installing properly. Make sure to restart afterwards and try installing updates once more.
### Run Windows Troubleshooter 
The Windows troubleshooter is designed to diagnose and automatically fix common problems like update errors. It may detect and repair issues like corrupted or missing update files that are preventing a successful installation. Open Settings, click Update & Security, select Troubleshoot on the left, then Additional troubleshooters and run the Windows Update troubleshooter. Let it fully complete before checking for updates again. Troubleshooters offer a quick first step to resolving many software issues.
### Temporarily Disable Security Software
Some antivirus or firewall programs can interfere with Windows updating if overly aggressive in blocking network traffic. Try **temporarily disabling** your security programs, downloading any available updates, then re-enabling security once complete. Defender is the main one to pause as it's built into Windows already. Give Microsoft's products a chance to operate without interference from third-party security vendors.
### Use System File Checker 
This free Windows tool can scan for and repair issues with system files like corrupted or missing Windows update files. Open an elevated command prompt and run the sfc /scannow command to initiate a check. Some users also benefit from additional DISM scans and repairs as part of the process. Any file integrity problems blocking updates may get resolved through this utility. 
### Scan for Malware Infections
Rarely, malware could infect a system and interfere with the normal update flow. Run a full antivirus scan to detect any sophisticated infections disrupting update operations. Malware has been known to replace update files or alter settings to block auto-updating. Eliminate this possibility with a thorough examination of your device for any unwanted programs or changes to settings.
### Try Windows Update Assistant or Media Creation Tool  
For stubborn errors still persisting, Microsoft provides additional troubleshooting tools. The Windows Update Assistant is designed for difficult update problems and may fix issues where other methods failed. As a last resort, use the Media Creation Tool to perform an in-place upgrade or reset of your Windows installation to completely refresh it and restart the update process from scratch.
### Contact Microsoft Support
If all else fails and you continue to receive strange errors preventing important updates, it may be time for direct assistance. Microsoft support professionals have deep troubleshooting experience with the Windows Update system. They can examine logs and configuration details to determine any underlying problems blocking updates that self-help methods could not resolve. Pursue live support as a final step for persistent errors.
Hopefully this guide has provided solutions to common update errors on your Windows device and gotten things fully patched again. Regularly installing updates is important for security and usability, so keep your device protected and running optimally.
