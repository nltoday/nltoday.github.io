### What causes these update errors?
Windows update errors can occur for a variety of reasons. Error code 0x8007005 tends to happen when the user does not have the proper permissions to complete an update. [Malware infections](https://store.fi.io.vn/funny-video-gamer-xmas-i-paused-my-game-to-be-here-christmas-24/women&) or not being logged in as an administrator are common causes. Error 0x800705b4 also occurs due to similar issues such as outdated **drivers** or third-party software conflicts interfering with Windows updates. It is important to troubleshoot the root cause so these errors can be resolved.

### Check for incompatible applications  
One potential reason for error 0x8007005 is an **application incompatibility**. This error interrupts the update process if a program on the system is not compatible with the changes made by Windows updates. To identify the culprit, first download and install SQL Server 2016 Express and the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK). The ADK allows scanning the system for incompatible applications. Refer to the Microsoft website for step-by-step instructions on using the ADK for this purpose. Identifying and uninstalling or updating the incompatible program can fix update blockers.
### Troubleshoot as administrator 
Many update errors stem from lack of proper permissions. Make sure to log into the system as an administrator account when troubleshooting. This solves issues where standard user rights are insufficient. For 0x8007005 specifically, logging in with full administrative privileges allows bypassing file/registry permission problems that commonly cause this error. Elevating access allows the necessary changes to complete Windows updates smoothly.  
### Scan and clean for malware
Malicious software like **viruses** and **trojans** can wreak havoc on the system and disrupt updates. They may alter important files or registry settings Windows needs. Run a full malware scan with a reputable antivirus to detect and remove any infections. This clears the path for updates to apply cleanly without interference. Windows Defender, Malwarebytes, and other free scanners effectively scan and clear malware.
### Update drivers manually
Outdated device **drivers** commonly trigger 0x800705b4 errors by conflicting with update requirements. Manually update all drivers, particularly those for graphics cards, chipsets, network adapters and more. Visit the manufacturer's support site or use Windows Update to obtain the latest versions compatible with your installed Windows build. Up-to-date drivers let the system interface properly with updates to avoid errors.
### Temporary disable security software
Some third-party security programs overstep their boundaries and block Windows updates improperly. Temporarily disable additional antivirus, firewalls or other security suites to test if they cause 0x800705b4. If the error clears with them off, re-evaluate usage or update those programs to play nicer with Windows updates. The built-in Windows Defender remains active as a baseline security measure during testing.  
### Check Windows services
Certain system services need to run for updates to work properly. 0x800705b4 can result if Windows Defender or other required services are not starting up as intended. In the Services console, verify services like Windows Defender, BITS, and Windows Update are started. Try restarting or changing startup type to "Automatic" if any are disabled. A system reboot may then allow kicking off previously blocked updates.
### Run Windows Update troubleshooter
The troubleshooter scans for common update blockers and fixes issues automatically if possible. Search for "Troubleshoot settings" in Windows, select "Additional troubleshooters" and click "Windows Update". This identifies and resolves a number of update errors without manual debugging. As a last resort, downloading the standalone Fix Windows Update Errors tool from Microsoft installs the troubleshooter for standalone use on stubborn update problems.
### Reinstall latest Windows build 
In truly persistent cases that defeat all troubleshooting, a reinstall of the current Windows version becomes necessary. This ensures a clean starting point free of any software, driver or firmware issues preventing updates. Back up personal files first, then either perform an in-place upgrade through Settings or completely wipe and reinstall. After setup, Windows patches itself up-to-date in the process while avoiding past blockers. This nuclear option is rarely needed but very effective when other methods fail.
### Know when to seek support
Troubleshooting Windows update errors takes patience but the above techniques solve the majority of cases. If none work or an update continually reintroduces the same error, Microsoft support forums provide additional help. An support agent may need remote access to fully diagnose the root cause on rare hard-to-fix problems. But exhausting basic options should resolve standard update errors like 0x8007005 and 0x800705b4 without assistance in many situations. Armed with the right tools, these issues need not stall using Windows features.
# Conclusion 
Windows update errors can frustrate users but do not typically signal serious system problems on their own. By fully troubleshooting the root causes like outdated software, driver conflicts, or malware infections, resolutions are nearly always possible. Taking a methodical approach through testing security programs, driver updates, scanning as administrator, and using troubleshooters fixes most cases of 0x8007005 and 0x800705b4 errors. While reinstallation remains an option of last resort, these techniques restore smooth Windows updates without the need for costlier repair methods in the vast majority of situations. Resolving update errors ensures maximizing Windows performance and stability over the long run.
