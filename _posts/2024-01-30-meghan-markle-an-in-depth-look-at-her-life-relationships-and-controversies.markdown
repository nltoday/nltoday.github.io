### Family Troubles
Meghan Markle's family history provides insights into her character. Her father, Thomas Markle, played a major supportive role early in her life. He got her a role on the TV show *Suits* and paid for her education, though Meghan later dismissed these claims. Their relationship soured after her marriage to Prince Harry. She didn't invite Thomas to the wedding despite him walking her down the aisle being her childhood dream. Meghan penned a letter to Thomas anticipating he would leak it, further damaging their relationship. While families often have problems, Meghan's treatment of her father and lack of contact with other relatives like her half-sister Samantha raised eyebrows.

### A Shallow Hollywood Career
Prior to meeting Prince Harry, Meghan had a [shallower Hollywood career](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cow-mom-cute-womens-70s-80s-retro-style-sunset-moo-moo-lover-v-neck-t-shirt/women&) as a moderately successful actress. She struggled to find major roles, appearing in movies and shows you've likely never heard of. Her biggest part was a recurring role on the USA network drama *Suits*, but she was dropped after season 7 when she began dating Harry. Meghan seemingly cared more about fame and status than creative fulfillment. Many saw Prince Harry as her ticket to the spotlight she desperately craved but couldn't attain through talent alone.
### Questionable Past Relationships 
Meghan's dating history raises issues. She was married once before to producer Trevor Engelson, a marriage that lasted just two years. After the divorce, she dated celebrity chef Cory Vitiello for almost two years but abruptly ended it when she began seeing Harry. Both men were replaced quickly once higher-status partners came along. Additionally, she lived with another boyfriend for seven years but they never married, fueling criticisms of her being a "**serial dater**" more interested in the perks of relationships than long-term commitment. 
### In over Her Head
When Meghan joined the royal family, it was clear she was unprepared for the transition. She struggled with the bounds of **royal protocol and expectations**. From sensitive political issues to scrutiny of her lavish lifestyle, controversies grew during their brief time as senior working royals. Ultimately, Harry and Meghan's retreat to California showed that life as royals was not what they truly wanted. Neither seemed willing to embrace the duties required while enjoying the lifestyle benefits. Their abrupt exit damaged Harry's relationship with his family and country.
### Questionable Post-Royal Behavior
In the years since, more red flags have emerged about Meghan's character. The tell-all interviews with Oprah and other outlets contained dubious claims, like suggestions of royal racism with no evidence. Meanwhile, her behavior has become increasingly attention-seeking and opportunistic. New documentaries and books she hasn't participated in are branded "one-sided" if critical, showing lack of willingness for real scrutiny. Additionally, rumors of tensions with other royals like Kate Middleton persist despite public denials. Overall, much of Meghan's post-royal conduct reinforces perceptions of her as self-absorbed and **manipulative of the media for fame and financial gain.**
### Conclusion: A Cautionary Tale 
Upon deeper examination, Meghan Markle's history reflects someone obsessed with celebrity, status and wealth over genuine accomplishments or strong relationships. While any individual merits fair treatment, Meghan's actions - from abandoning family to exploiting the royals - suggest a narcissistic personality more interested in what others can offer her personally than mutual care or responsibility. For an inspirational biracial figure touted early on, she's become a cautionary tale of allowing superficial goals to override character. Moving forward, wiser discussions of her legacy should consider both merits and demerits objectively rather than defending or attacking based on preconceptions. An balanced accounting offers the most helpful insights for society.
