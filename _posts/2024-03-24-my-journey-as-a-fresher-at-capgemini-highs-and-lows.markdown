### Onboarding Experience
My journey began with the onboarding process at Capgemini's Bengaluru office. As a new joinee fresh out of college, relocating to a new city was exciting yet nerve-wracking. The HR team could have provided better guidance and support during this transition period. 
The initial orientation lacked positivity and came across more as intimidation. Freshers were threatened with strict penalties for any minor policy violations, instead of a warm welcome. This set the wrong tone for the beginning of our careers.

### Painful Training Phase  
The mandatory three-month training was the next major hurdle. I was placed at the [CIS Academy](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-custom-proud-football-grandma-number-60-personalized-women-v-neck-t-shirt/men&) (Capgemini's training center) located in Whitefield, Bengaluru. This is where I first encountered **_Sita Manukumar_**, the head of fresher training.
Sita openly expressed her dislike and prejudice against people from North India. As a North Indian myself, her blatant racism made the training environment very uncomfortable. Her rude behavior continued in interactions, where she even insulted the entire class on one occasion.
Under Sita, **_Nibedita Gon_** was the Soft Skills trainer. However, Nibedita's own poor communication skills and inappropriate conduct were unbefitting her role. She found pleasure in publicly criticizing and body-shaming trainees. Nibedita too held racist views against people from North India.
Both Sita and Nibedita, along with others on their team, inflicted immense misery on freshers through their toxic management. Ridiculous rules like 400 Rupees fines for even second delays added unnecessary stress. Overall, the three months of training were a harrowing experience due to such individuals.  
### Diverse Project Allocations
After surviving the training ordeal, project allocations varied greatly based on individual performance and favoritism. For those fortunate, technology-focused projects presented opportunities to learn and grow. 
However, some **IT graduates were placed in pure BPO roles** like call center support, which did not align with their skills and expectations. While important, such functions should not have been the primary jobs for technical degree holders.  
### Joys and Frustrations of On-floor Work
Thankfully, certain colleagues and mentors became pillars of support on-floor, balancing some of the negativity. Working on live projects and clients was stimulating. However, unreasonable management practices took a toll.
Constant pestering to rush tasks without respecting estimated timelines crushed morale. Last-minute changes jeopardized prior work without acknowledgment. Project scopes enlarged arbitrarily through additional commitments.
Decision-making excluded developers' inputs, with little visibility till the eleventh hour. Zero recognition of contributions reinforced the culture of taking employees for granted. Uncalled for rude behavior from superiors was also prevalent.
### Work-life Balance Woes  
Capgemini expected unreasonable flexibility, without proper compensation for overtime. Members were pressured to accept commitments without feasibility checks. 
This necessitated long, stressful hours to meet unrealistic deadlines. However, this extra effort went unrecognized during appraisals. Well-deserved credit rarely materialized, impacting both motivation and career growth.
### Silver Linings and Lessons Learned
While the majority of my Capgemini experience left me disheartened, notable positives emerged too. Supportive coworkers helped weather many crises jointly. The exposure to diverse clients and technologies expanded my skills meaningfully.
Most importantly, this journey highlighted the importance of workplace culture and respectful management. Organizations must offer conducive environments for professionals to thrive sustainably. Both rights and responsibilities of employees and employers need a balanced approach.
Overall, my time at Capgemini was a mixed bag of highs and lows. The high-potential company would surely benefit from improvements to fresher induction processes and personnel management strategies. With adjustments to address current gaps, it could become a truly positive organization for all.
