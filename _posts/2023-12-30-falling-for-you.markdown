I chuckled loudly, trying to hide my embarrassment as my friend teased about my lack of romance. Inside, I felt anything but joking. The truth was I had been harbouring feelings for someone - someone I couldn't have.

Every time I saw **her**, I wanted to spill all the poetry and sweet nothings I kept bottled up. But I dared not let **her** see how deeply I cared - it would leave me too vulnerable. If **she** knew how I felt, **she** would have power over me that I wasn't ready to give. So I stuffed down my emotions and pretended not to feel the torrent inside.
### My well kept secret
Little did my friend know, the romance was there - it just couldn't be for **him**. While others spoke lightly of casual flings, for me there was only one - the dreamy daydreams I nurtured alone. If only walls could talk, **they** would know the secret whispers I uttered in solitude. But no one could hear the private proclamations of my true heart.

### Words left unsaid
All the beautiful language I longed to speak remained trapped within. My soul cried out to shower **her** with affection, yet dared not let the three words slip free for fear of rejection. So I kept my deepest devotion chained, not daring to hope it could ever be requited. If only **she** knew how **her** simple smile or touch set my spirit soaring. But **she** remained oblivious to the secrets I harboured so zealously guarded.
### Ignorant bliss
While for me each moment held a private pining, to **her** we interacted as normal friends. **She** went about **her** day unburdened by hidden ardour, unaware the simple glances we shared held deeper meaning for me alone. Perhaps it was better this way - at least for now **she** felt no pressure or obligation. **Her** blithe ignorance spared **us** potential awkwardness. So I endured my clandestine adoration silently.
### A chance at confession
One night, after everyone else had left, I found the courage to finally speak my heart. Looking into **her** beautiful eyes, I laid bare my soul, confessing every flowery phrase and poetic musing I had jealously kept to myself. At last all the sonnets and declarations spilled freely from my lips, no longer dammed behind lips. **Her** reaction could determine my happiness or break my heart - but either way, **she** would finally understand. In that pivotal moment, my destined love was laid before **her**. Now **her** reply would be my answer. 
**blossoming love bared soul kindred spirits**
### A reciprocated love  
**Her** reply was all I dreamed - smiling through welling tears, **she** took my hands and reciprocated every sentiment. **Her** heart, too, had long harboured a secret affinity but doubted it could be returned. In an instant all doubt melted away as **we** realized our fates had been intertwined all along. At last **we** could love openly without barriers, nourish our kindred souls through honesty and trust. From that moment a blooming romance began more beautiful than any tale could capture. **Her** acceptance was the greatest gift **she** could ever offer me.
### Our soulbound future
Now no force on earth could come between the love **we** shared. Having overcome the barriers of secrecy, an eternity stretched brightly before us. No more longing stares from afar - henceforth **we** would walk together, nourishing our connection through compassion and understanding. Whatever life brought, **we** would face united as one. And in quieter moments **we** looked to the future, envisioning little visions of the life and family **we** would build together as soulmates through all seasons. At last the future was ours to shape as **we** pleased, bound eternally by the love that could deny.
