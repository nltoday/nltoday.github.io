### Starting the Preparation
It was after my 10th board exams that I came across the idea of preparing for JEE from an aunt. My mother started inquiring all around to understand more about this exam called IIT JEE. That's when she enrolled me into a coaching class in April 2010 without me having any clue about what IIT is. However, during the initial few months of preparation, I began to understand the [importance and significance of IITs](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-holiday-funny-santa-shetland-sheepdog-christmas-tree-2).

### Early Struggles and Demotivation 
I soon realized that all my batchmates in coaching were top rankers with achievements like gold medals in national level exams. Scoring poorly in initial tests like 102/480 while the topper scored 394 was really **demotivating for an average student like me**. I broke down telling my mother that I won't be able to crack it. But she motivated me to continue with consistency and hard work.
### Turning Point and Increased Efforts
It was when I approached my math sir for help that things started changing. **I increased my study hours five-fold** from initial 1-2 hours to dedicate majority of my day solely for JEE preparation. Though results didn't come immediately, my marks gradually improved to around 250/480 consistently with peers appreciating the dedication. 
### Determination and Eye on Improvement
Rather than competing, I started focussing on self-improvement. Coming closer to exam days, I scaled new heights touching 355/480, shocking even my teachers. None from my branch could clear JEE that year barring me showcasing the power of perseverance.
### Hard Work Pays Off Eventually
After two years of relentless focus and **tireless efforts to overcome my average abilities**, I was able to crack one of the toughest exams in India. My journey proves that diligence and willpower can make even an average student's JEE dreams come true.
### Staying Focussed is Key
There will be ups and downs, but **keeping your eyes on the goal** can help you achieve what many may perceive impossible. If I with average skills could do it, so can anyone with dedication to give their hundred percent everyday.
### Inspiring Others with My Story
I hope sharing my story provides the necessary motivation for aspirants who may be struggling initially or feeling it's beyond their capabilities. Endless hard work and self-belief can make the extraordinary happen. Never lose hope, keep learning from mistakes and march forward consistently.
