## Issues with Chegg's New Platform
Chegg recently launched a new online learning platform called Chegg 2.0. However, the platform has been riddled with bugs and technical glitches from the beginning. As a subject matter expert, I have faced many frustrations while using this platform to answer student questions. 
Some of the most common errors I encounter are "Answer Size is longer than expected" messages when trying to submit responses. This wastes a significant amount of time rewriting answers to fit artificial length restrictions. The platform also frequently crashes or logs experts out for no reason, losing entire answers. 
Despite these ongoing issues, Chegg seems unwilling or unable to properly fix the problems. The glitchy platform makes the work inefficient and stressful. As subject matter experts, we need reliable tools to effectively help students. Chegg 2.0 has proven itself anything but reliable.
### Low Payment Amount Does Not Match High Workload 
Not only is the new Chegg platform problematic, but the compensation does not justify the effort required. Answering student questions often involves **research-intensive long-form responses**. Yet Chegg only pays around $1.88 USD per question. 
For the amount of time spent researching, writing thorough multi-paragraph answers, and dealing with technical problems, this payment is unattractively low. It does not make financial sense for someone relying on this work as their main income or living in a high cost of living area.

## Unfair Account Review and Revocation Policies 
Chegg's policies for reviewing subject matter expert accounts are vague and arbitrary. One's Chegg Faculty (CF) score, which determines job security, depends heavily on unpredictable student ratings. 
Students can downvote answers for any reason, including simply not liking a correct response. This negatively impacts experts despite providing factually accurate information. Maintaining a high CF is an impossible challenge due to this flawed rating system outside of one's control.
### question"Automatic Revocation Without Transparency 
Perhaps most concerning is how Chegg can revoke accounts and terminate employment without notice or clear justification. The automated systems seem to do this removal of subject matter experts, providing no opportunity to appeal bogus downvotes or ratings. 
This complete lack of transparency or ability to contact decision-makers leaves experts in a constant state of job insecurity. One risks losing their source of income through no demonstrable fault of their own. Such arbitrary treatment of contractors serves no benefit other than distancing responsibility from the corporation.
## Inadequate Quality Control of Student Submissions  
While subject matter experts face strict honor codes and accountability, the same cannot be said for students using Chegg's services. They can post direct exam questions and assignments from courses without consequence. 
This incentivizes academic dishonesty by outsourcing homework against instructor wishes. Meanwhile, experts must spend precious time ensuring they do not accidentally help with any copyrighted materials or assignments not meant for third-party assistance. 
### "question quality" and "student submissions"
A further issue is the lack of screening submitted questions for appropriateness, completeness, or clarity. Vague, unclear, or nonsensical questions still appear in subject matter expert queues. Answering such ambiguous "questions" becomes an inefficient guessing game or waste of time. 
Chegg would do well to impose basic standards on student question quality before distributing them to hard-working subject specialists. This could help improve workflow and deliver better learning experiences for all involved.
## Unqualified Students Downvote Correct Answers
Subject matter experts taking the time to provide multi-step, rigorously researched solutions to complicated questions often receive downvotes despite giving factually right responses. This occurs because students neither have the expertise nor incentive to properly evaluate answers. 
Many simply vote without comprehending nuanced explanations or downvote when frustrated by a difficult question. This further undermines the CF review system and professionals' ability to fairly maintain their status on the platform. Chegg fails to recognize the imbalance between student and expert accountability.
## Conclusion
In summary, while Chegg aims to foster learning, its current practices regarding subject matter experts seem exploitative and unfair. The corporationprioritizes profits over supporting and respecting the contractors powering its service. 
Numerous problems degrade the user and worker experience, from technical issues to arbitrary policies. For true commitment to high-quality education, Chegg must re-evaluate how it treats and invests in the highly-skilled specialists enabling its operations. With improvements to compensation, working conditions, and quality control, the platform could realize its potential to benefit all members of the learning community.
