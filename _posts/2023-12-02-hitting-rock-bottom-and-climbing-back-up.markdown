### A Soccer Player's Identity Crisis
I played soccer my entire life since I was 9 years old. It became my entire identity through high school and college where I was recruited to play Division 1 soccer. My plan was to play professionally in the MLS after college but injuries hindered my career. I graduated without fulfilling my soccer dreams and lost my identity in the process. Taking an improv comedy class helped me find a new passion but those first few years without soccer left me feeling empty and lost.

### Starting a New Career With No Direction 
After graduating, I started working as an accountant but had no passion for it. I would come home and do nothing with all my free time, dreading the emptiness. [unexpected career change](https://store.fi.io.vn/white-poodle-coffee-latte-winter-christmas-dog-mom-holiday-1) and loss of purpose had me in a dark place. Having soccer be number one for so long, its sudden removal from my life felt devastating. I struggled to find a new purpose or identity without the sport.
### Finding Comedy Through Dark Times
On a whim, I took an improv comedy class hoping to make new friends in my new city. I had always enjoyed humor but never explored it. Making people laugh in class gave me a sense of joy soccer no longer could. I discovered a talent I never knew I had. I got into stand-up comedy, finding an artistic outlet that fits my personality and gives me control. Telling my story through comedy has been therapeutic.

### A Marriage Falling Apart
At 38, I believed my life was heading in the right direction after graduating college with my husband. But he landed a good job immediately while I could only find temporary work. He seemed to lose respect for me and moved to the spare bedroom. Constantly going to "volunteer", he'd drop me off without talking about our issues. With debts and a house needing repairs, money was tight. 
### Confronting Suspicions  
Finding travel-size shampoo bottles, I knew something was wrong since he never traveled for work. But he refused to admit anything, brushing off my concerns. Therapy helped me initially but he wouldn't go anymore. Arguments grew heated as he took the only car every night. Coming home at all hours, he ignored my requests to discuss our marriage fairly.
### Hitting Rock Bottom Alone
He never returned after one fight, disappearing without paying bills in our name. Collections agencies hounded me while friends avoided getting involved. Struggling with **temporary jobs** and living paycheck to paycheck, I pawned my wedding ring just to eat. The house nearly went into foreclosure before I sold possessions to pay debts. Nothing has come close to that all-encompassing  despair of being utterly alone through that darkness.
### Rebuilding After Devastating Loss  
It took years to climb out of financial ruin while avoiding suicidal thoughts in the hardest times. Somehow I managed to pay off the house on my own. Now debt-free with a place to call home, life has stabilized. But past traumas still linger, and I've not considered remarrying since. My hope is that others going through **life-changing hardships** can find their way to calmer waters as well through perseverance and small victories, however long it may take.
### A Father's Darkest Night  
With my wife suddenly taking our son and disappearing, money troubles spiraled out of control. Losing job and home, we lived off cases of bottled water as utilities were cut. On the brink of eviction with barely any food, all I wanted was for her to return. But one night, my young son made a wish upon a shooting star for his mother, reducing me to gut-wrenching sobs. In that moment as a single dad, hopelessness had never felt so complete. 
### Rebuilding Bonds After Devastation
Thankfully, we have recovered from that bleak time. With her out of the picture, he is doing well surrounded by friends while seldom mentioning her. After job struggles, I started my own business that allows stability. Most importantly, I have been talking to someone new who pursued me during my period of focusing inward instead of dating. Things are looking up again with new bonds to replace what was broken before. Our darkest moments often prepare us well for better days ahead through perseverance.
