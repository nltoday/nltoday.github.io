## Raising Generations 
Farming families have long raised children according to time-tested traditions passed down through the generations. Raising seven siblings himself, the writer recalls how babies were fed on the farm. Breastmilk was considered the perfect nourishment for newborns. Cow or goat's milk was occasionally used when breastfeeding was impossible, but only from the mother of that species. Switching to mashed table foods started around **5-6 months old**, with small amounts of milk added for easier digestion. Full integration into family meals occurred **by 1 year old**. These natural practices helped babies thrive.
## Doctors' Different Advice
While modern medicine now takes a divergent approach, the writer remains skeptical of doctors without children. Most physicians his children saw lacked **personal parenting experience**. instead relying on "advice read from a book." Trusting those who've "been there" makes sense for complex matters like **raising children**. The writer follows traditions learned from his mother and foremothers rather than doctors distant from the real world. Their lack of attachment leaves advice sterile rather than tailored to each unique baby. 
## Wisdom in Experience
Seeking experienced counsel also applies to dangerous domains. The writer consults only veteran chemists about chemical handling, ignoring generalized safety data sheets. **Raising children and using chemicals both require caution**, as mistakes can harm. But longevity signals those who've navigated hazards successfully. Their earned intuition recognizes nuances textbooks miss. Similarly, the writer accepts farming wisdom from elders still upright despite life's risks. Experience outweighs book-learning for delicate parenthood and perilous situations demandiing well-honed perception.
## A Buffalo's Sustenance
Sharing his story, one writer describes how buffalo's milk sustained him from 3 weeks old. His mother's breastmilk ceased by 21 days, and formula was unavailable. Nonetheless, he flourished on straight buffalo milk, avoiding allergies except dust and smoke. This real-world case counters notions of strict species-specificity. While breast remains best, alternative milks need not doom babies when necessity demands creative solutions. Traditional ways bode well until proven harmful. Openness to nuance softens rigid thinking and respects what supports healthy growth.
## Breastmilk's Bests  
Before debating cow's milk for a 2-month-old, one considers breastmilk advantages. As **"the perfect food"**, it strengthens immunity through antibodies transferred until age 6 months. This prevents common illnesses like ear infections, diarrhea, and respiratory problems. Breastmilk digests easily thanks to components tailored for babies. Nutritionally complete except for vitamin D, it spares babies discomfort while meeting needs. Affordably natural and convenient without bottling hassle, breastfeeding correlates with higher IQs later in life. Clearly nature designs this nourishment exclusively for precious newborns.
## Cow's milk Cons 
However, at only 2 months, a baby's immature gastrointestinal system renders cow's milk unsafe. Their developing pancreas and stomach face undue pressure processing its heaviness before solids enter the diet. Also nutritionally incomplete versus breastmilk, cow's milk may cause anemia in babies exposed prior to age 1 according to studies. Its introduction demands pediatric supervision given potential impacts on fragile development. While goat milk offers a breastmilk-alternative, the consensus remains that **no milk but mother's own suffices** during the crucial first 6 months of life. Nurturing new life calls for patience and priority of health over haste or substitution. Babies deserve nature's perfection tailored to their needs.
## A Pediatric Perspective
Providing expert opinion, Dr. Sharad introduces his pediatric experience helping parents through their journey. With 14 years in the field including Neonatology Fellowship, he offers solutions rather than just problems. Committed to empowering parents with knowledge, Dr. Sharad organizes informative live sessions and webinars. Access to such medical authority reassures those navigating milestones and concerns and supports making choices respecting a baby's wellbeing and needs over external pressures. Experienced guidance promotes confidence that science, wisdom and compassion unite to uphold each baby's right to thrive by nature's loving provisions.
## Concluding Thoughts 
Tradition and modern practice need not totally diverge regarding infant care. Both aim to nurture new life, though scientific rigidity sometimes overlooks practical solutions out of necessity. Openness to safe alternatives when breast truly cannot nourish shows care, not criticism of nature's plan. But scientific consensus on exclusively breastmilk's superiority for newborns' immature systems deserves respect. As does wisdom gained through generations of flourishing families following patterns attentive to individual needs. Finding harmony honors progress and ancestry, babies and mothers. With care, understanding and community, all may nurture tomorrow's future.
