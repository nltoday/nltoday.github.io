### Starting Fresh in Bangalore  
After graduating from engineering in 2007, I struggled to find a job despite scoring excellent marks. Faced with no campus placements, I moved to Bangalore with hopes of starting fresh. I enrolled in a Java training course, paying 10,000 rupees of my 50,000 rupee savings. [Persistent engineer seeking first software job](https://yt.io.vn/collection/abdul) in Bangalore.

### Financial Hardship and Difficult Job Search
By the end of two months of searching and training, I had only 30,000 rupees left. Extending my search further depleted my funds to 25,000 rupees without success. Focused on my passion for **VLSI design career path**, I discussed pursuing a related course with my parents.

My parents and I made the difficult decision to sell our family gold jewelry to raise the 55,000 rupees needed. I returned to Bangalore with renewed hope and 70,000 rupees in total. Enrolling in the course, I paid the initial 25,000 rupee installment and committed to frugal living to make ends meet.
### Extreme Frugality and Hard Work Pay Off
To save on expenses, I moved in with friends and walked long distances daily. On weekends, I studied all night to avoid food costs. After 5 months, I had secured an internship in a small VLSI company, earning a meager 3,000 rupees per month. Despite long hours and weekends, I gladly accepted the opportunity to gain experience in my field. Through perseverance and sacrifice, my dream was coming true.
### Close Calls and Continued Determination  
By the 20th of each month, my funds ran dangerously low until payday. Relying on snacks from work and drinking only tea, I persevered through difficult times. Continuing to give my all at the internship led to a pay increase within a year. My dedication and resilience allowed me to overcome every challenge along the way to establishing my **VLSI design career**.
