### Requesting and Gifting on r/GiftofGames  
The r/GiftofGames subreddit allows users to both [request specific games and gift games to strangers](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-cat-gift-for-men-women-girls-boys-feline-kitten-lovers-v-neck-t-shirt/women&) at no cost. While major titles are rare, smaller indie games and game-related items regularly exchange hands between generous community members. MaximumDanâ€™s guide offers tips for respectfully participating. Generosity and gratitude are emphasized over hoarding.
### Browsing Steam's Free-To-Play Section
While not technically "keys", Steam hosts a large collection of completely **free downloadable games without credit cards required**. Users can explore genres like MMOs, co-ops, early access titles and more. What's trending, top sellers and most-played filters help surface quality options. Due to no key exchange, games stay tied to individual Steam accounts.
### Entering Ongoing Game Giveaways 
Dedicated giveaway sites like SteamGifts regularly run **free game and DLC giveaways that anyone can enter** by following simple instructions. Registration may be needed. YouTube channels also offer "key dumps" of random codes. Joining Facebook communities exposes local events. Staying active increases chances of randomly scoring free titles.
### Collecting Free Games During Sales and Promotions  
Publishers occasionally offer select games for a **limited time with 100% discount meaning they become free to own forever**. Starpoint Gemini 2 and Payday 2 recently did this on Steam. Sites like Fanatical and Humble also gift away extras. Subscribing to gaming news keeps users aware of unexpected freebies. First-seen gets rewarded most.
### Earning Points Through Micro Tasks  
Some less popular services allow building credit towards game **keys and marketplace items via time-consuming micro tasks like watching videos and taking surveys**. While mundane, hoarding points over weeks can net that one desired title with patience. Completion rates matter more than speed. Not ideal for everyone's schedule. 
### Following Game Developers on Social Media
Developer Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube profiles regularly run friendly **giveaways for feedback, early access, promotional items and other perks** through simple shares, likes and comments. Staying engaged increases chances of randomly winning without work. Low barrier for entry but high variance in results.
By leveraging these legitimate methods, patient gamers can consistently add quality software and extras to their game libraries every month, all without spending a dime. As always, common sense applies - never share account credentials with untrusted third parties no matter the reward.
