Solids are an important next step in your baby's feeding journey. However, deciding when and how to introduce them can be confusing with conflicting advice. Here are the facts on starting solids based on the latest guidelines and expert recommendations.
## Are You Ready for Solids? 
Before starting solids, ensure your baby shows the following readiness signs:
- Can sit up and hold their head steady.
- Coordinates sucking and swallowing movements.
- Is interested in food and tries to reach for your plate or joins you at mealtimes.
**Baby stomach development** - Around 6 months is best as their stomach and ability to digest **semi-solid foods** has developed sufficiently. Earlier could cause digestive issues.
## Introducing Your Baby's First Foods
For a baby's first foods, choose single **iron-rich cereals** like rice or oat cereal. This allows assessing any food allergies to one ingredient at a time. 
Begin with just 1⁄2-1 teaspoon, increasing slowly based on your baby's tolerance. Cereals can help meet their **iron needs.** Look for an iron-fortified variety to boost iron intake further.
###Starting with Purees
After cereals, introduce one new food every 3-5 days to identify any reactions. Start with simple purees like:
- Sweet potato or butternut squash - Rich in vitamin A and easy to digest. 
- Banana or avocado - Smooth and creamy texture loved by many babies.
- Carrot - High in vitamin A and can help develop your baby's taste for vegetables.
Introduce items one at a time to detect any allergies. Go at your baby's pace and stop if they seem full or refuse more.
## Homemade vs Store-Bought Baby Food
There is no one-size-fits-all approach. Consider these factors in your decision:
- **Homemade purees** allow controlling ingredients, portions, texture. More nutritious but time-consuming to prepare. 
- **Store-bought purees** are convenient for busy parents but may have added sugars, salt or preservatives. Choose varieties labeled "no added.." options.
- For on-the-go feeding, store-bought is ideal but combine with some homemade where possible.
Making even a few purees yourself ensures your baby gets wholesome, freshly prepared nutrients.
## Introducing Lumpier Textures 
Once comfortable with purees, you can start adding textures:
- Gradually thin out purees to gradually thickened consistency. 
- Moisten cereal, vegetables or fruits to a mushy state.
- Small pieces of soft cooked foods like vegetables, paneer or chicken.
Watch for any choking risks and stop if they gag repeatedly. By 8-10 months, most babies can manage pieces 1⁄2 cm in size or smaller.
## Baby Cereal - Should You Consider Cerelac?
Cerelac is a convenient ready-to-use cereal but not essential. Homemade rice cereal is equally nutritious and cheaper. However, Cerelac can be useful when travelling or for convenience. 
Key considerations when using Cerelac:
- It's best introduced after 6 months once babies can handle semi-solid foods well. 
- Start with just 1-2 teaspoons and slowly increase based on tolerance.
- Look for an iron-fortified variety to boost nutrients.
- Constipation can occur in some babies, so offer plenty of fluids and fibre-rich foods too.
## Feeding Schedule and Avoiding Junk Food 
Babies have small stomachs so start with 2-3 small meals and 1-2 snacks per day. Let cue-based feeding guide amounts rather than following a rigid schedule. 
Avoid junk, sugar-rich or heavily salted foods. Stick to freshly prepared home-cooked meals and limit packaged snacks as much as possible. 
Savoury finger foods and self-feeding encourage hand-eye coordination and development. With patience and creativity, mealtimes can spark a lifelong love for healthy, wholesome eating habits.
## Common Concerns When Starting Solids
It's perfectly normal for some babies to reject solids initially or have preferences. Be consistent but don't force-feed. Here are some potential issues:
- **Messy feeding** - Use a bib and keep baby in a high chair. They will get better with practice.
- **Digestive issues** - Slowly increase textures/amounts and offer plenty of fluids to prevent constipation.
- **Baby led weaning** - Only offer finger foods instead of purees. Watch for choking risks but many children thrive with this more independent approach.
Rely on your baby's feeding cues and move at their pace. With time and guidance, most concerns resolve on their own.Consult your paediatrician if issues persist.
