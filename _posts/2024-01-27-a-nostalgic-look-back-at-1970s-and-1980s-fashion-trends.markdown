## The Polyester Years
In the 1970s, synthetic fabrics like polyester dominated clothing choices. Polyester made garments that lasted longer than cotton or wool but came at the expense of comfort and breathability. Many 1970s clothing styles featured bold patterns and bright colors that seemed to reflect the optimism of the period. Pants were tight at the waist then flared out at the legs, giving men **bell-bottom jeans** and women maxi skirts and dresses. 
While polyester proved practical for its durability, the materials felt unnatural against the skin. Most 1970s clothing lacked flexibility compared to natural fibers. Yet fashion trends moved swiftly, so staying on trend meant buying the latest polyester pieces whether they felt good or not. The 1970s proved how quickly synthetic fabrics could take over the market, for better and worse.
### Hippie Style Lives On
Even as disco rose to popularity in the mid-late 1970s, elements of 1960s hippie style endured. Flowy maxi dresses and skirts allowed free movement, reflecting '60s ideals of peace, love and freedom. Loose fitting fabrics draped the body rather than constrained it. Earthy tie-dye and [psychedelic prints](https://store.fi.io.vn/funny-chihuahuas-easter-day-bunny-eggs-easter-costume-womens-chihuahua-dog) captured the psychedelic aesthetic in vivid colors and swirls. For those who continued embracing counterculture, hippie fashion provided a visual expression of those ideals as the decade changed.

## The Need for Speed in the 1980s 
As the 1970s ended, 1980s fashion embraced a new aesthetic defined by excess. Clothing became louder and brighter, almost competing to be seen. The decade favored synthetic materials and radical new silhouettes. While 1970s fashion looked to the past, the **1980s fashion trends** jumped fearlessly into the future. 
### Acid Wash Attitude
In the early 1980s, the breakthrough **acid wash jeans** hit stores. Their lightening effect and faded surfaces made ordinary denim extraordinary. Acid wash jeans quickly became a staple for embracing youth culture. Their comfortable stretch also supported the rise of skateboarding and other action sports. Before long, acid wash expanded to jackets and other clothing in rich indigo shades faded by chemicals. The style showed that denim had untapped potential for self-expression.
### Power Dressing Arrives
As the decade progressed, the business world grew in influence. Power suits defined the 1980s workplace with oversized shoulders, stiff fabrics, and fitted silhouettes. Both men and women tailored their images with professional polish. Dark solids and pinstripes conveyed authority and prestige. Power dressing signified status and success according to dominant social norms. Its severe forms of dressing for business also explored new directions for fashion to take literally and figuratively.
### New Romantics Emerge 
While others dressed for work or play, a romantic movement arose in the UK. New Romantics embraced androgyny, colour, and individualism through flamboyant self-presentation. Lush fabrics, theatrical makeup, and nonconforming styles challenged gender expectations. Popular bands like Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet influenced the New Romantic aesthetic with fanciful videos. Their adventurous spirit showed that self-expression could push societal boundaries in progressive new ways.
## Nostalgia and New Possibilities
Retro fashions of the 1970s occasionally resurfaced even as the 1980s barreled forward. Bell-bottoms and hippie styles enjoyed renewed popularity among some counter-cultural youth. At the same time, innovative 1980s designs like leg warmers, leotards, and lace-trimmed garments broke new boundaries. Fashion in both decades prompted nostalgia while also inciting fresh possibilities for self-identity and social change. Some trends stand the test of time while others exemplify their eras. Overall, 1970s and 1980s clothing provided diverse modes of visual communication still remembered today.
