### Lord Vishnu and His Avatars 
Lord Vishnu is one of the most important Hindu gods and is considered the protector of mankind. [Akshaj](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-forever-poodle-1), **Shriyans**, and **Rajrishi** are some of the many names associated with Lord Vishnu. However, he is best known through his ten main avatars or incarnations that came to Earth to fight evil and restore Dharma. One such famous avatar is **Narasimha**, the half-man, half-lion incarnation who rescued Prahlada from his demon father Hiranyakashipu. To calm the ferocious Narasimha, Lord Shiva appeared in the form of **Sharabeshwarar**, an even mightier incarnation.

He is often depicted as having multiple faces symbolic of his diverse nature. Some of Shiva's less well-known names include **Akul**, which refers to his fierce warrior persona, and **Rishik**, alluding to his role as the ultimate yogi and ascetic. According to legend, after drinking the blood of the demon king Hiranyakashipu, Narasimha's fierce form was calmed by Lord Shiva manifesting as **Sharabeshwarar**. This incarnation demonstrates Shiva's ability to tranquillize even the most violent aspects of reality.

The name **RajaRajar** specifically refers to Vishnu as the god who blesses even Kubera with riches. Notable kings from Hindu epics also had celestial variants, such as **Saket**, one of Lord Krishna's less widespread names. 
### Divine Sages and Their Legacies
