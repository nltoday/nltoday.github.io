### Joining as a Fresh Graduate
When I first joined NTT Data India as a fresh graduate, the onboarding process took around 8 months which was quite long compared to other companies. Once I finally started, I underwent intense Java training for 2-3 months. The training period was very rigorous with weekly tests, mini projects, and a final project. We had classes from 8am to 7pm daily including Saturdays. The stipend provided during the training was also less than other major IT companies. At the end, we had to take a test with 65% cut-off to successfully complete the training. 
While the training was helpful to learn core programming skills, many of us felt that it did not accurately reflect the job roles we would eventually be assigned to. Upon project allocation, only a small fraction received Java projects while most others like myself were placed into different domains where we did not get to apply what we learned during those months of intensive Java training. A handful even ended up in non-technical roles like desk support. Overall, there was a lack of transparency about how projects would be allocated post-training.

### Getting Settled into my First Project  
I was assigned to a [CRM platform modernization](https://yt.io.vn/collection/aldinger) project which was new to me having only learned Java. It involved working with different technologies in an unfamiliar domain. The learning curve was steep initially but colleagues were supportive in helping onboard. The work culture at NTT Data was relaxed with flexible work hours and generous leaves. There was less pressure compared to other companies.
Since the company had recently grown through acquisitions, there were many branches operating independently with their unique policies and cultures. Employees from different project teams and units did not always enjoy equal benefits. Contract assignments across teams were also common instead of permanent transfers. At a policy level, standardization was still underway.
### Opportunities for Learning and Growth
One of the positives of working at a large organization like NTT Data was the wide variety of projects and technologies one could potentially work on over time. With the number of units and clients, there were plenty of opportunities to gain **diverse technical experience** through job rotations if you performed well. You could potentially stand out more easily compared to massive companies and grow your career faster. Challenging assignments were available that helped accelerate learning. 
Working remotely with offshore clients also opened up possibilities for international exposure and **onsite opportunities**, though these remained rare. Leadership positions tended to be held by experienced hires making internal promotions difficult at times. Compensation increments were largely dependent on individual managers rather than set processes. Career paths required persistence and negotiation skills.
### Major Challenges Faced  
A major challenge was the lack of a uniform system across the organization due to its federal structure. Processes like appraisals, benefits disbursal etc. varied per business unit. Since policies were still evolving post-mergers, employees often faced unpredictability. 
It was difficult to assess one's true career potential or negotiate effectively without consistent guidelines. Stringent policies in some branches made transfers complex. Disjointed systems also led to operational inefficiencies at times. 
Though the brand name was prestigious, the experience largely depended on one's allocated team and client. Unsatisfactory projects could stagnate growth. In my case, I had to make multiple requests over a year for a change due to project issues before getting relocated.
Leadership was working to unify disparate parts but full institutional integration would be a long multi-year journey. This transitional ambiguity impacted how the company was perceived by external talent.
### Making the Transition
After working with NTT Data for over 3 years, I decided it was time for a change. While the company offered opportunities to learn new technologies, its federal structure made long-term career planning difficult. 
With years of diverse experience under my belt in multiple domains due to different projects, I felt ready to take the next step. I began exploring other organizations seeking better career trajectories with centralized systems and leadership stability and made the move.  
In conclusion, NTT Data provided a platform to gain valuable hands-on experience for freshers and junior professionals. However, its ongoing phases of post-merger alignment posed challenges for those desiring structured career paths within. The experience varied widely by domain and manager. While a good starting point, one may consider evaluating other options after a few years.
