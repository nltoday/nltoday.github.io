### Protecting Your Connections
Facebook allows users to see mutual friends - those that two profiles share in common. While this helps users expand their networks, it also exposes friend connections that some may want to keep private. [Privacy settings](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/abella) give users control over who can see various parts of their profiles, including friend lists. Adjusting these allows hiding mutual friends from specific people or broad groups.

### Accessing Privacy Options
To manage privacy for mutual friends, first log into your Facebook account. Click your profile picture or name at the top to access your profile page. In the left sidebar, locate the **Friends** section and click through. This opens the friends list. In the top-right, click **"Manage"** to access privacy settings. 
### Choosing a Visibility Level 
A pop-up window titled **"Your Friends"** appears. Several privacy options are available here to determine who can see your friend list and mutual connections. The most restrictive is **"Only Me"** which hides the entire list from others. **"Friends"** limits visibility to your approved Facebook friends. **"Public"** exposes the list to anyone on or off Facebook. For customized control, select **"Custom"** privacy.
### Customizing the List 
Selecting a custom privacy option opens an additional window. Here, determine on an individual basis who can and cannot see parts of your profile. Categories like **Friends of Friends, Specific People, Lists,** and more offer granular controls. Include some and exclude others as preferred. Adjusting the privacy here overrides the general friend list setting selected previously. Custom sharing allows the most tailored approach. 
### Reviewing Changes 
After choosing a privacy level and custom settings, click **"Save Changes"** to apply the new rules. These immediately take effect across your profile. Periodically reviewing privacy controls helps ensure only intended audiences can discover your mutual connections. While full invisibility isn't possible since friends have independent profiles, adjusting your options provides significant protection of potentially sensitive shared friendships.
### Friends' Independent Settings 
While individuals set privacy for mutual friends visibility on their own accounts, friends also make independent choices. Their friend lists may still expose mutual connections publicly regardless of a user's settings due to their preferences. No single person controls how friends present themselves online. Communicating privacy goals can encourage friends to also maintain discretion, but ultimately each profile operates separately. 
### Minimizing Unwanted Exposure 
For the most privacy possible, aim to reduce mutual connections altogether where concerns exist. Unfriend problematic individuals or limit profile access selectively. Regularly removing inactive contacts also trims the profile size and cuts potential exposures. Beyond Facebook's controls, individuals must assess relationships and use discretion carefully sharing personal network details that risk unwanted exposure. Privacy necessitates proactive maintenance from all angles.
### Stays Aware of Changes 
Facebook constantly modifies features and policies. Settings available years ago may differ today. Check Facebook's help center for documentation on current privacy tools. Adjust personal permissions in line with capability shifts. Social platforms evolve rapidly, so users must actively educate themselves and protect profile info accordingly. Being aware lets each person exercise informed control over shared details like mutual friends despite changes outside direct control.
Overall, Facebook offers significant customization ability to protect mutual friend information for privacy-conscious users. Setting visual connections appropriately according to individual needs simply requires logging into the account, accessing the friends list, selecting desired privacy levels and then reviewing as Facebook continues optimizing member security tools.
