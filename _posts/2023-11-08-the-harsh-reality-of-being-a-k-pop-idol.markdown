## Emerging from the Cocoon
The vibrant green meadow was filled with the sweet aroma of spring flowers in full bloom. Underneath a large leaf laid a small cocoon, cracked open to reveal beautiful sea blue wings with intricate black designs. The butterfly rested as her wings dried, then took flight, sparkling in the sunlight among the colorful wildflowers. 
### Naivety and Curiosity
Newly emerged, she remained naive and curious about the big world. As she danced through the sky, her wing caught on a thorny rose bush. In an instant, her fragile wing was torn. Time stopped as she registering the damage, desperately trying to fly with one wing intact. She crashed to the soft grass below.

## An Idol's Journey Begins

### Constant Public Scrutiny
Under the spotlight at all times, idols have their every action dissected and criticized. The public shows no mercy even for minor flaws. This type of constant judgment chips away at even the strongest of mental fortitudes over time.
