TikTok has become one of the most popular social media platforms in recent years. However, like any other accounts, it's possible to forget your username or password over time if you don't use the account regularly. Luckily, TikTok provides several ways for users to recover their account access in such situations. This guide will walk you through the different recovery options available on TikTok.
### Resetting Your Password via Username 
If you remember your TikTok username but forgot the password, you can reset it directly from the login page. Start by going to the TikTok login screen on the app or website. Then click on the question mark icon at the top right corner to open the help section. Select the "Trouble Logging In" option and then choose "Reset by Username". Here, type in your TikTok username and select whether you want the reset link to be sent to your phone number or email address linked to the account. TikTok will then send you a code to reset your password. This is one of the easiest ways to regain access if you only forgot the password.

### Resetting via Linked Social Accounts
TikTok also allows logging in through other social media platforms like Facebook, Google, Apple ID etc. if they are linked to your TikTok account. So if by any chance you have forgotten your TikTok username but remember using one of these linked accounts, you can try logging in through that platform. Once successfully logged in, you will be able to access your TikTok profile and [reset your forgotten password](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/dog-mother). This method can work even if you don't remember the exact TikTok username.
### Resetting via Phone Number 
If you have your TikTok phone number still saved but forgot other login details, you can attempt password reset through SMS. Go to the TikTok login page and tap "Forget Password". Then enter the phone number associated with your account. TikTok will send you a code via text to reset the password. Make sure to double check the phone number is definitely linked before trying this method to avoid linking to the wrong account.
### Deleting Existing Accounts
In some situations, people may have created multiple TikTok accounts by mistake using same details like phone number or email. If you suspect this could be confusing your login attempts, try fully deleting any existing accounts that are not your main one. On both Android and iOS, look for the TikTok app settings to locate the "Delete My Account" option. Once all extra accounts are removed, there will be less conflicts allowing you to potentially recover the right profile. 
### Resetting via Email 
As a last resort, if no other linked platforms or number remember working, try accessing the "Forgot Password" option again but now enter the email id instead if you happen to have the correct one saved from before. TikTok will send a password reset email to regain access. Though this assumes the email is still correctly linked after a long time. Consider contacting TikTok support as well if all options fail.
### Resetting When All Else Fails
If after trying all the above methods and contact support, you are still unable to recover your old lost account, it may be best to simply create a new profile instead of endlessly trying past credentials. Start fresh while learning from past mistakes like noting username and securely saving login details for future ease of access. Over time you can build a new engaging presence and follower base on the platform.
In summary, by using the username/email password reset options, or logging in via alternative linked platforms, it is usually possible to regain control of a forgotten TikTok profile. But sometimes it's also better knowing when it's time to start anew rather than frustrate over something long gone. With the right approach, anyone can continue enjoying TikTok's creative community once more.
