When it comes to building long term wealth, investing in the stock market can be a very lucrative option if done properly. While the market does experience ups and downs in the short term, focusing on solid investment strategies over the long run is key to generating substantial returns. 
In this guide, we will explore 7 simple yet effective strategies inspired by legendary investors like Warren Buffett. Read on to understand how to select quality stocks, stay patient, identify bargains and more - all which can help patient investors achieve their financial goals.
## Pick Businesses, Not Just Stocks
Warren Buffett famously said "When I buy a stock, I think of it in terms of buying a whole company, just as if I were buying a store down the street." Don't just focus on ticker symbols - thoroughly analyze the underlying [businesses](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/adamczyk) you plan to invest in. 
Study factors like the products/services offered, sales and profit track record, competitive landscape, management quality and future prospects. Only invest in companies you'd be comfortable owning for 10+ years regardless of short term price fluctuations. Sticking to industry leaders with strong competitive advantages and growth potential sets the stage for future returns.
## Have Long Term Patience 
If you expect to generate substantial gains, be ready to hold positions for a decade or longer. As Buffett put it, only buy something you'd be happy to hold even if the market shut down for 10 years. Short term thinking won't lead to long term success in investing.
During periods of volatility, remain focused on fundamentals rather than panicking over short term price movements. Quality assets often experience ups and downs before their true value is realized. By staying committed over the long run, you give your investments room to maximize their potential.
## Look for Highly Discounted Situations
While analyzing thousands of potential investments, search for cases where share prices have disconnected significantly from intrinsic business value, presenting "fat pitch" buying opportunities. Valuations offer an edge to patient investors when the markets over- or under-react to events. 
Keep an eye out for **high-quality** companies trading at 50% or more below estimated intrinsic worth. Use valuation tools to target such misunderstood or unloved stocks, giving them time to correct and provide outsized returns as sentiment shifts.
### Manage Resources Efficiently
Evaluate management by studying resource utilization - how efficiently capital, people and assets are employed to drive profits. Look at key metrics like return on equity (ROE), return on invested capital (ROIC) and operating margins to gain insights. 
Well-run companies consistently convert each added dollar of sales into profits, free cash flows and shareholder value over the long term. Management quality impacts organizational efficiency, risk management and capital allocation - all crucial drivers of future performance.

## Avoid "Hot" Stocks and Short Term Noise
Resist chasing stocks generating headlines or hype, and steer clear of those undergoing severe short term volatility. Focus instead on steady, time-tested franchises built to succeed over decades, not days or quarters. 
Tune out daily price movements and short sighted views that focus solely on quarterly results. Adopt the mindset of an owner looking years ahead, as opposed to detached day trader scanning moves intraday. Staying rational helps you take a value-based approach rather than following the herd.
### Calculate Potential Returns
Before committing capital, quantify the potential returns each business could reasonably deliver over the investment period. Solid assumptions for areas like sales growth, profitability improvements and cash generation form the basis for discounted cash flow models and return calculations. 
Set a minimum hurdle rate for profitability - Buffett looks for at least a 10% pre-tax annual return. Potential isn't enough without strong supportable evidence to back it up. This disciplines your analysis and helps distinguish compelling opportunities from the rest. 
## Trim Weak positions, Let Winners Run 
To generate optimal long term performance, focus portfolio assets disproportionately in top performing holdings. Trim or sell losing investments to avoid throwing good money after bad.
Meanwhile, give your best ideas room to exponentially grow in value by not booking premature profits. This asymmetric approach concentrates capital behind managers steadily enhancing shareholder worth over the long run. It also minimizes behavioral biases towards chasing losses or taking profits too early.
### Stay Emotionally Disciplined
Finally, cultivate emotional discipline by developing policies to guard against fear and greed - primal forces sabotaging many investors. Avoid daily price checking which amplifies short term thinking. Set disciplined buy/sell rules to manage risk objectively and let profits run without fear of 'leaving money on the table'. 
Turn off sensational media which promotes fear, uncertainty and doubt. Staying level-headed insulates you from irrational influences like panic selling during corrections or attachment to poor investments. Reason, not emotion, is the ally of the long term investor.
By practicing these time-tested techniques of masters like Warren Buffett, anyone can build substantial wealth through simple yet informed participation in the markets over time. Stay focused on quality, evaluation and patience to generate truly life-changing investment outcomes.
