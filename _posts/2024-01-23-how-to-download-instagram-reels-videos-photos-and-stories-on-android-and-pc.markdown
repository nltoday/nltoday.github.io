### Saving Stories 
Stories from Instagram profiles may disappear after 24 hours, so it's useful to save favorites for keeping. With the tools mentioned, stories are easily downloadable as well. Using KIWI Browser on Android, simply open the profile and stories you wish to keep then click the download button as the story plays. 
On PC, the FastSave, Downloader and iG Downloader extensions all allow downloading Instagram stories straight from the browser.
