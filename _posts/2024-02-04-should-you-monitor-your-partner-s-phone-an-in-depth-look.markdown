After many of my husband's lies and confrontations, doubts started creeping into my mind. Were all of his stories adding up? Who was he really talking to when he was on his phone late at night? My suspicions grew stronger each day until the urge to snoop became too powerful to resist. I had to know the truth, no matter the cost.

With the help of an online phone monitoring service, I was able to intercept my husband's phone calls, messages and social media activity without him knowing. As the tool logged his keystrokes, tracked his location and recorded his screen in secret, I began to uncover a disturbing reality I never could have anticipated. Message threads revealed a deeper relationship than he had admitted, geotags placed him at another woman's home late at night. It was all laid bare before my eyes and I felt my world crumbling.

I calmly reviewed everything documented and looked for patterns and context that may have been missed in the throes of discovery. **A clearer picture emerging monitoring tools** allowed me to get a sense of how long things had been going on and whether there were any other players involved I was unaware of.
