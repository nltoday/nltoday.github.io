## How to Recover Deleted and Old Chats on Discord
Discord allows users to recover their old messages and chat logs through various methods. Here are some step-by-step guides to recover your deleted or past Discord conversations.
### Requesting Your Data Package from Discord
The first method is to directly request your data package from Discord which contains all your account information including past messages. You need to have a verified email connected to your account. Go to Settings > Privacy & Safety > Request all of my data. It may take up to 4 days for Discord to email you the zip file containing your data. Make sure not to share this file with others for privacy and security reasons.

### Searching through Messages Folder 
Once you have downloaded and extracted the zip file, open the "messages" folder. You can use the search bar to find keywords from past messages to locate specific conversations. Right click on the "messages.csv" file and select "Open File Location" to access the conversation metadata files - "channel.json" and "messages.csv".
### Retrieving Channel and Recipient IDs
The "channel.json" file contains the [channel ID](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-girl-who-loves-scotties-scottish-terrier-dog-breed-owner-1) and **recipient IDs** for private chats and group chats. Take note of these IDs as you will need them to access old conversations. Make sure to only share these IDs and not the full file for privacy.
### Looking Up Recipient IDs on Discord Lookup
Head over to Discord Lookup at https://discord.id to search for users using their recipient IDs found in the previous step. This will reveal the username of that user which you can then find and access past private chats with. 
### Accessing Past Private Chats  
Once you find the username of a past private chat recipient, add them as a friend on Discord. This will recover that private conversation for you to view again. You can also directly access past private chats using the channel ID at https://discord.com/channels/@me/<channel_id>.
### Other Ways to Find Deleted Users
If a private chat recipient was completely deleted from Discord, there are still ways to potentially find them. Search your chat log files for "deleted" text to see conversations with deleted users. You can also search through server member lists or messages where that user may have been mentioned before being removed.
## Recovering Group Chats and Closed Conversations
Group chats cannot be directly recovered once left, but there are still options:
### Retrieving Group Chat Recipient List
As mentioned earlier, the "channel.json" file contains a list of all recipient/member IDs for any group chats. Take note of these to potentially re-join conversations. 
### Searching for Group Chat Names 
If you recall the exact name of an old group chat, search for it in the "channel.json" file. Selecting it may re-join you to the conversation if it is still ongoing.
### Finding Chats through Mutual Servers
Check servers you both share(d) for mentions of private or group conversations. Reconnecting with an old recipient on a mutual server can help recover access.
### Tools Like FriendCord  
Third-party executables like FriendCord make retrieving metadata easier but use at your own risk. It allows browsing chat IDs without needing to be logged into an active Discord account.
So in summary, thoroughly searching your chat data, ID metadata and shared connections are the best ways to try recovering chats that are otherwise closed off due to deleted/removed recipients or being removed yourself from group conversations. Perseverance and creativity are key.
## Alternatives When Full Recovery Isn't Possible
Not all past conversations can be recovered through the official Discord method or workarounds. Here are some alternatives:
### Contacting Old Recipient Through Other Means
If you have contact details of an old recipient outside of Discord, communicate with them to see if they have preserved logs that could be shared. Social media profiles are one place to check. 
### Screenshots and Local Backups
Review any screenshots or local chat backups you may have created in the past. Even if incomplete, they provide a record of past interactions.
### Written Notes and Reminders  
Sift through your personal notes, to-do lists, reminders app or even physical journals for any messages or plans discussed in specific chats you want to recall. 
### Asking Third Parties For Information
As a last resort, reach out to any mutual connections on social platforms to ask if they recall or have any context from chats no longer available to you. Someone may refresh your memory.
Don't lose hope if the primary sources are unavailable - think creatively to piece information back together from secondary locations. Full recovery may not happen but alternative routes can still provide context.
## When to Contact Discord Support
Even with the methods outlined, some issues require working directly with Discord:
### Deleted Account Recovery Requests 
If your entire Discord account was deleted, contact support with relevant details for potential reinstatement depending on reasons for closure. 
### Technical Issues Preventing Access 
Reach out if issues like app/server errors are barring you from the methods above. Staff may be able to assist or advise troubleshooting steps. 
### Reports of Cybercrime or Harassment  
Subject to keeping records and evidence, flagged content or threats against you could be addressed through the appropriate channels. 
### General Inquiries on Data and Features  
Pose any other questions on tools, limits or policies to representatives who can provide official clarification and guidance around recovering specific content.
Have patience and be prepared to verify your identity. Discord aims to enable positive experiences so clearly articulate any problems constructively.
## Customer Support Experience and Tips
When contacting companies, keeping interactions polite, organized and solutions-focused helps achieve the best outcomes. Here are some tips for Discord support inquiries:
- Provide all account identifiers (email, username, ID numbers) upfront for quick validation
- Explain requests or issues in a clear, chronological manner with relevant context 
- Remain respectful towards representatives even during frustrating situations
- Try to come prepared with past communication records or evidence files 
- Clarify expectations and next steps if the initial response can’t fully resolve something  
- Thank representatives for their time and feedback even without full resolutions
- Consider alternative routes if certain content or requests cannot legally be granted access to
Following general customer service best practices when working with Discord can result in smoother, more productive dialog to mutually solve challenges around recovering past conversations.
In conclusion, with a combination of the right techniques and tools, along with patience and creativity, recovering deleted or inaccessible Discord messages and conversations is very achievable. Don’t hesitate to leverage the community as well through official channels or third parties when needed.
