When you access a website and see the error message "Your connection is not private" in Google Chrome, it can be annoying and confusing. This article discusses the most common causes of this error and provides solutions to fix it.
## Invalid Date and Time Settings
One of the major reasons for the "Your connection is not private" error is having the [incorrect date and time](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/dog-lover) set on your device. Google Chrome validates SSL certificates based on the certificate's expiration date against the system date and time. If they are mismatched, it will show this error. 
To resolve it, you need to ensure your date and time are accurately synced. On Windows, right-click the time in the taskbar and select "Adjust date/time". On macOS, go to System Preferences > Date & Time and turn on "Set date and time automatically". You can also sync your time with a trusted time server online. Once the date and time are corrected, refresh the problematic pages.
## Antivirus Software Blocking SSL Connections
Your **antivirus program** intercepting and scanning SSL/TLS encrypted connections can also result in the private connection error. Many antivirus apps have a feature to scan SSL traffic for malware, but it may incorrectly block legitimate sites. 
To check, temporarily disable your antivirus and see if the error persists. If it goes away, your antivirus is likely the culprit. Look for any SSL scanning options in the antivirus settings and disable it. As an alternative, you can add trusted sites to the antivirus exclusion list so they are not scanned.
## Expired or Invalid SSL Certificates 
Websites need a valid **SSL certificate** to support HTTPS encryption. If a certificate has expired or is invalidated, Chrome will show the privacy error on the affected domain. Unfortunately, there is nothing users can do in this case except contacting the website admin to renew their certificate.
### Invalid Cookies and Cache Files
Stale or corrupted **cookies, cache files** stored locally by Chrome can also cause the error. Clearing these temporary files resolves many such issues. In Chrome, click the menu icon > Settings > Advanced > Clear browsing data. Select "All time" and check "Cookies and other site data" along with "Cached images and files" before clearing data.

## Outdated or Corrupt Browser Version
An **out-of-date version** of Chrome may have bugs or security vulnerabilities exploited by malicious actors. Similarly, corrupted browser installation due to malware or user errors can cause unpredictable behavior.
To fix, use the built-in update mechanism or download the latest version directly from Google. If updating doesn't work, uninstall and reinstall Chrome completely to get a fresh installation. Back up bookmarks, passwords etc. before reinstalling using Chrome Sync.
## Network/Firewall Configuration Issues 
Company or institution provided networks with restrictive firewall policies can interfere with normal SSL/TLS encrypted connections. The "Your connection is not private" could arise due to such proxy settings blocking certain encryption protocols. 
Contact your network administrator to check firewall rules or try accessing the website using a mobile data connection to bypass any corporate proxies. Using a VPN may also circumvent network-level SSL/TLS inspection causing the error.
## DNS Hijacking or Man-in-the-Middle Attacks 
In rare cases, the privacy error could indicate an ongoing DNS hijacking or man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on your network. Attackers may be intercepting SSL traffic to inject malware or steal sensitive information like login credentials and payment details. 
Take steps to secure your network and devices. Make sure you are using a trusted DNS server and check for any suspicious programs running in the background consuming internet access. Consider running a scan with reputed security software to detect any malware infection causing the SSL visibility issue.
I hope this detailed guide helps you understand the common causes for the "Your connection is not private" error on Google Chrome and provides solutions to fix it. Let me know if you have any other questions!
