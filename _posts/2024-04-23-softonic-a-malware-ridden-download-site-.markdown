Softonic is an enormously popular software download site, however their legitimacy as a safe platform has come under scrutiny. This deep dive analysis seeks to unpack the truth behind claims that Softonic harbors malware and deceives users.
### Profit Through Third Party Advertising & Questionable Reviews  
Softonic makes money primarily through third party advertising on their site. However, it is alleged that to maximize ad revenue, they allow potentially malicious ads and installers. There is evidence some downloads bundle [unwanted additional software installations](https://store.fi.io.vn/funny-video-gamer-xmas-i-paused-my-game-to-be-here-christmas-24/men&), leading to malware. Additionally, as the website owners, Softonic can **remove any negative reviews** while selectively keeping positive feedback, creating a misleading impression of safety.

### Suspicious Usernames and Fake Endorsement Activity
Upon closer examination of Softonic reviews, many flags are raised. Usernames leaving reviews seem **automatically generated** with no personal details. Additionally, reviews use **generic positive statements** like "This app is nice" without substantive comments. This hints Softonic may **generate fake reviews and accounts** to **falsely boost app ratings**. Legitimate reviewers would offer personalized, detailed opinions rather than bland statements.
### Redistributing Freeware Under Their Own Brand
Strangely, Softonic also offers downloads of software freely available directly from developers, like the popular game Roblox. **Rebranding public domain programs under their portal invites skepticism** about true intentions. Legit download sites do not claim ownership over others' freeware. This opportunistic behavior furthers doubts around Softonic's legitimacy.
### reports of infections across the Internet
Alarmingly, many web reports describe contracting malware and viruses through Softonic downloads. Users detail frustrations in **removing persistent infections** post-installation. If Softonic was genuinely providing safe programs from trusted creators, **such widespread infection reports would not proliferate online**. The volume of removal help-seeking indicates **Softonic downloads pose serious security risks.** Legitimate portals do not correlate with multitudes of infection stories.
### Bundling Unwanted Additional Software Raises Flags  
As mentioned, it is alleged Softonic installers **bundle undisclosed additional programs** alongside advertised downloads. By obscuring complete installation contents, users cannot give informed consent to **potentially unwanted software being foisted**. Reputable software distributors fully disclose all bundled components. Softonic's seemingly deceptive, non-transparent practices in this regard further damage credibility.
### Norton Detects Downloads as Malware, Questionable if "Legit" 
The nail in the coffin for Softonic's legitimacy claim was testing their site - anti-virus software Norton blocked and quarantined downloads, identifying threats. For security packages to flag Softonic so consistently implies **a high probability of infection being introduced**. A truly safe platform would invite, not repel protection software. Given all reviewed factors, it is extremely questionable if Softonic can truly be considered a "legitimate" software source.
In summary, when objectively analyzing available evidence, Softonic emerges as a highly suspicious operation not to be trusted with downloads or personal device security. Until transparency into actual business practices and infection rates improves drastically, prudence suggests finding safer portals for legitimate software needs.
