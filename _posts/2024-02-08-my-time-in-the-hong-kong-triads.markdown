### Growing Up in Rural Hong Kong
I grew up in a small rural village in Hong Kong in the 1980s. Living in the countryside was very different from the bustling city - our community had a tight-knit feel and people looked out for one another. However, it also meant that there was little oversight from authorities. Many of the boys I knew in school felt disenfranchised and sought belonging through local [street gangs and triads](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/abdallah).
In high school, I befriended a group who seemed cool and tough. They introduced me to drinking, fighting, and low-level crimes. It was exciting at the time and gave me a sense of purpose. My friends' older brothers were involved in one of the major **Hong Kong triad organizations** operating in our area. They started mentoring us and bringing us around for "jobs".

### Getting Involved in the Bootlegging Business 
By my late teens, I had risen up the ranks and was directly working under one of the **triad lieutenants**. My role was in the booming business of pirated media - CDs, DVDs, and software. This was before widespread internet piracy so the demand was huge. We would manufacture thousands of copies each day in underground factories.
The profit margins were incredible, around **5000% markup** on costs. It became the primary revenue stream for the entire organization. With my technical skills, I helped streamline production and logistics. In return, I received a hefty cut of the earnings. For a young man with nothing, it was easy money. I spent it all on cars, clothes, women, and drugs to impress my friends.
### Moving Up the Ranks of the Organization
My success in the bootlegging ring caught the eye of higher-ups. Within a year, I was personally introduced to one of the top **triad bosses** in the region during an elaborate annual company dinner. It was there that I realized just how large-scale the whole operation was, with politicians and police among the guests. 
I was then formally initiated as a **low-level soldier**. The boss took me under his wing, grooming me for bigger responsibilities. I worked closely with him running numerous other criminal rackets like loan-sharking, gambling, and extortion "protection fees" across different districts. It was a heady time - I had money, power, respect, and was untouchable in the community.
### Initiation and Indoctrination  
The initiation ritual involved traditional triad symbols while we swore a "blood oath" of secrecy and loyalty. This was followed by a steep indoctrination process to ensure complete obedience and silence when facing interrogation. 
We were drilled on triad protocols, etiquette, ranks, and the complex relationship with authorities. There was also physical training and lessons in acting calmly under pressure. The goal was to transform us from rowdy street thugs into controlled criminal operatives who blended into society unnoticed.
### Gang War and Near-Death Experience
Tensions had been rising for months between our faction and a rival gang. It erupted into all-out warfare over turf disputes. Our boss had us mobilize to defend key locations, arming us heavily. The night of an attack on one of our offices was chaotic and terrifying. We fought for our lives with any weapon available. 
I still have nightmares recalling the blood-spattered frenzy. One of their men died and I ended up in jail, fearing retaliation. It was then that I realized this life wasn't worth it. The paranoia, violence, and possibility of an early death finally broke through my youthful delusions of power.
### Escaping the Triads and Starting Over
After getting released, I wasted no time cutting all ties and disappearing. Leaving was no simple matter - there are severe consequences for betrayal. With help from concerned relatives, I fled overseas with just a backpack. It took years to mentally and emotionally recover from the trauma.
Eventually, I rebuilt my life through education in a new country far from that world. Today, I have a family and use my experience helping troubled youth avoid the same mistakes. My greatest hope is that others may find healthier paths forward too.
# My Time in the Hong Kong Triads
### Growing Up in Rural Hong Kong
I grew up in a small rural village in Hong Kong in the 1980s. Living in the countryside was very different from the bustling city - our community had a tight-knit feel and people looked out for one another. However, it also meant that there was little oversight from authorities. Many of the boys I knew in school felt disenfranchised and sought belonging through local **rural street gangs and secret societies**. 
In high school, I befriended a group who seemed cool and tough. They introduced me to drinking, fighting, and committing petty crimes. It was exciting at the time and gave me a sense of purpose. My friends' older brothers were involved in one of the major **Hong Kong triad organizations** operating in our area. They started mentoring us and bringing us around for "jobs" on the weekends.
### Getting Involved in the Lucrative Bootlegging Business
By my late teens, I had risen up the ranks among the younger members and was directly working under one of the top **triad lieutenants** in our neighborhood. My role within the organization focused on running their booming underground business - pirating music, movies, software and distributing thousands of copies on burned CDs and VCDs each week. 
This was in the late 90s/early 2000s before widespread Internet piracy so the demand for pirated media was massive. We would manufacture copies around the clock in hidden underground factories. The profit margins were incredible, around **5000% markup** on production costs. It became the primary revenue stream sustaining the entire local operation. With my technical skills and fluency with computers, I helped streamline production workflows and logistics chains. In return, I received a hefty cut of the weekly earnings. For a young man with nothing, it was easy money. I spent it all on fast cars, flashy clothes, expensive women, and hard drugs to gain respect among my peers.
### Rapid Ascent Through the Ranks 
My success in exponentially growing the profits of the bootlegging ring soon caught the eye of higher ranking bosses within the wider organization. Within just one year, I was personally introduced to one of the most influential **triad bosses** heading our regional division during an elaborate annual company awards dinner. It was there that I first realized the truly large scale and complex hierarchy that our "business" encompassed, with local politicians and police chiefs spotted among the guests.
I was then formally initiated as a **full soldier** and took an oath of secrecy. The boss took a strong liking to my skills and initiative. He groomed me personally to take on more management roles, handing me control over certain rackets across multiple districts, like enforcing "protection payments" from local store owners, unlicensed gambling dens, and high-interest loan sharking operations. It was a heady time of both responsibility and corrupted power. I felt untouchable with money and men at my command.
### A Near-Death Initiation and Bloody Gang War
The initiation to become a full soldier involved intricate traditional triad rituals and symbols while taking a "blood oath" of secrecy and lifetime service. This was followed by intensive indoctrination to ensure obedience and withstand police interrogations if ever arrested. 
We were drilled relentlessly on triad rules, protocols, etiquette, hierarchies as well as taught to always remain calm and controlled in times of crisis. There was also physical training in martial arts and handling firearms. The goal was to shape us from undisciplined street thugs into professional criminal operatives who could blend into society unnoticed.
Tensions had been rising for months between our faction and a rival local gang, fighting over territorial control. It finally erupted into an all-out bloody gang war across entire neighborhoods. As our manpower was severely depleted, our boss had all available members mobilize and heavily arm ourselves to defend key locations from enemy attacks. The night they tried storming one of our headquarters was chaotic horror beyond any movie. We fought for our lives against the intruders using anything we could get our hands on as weapons. 
I still have nightmares recalling the vivid details - the blood spattered walls and floors, dismembered bodies, the mad screams and feral fighting. One of their men died from his wounds and I ended up arrested, fearing retribution attacks if any of their members recognized me in jail. This was the first time that living this life of crime no longer seemed worth it to me. The perpetual paranoia, horrific violence, and real threat of an early death finally broke through my youthful delusions of power, money and brotherhood.
### Escaping the Triads and Starting a New Life
After my release through connections, I wasted no time cutting all ties and disappearing without warning. Leaving such a powerful criminal organization was no simple feat - there are severe consequences for betrayal, from beatings to potential assassination attempts. With help from concerned relatives overseas, I hastily fled the country with just a backpack of possessions, unsure of what new dangers might be pursuing me. 
It took me years to mentally recover and heal from the trauma of my past experiences. Eventually through education in my new home, I slowly rebuilt a normal life. Today, I have a loving family and use my real world experience helping counsel troubled
