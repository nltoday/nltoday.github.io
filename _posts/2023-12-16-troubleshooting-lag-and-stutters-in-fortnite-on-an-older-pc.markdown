### Understanding the Specs
With specs of an i7-4700 CPU, 16GB of RAM, a 250GB SSD with 1TB HDD for storage, and a GTX 760 graphics card, this PC is capable of running Fortnite. However, it is on the lower end of recommended specifications. The i7-4700 CPU is now over 8 years old, and while still capable, it is not as powerful as newer processors. The GTX 760 GPU is also quite dated, released in 2013, and Fortnite has come a long way in terms of graphics requirements since then. With new seasons and maps, the game is more demanding than ever before on hardware.

### Rule out Firewall and Security Issues
Before jumping to conclusions about outdated hardware, it's important to rule out any software issues that could be causing lag or stuttering. The poster should check their firewall and ensure Fortnite has full access through it. Security software like antivirus can sometimes interfere as well, so temporarily disabling it while testing Fortnite performance is a good idea. Malware and viruses are another potential culprit, so running a full scan is advised.
### Cleaning Out Dust Buildup
On an older system that has been in use for many years, dust buildup is practically inevitable. This accumulated dust acts as poor insulation, preventing heat from escaping efficiently. With restricted airflow, components will run hotter under load from games like Fortnite. This excess heat causes [thermal throttling](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-holiday-lights-santa-shih-tzu-dog-christmas-tree-3), where the processor or graphics card downclocks to stay within safe temperature limits. Unfortunately, lower clocks mean worse performance and potential stuttering or lag. A thorough cleaning of the interior, fans, heatsinks and fan grills can make a big difference for thermal performance.
### Checking Power Supply Functionality
As PCs age, other parts like the power supply may begin to show their age as well. An struggling power supply that is degrading could have issues supplying stable voltage to components under heavy gaming loads. One way to check is by feeling if the power supply gets abnormally hot during gameplay. Excessive heat output is a sign efficiency has reduced, limiting how much power components receive. An aging PSU replacement may be needed to ensure stable performance.
### Optimizing Software and Services
Of course, dust and hardware failures aren't the only possible culprits. Bloatware, unnecessary background services and general software clutter can hog precious system resources. The OS and installed software take up space on the SSD/HDD as well over time. A thorough cleanup using uninstallations and a utility like CCleaner can help optimize disk space and tweak the software environment for better gaming performance. Disabling startup programs, services and updating drivers are other tips.
### Considering a Hardware Upgrade
In some cases, hardware simply becomes obsolete for newer titles over the years. The GTX 760 may struggle at maintaining a steady framerate in Fortnite on higher settings with its dated architecture. A moderate GPU upgrade, such as to a GTX 1050 Ti or 1650, could help boost performance significantly within a modest budget. The i7-4700 CPU still has potential but an SSD upgrade may also be worth considering for faster load times and general snappiness if needed. With some maintenance and selective upgrades, lag can be minimized for enjoying Fortnite on an older system.
