### Accepting Thousands Of Requests
LazarBeam, a popular Australian gaming YouTuber, uploaded a video in 2018 where he accepted over 1,700 friend requests in Fortnite. In the video, LazarBeam's friends list quickly fills up but he is still able to continue accepting incoming requests. This suggests that the friend limit must have been significantly higher than 1,700 at the time.

### Early Reports Of A 500 Friend Cap
Some early discussions from around mid-2018 mention that the Fortnite friend limit used to be around 500 friends. However, as the game grew in popularity amongst streamers and content creators, the need to add more subscribers and viewers as friends likely led Epic Games to increase the cap. [streamers](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-doberman-dog-face-pup-pet-puppy-lover-best-dad-mom-ever-v-neck-t-shirt/men&) and content creators rely on growing their friends lists to engage further with their communities. With a cap of only 500 friends, it would be very limiting.
### Players Now Having Thousands Of Friends 
Jumping to the present time, if you search gaming forums, you'll find many players claiming to have thousands of friends on their Fortnite friends list. Some specific examples mentioned having over 8,000 pending requests or receiving 6,000 requests in a single day. The general consensus seems to be that the hard limit, if there is one, must now be several thousand friends high.
### No Known Official Cap Number
While Epic Games has not publicly stated an exact number for the Fortnite friends cap, the evidence points to there being a much higher limit now compared to early 2018. It appears there is flexibility to scale up depending on the needs of different account types, like creators. The key takeaway is that under normal usage, the average player is very unlikely to ever realistically hit the limit.
### Friends List Performance Depends On Hardware 
When diving into gaming subreddits to discuss the friend limit, another factor that comes up is how well a player's individual hardware can handle an extensive friends list. While the server-side limit may be in the thousands, **PC performance** can begin to struggle with loading and interacting with a friends list beyond several thousand names. Slower hardware in particular may encounter lag or crashing. So the practical limit ends up varying by machine specifications as well.
### Testing Extreme Limits For Educational Purposes
Some dedicated Fortnite fan accounts on YouTube and Twitch have conducted experiments hitting extreme limits just to discover where Epic Games may potentially cut off additional requests. One notable example pushed over 15,000 friend requests accepted in a single sitting. While the account was able to continue adding at a rapid pace, performance of the friends list did slow down noticeably at that high volume. 
### Key Takeaways On The Evolving Fortnite Friend Limit
In summary, the Fortnite friends list capacity has grown tremendously since initial restrictions of 500 friends in early 2018. Most recent evidence points to server-side limits now being in the thousands rather than hundreds. The true ceiling is not public knowledge. Individual **PC performance** also plays a role once friend counts exceed several thousand. For normal gameplay, exceeding 1,000 friends would be exceptionally rare. But for top creators, maintaining engagement through large social networks is certainly supported.
### Does The Limit Really Matter For Casual Players?
For the average Fortnite player who is not a major content creator, does reaching the maximum friend limit really matter? Truthfully, no - it shouldn't impact normal gameplay at all. Unless a player participates in massive follow/subscriber drives, staying below 1,000 or even 500 friends is more than reasonable. Focus should remain on finding a circle of close friends to regularly squad up with rather than worries over arbitrary capacity numbers. Enjoy the game!
