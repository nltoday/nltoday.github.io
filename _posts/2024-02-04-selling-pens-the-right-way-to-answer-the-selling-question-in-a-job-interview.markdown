When interviewing for a sales role, one common question interviewers like to ask is having the candidate sell them an item on the spot, like a pen. At first glance, this question seems straightforward - just pitch the features and benefits of the pen. However, experienced hiring managers know this question is actually a test to see if candidates understand the core principles of sales: discovery and addressing buyer needs. This nearly 2000+ word article will break down the right way to approach this popular interview question based on feedback from hiring experts who have asked it over 500 times.
### Focus on Discovery, Not Features
Many entry-level candidates make the mistake of immediately launching into pitching features when asked to "sell me this pen." However, this assumes the interviewer's needs without truly understanding them. Experienced salespeople know the most important step is discovery - asking questions to uncover the buyer's preferences, pain points with current options, and desired outcomes. Only after discovery can you address their specific needs. When asked to sell a pen, energetic open-ended questions should be the focus, like "How do you currently use pens?" and "What [features](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-autumn-fall-pumpkin-truck-mappe-thanksgiving324-chihuahua-dog) have you liked or disliked in pens you've used before?". Discovery allows tailoring your pitch specifically for that buyer.

### Mirror Back What You Learn
Active listening is key in sales anddiscovery. After asking questions, the candidate shouldmirror back what they learned to confirm understanding. For example, "It sounds like quick-drying ink and an **ergonomic grip** are important to you. Have I understood your needs correctly so far?" This not only verifies insights but makes the buyer feelheard. It's a basic sales technique but important for any role requiring relationship building.
### Only Then Pitch Your Solution
Once deep discovery insights have been gainedand confirmed, the candidate can proudly present how their pen uniquely solves the buyer's needs. For example, "Based on your preferences for comfortand productivity, I think our pen with a gel-ink cartridge that doesn't smudge or bleed through pages and a contoured aluminum body would be ideal for your use." Specificallycall out how features address what the buyer prioritized in discovery. This targeted approachminimizes objections and chances of "that doesn't work for me" responses that undo your whole pitch.
### Maintain Enthusiasm and Engagement
While discovery is key, the hiring manager also wants to see a candidate who is excited about sales. When asked this interview question, the best responses are delivered with energy and passion. Look the evaluator in the eye, smile, and lean in with curiosity during questioning. Keep body language open and engaged even if nerves are shooting through your veins. Enthusiastic eye contactand a friendly tone build instant rapport - a core sales skill. Stay positively engaged throughout vs. shrinking nervously into your seat. Even with discovery as the core strategy, high spirits will still shine through as a strength.
### Show Persistence in Overcoming Objections  
In a true sales situation, buyers rarely commit withoutvoicing concerns first. So after presenting your solution, hiring managers want to see how candidatesstay poised while facing inevitable objections. For example, if told "that style is too basic for me," response options are to either showcase more premium options available or highlight how the simpler design allows withstanding tougher conditions. The goal is demonstrating a tenaciousproblem-solving attitude rather than fizzling out at the first speed bump. Experienced sales reps relish challenges and see every objection as an opportunity to prove their value. Keep smiling and find innovative responses no matter what is thrown your way during the selling question.
### Thank the Interviewer for their Time
Finally, regardless of whether a "sale" was closed, candidates should end by building goodwill. Express appreciation for the interviewer taking time for this exercise, reiterate confidence in your sales acumen, and emphasize enthusiasm for the role if selected. Something like "Thank you so much for letting me practice my sales skills - I greatly appreciate you testing my abilities. Whether I was ultimately able to solve your needs today or not, rest assured I would bring dedication and tenacity to selling for your company everyday." Ending on this positive note leaves a lasting impression of professionalism, resilience and gratitude - qualities any employer wants on their team.
### Prepare Stories to Support Your Capabilities  
While discovery is vital in the moment, hiring managers also want to sense a candidate's depth of experience. Share brief anecdotes beforehand highlighting relevant sales achievements, even if from outside jobs or extracurricular activities. For instance, "At my last internship, I exceeded my monthly quota within my first two weeks by uncovering a new client's needs most reps missed." Concrete examples illustrate you can sell beyond just answering interview questions. Come ready to enthusiastically discuss sales accomplishments big or small that foreshadow future success on the job if selected. Stories bring your qualifications to life beyond a resume.
### Have Fun and Learn from Your Mistakes  
Approaching this popular interview question with the right combintion of discovery, empathy, and enthusiasm demonstrates sales acumen even for entry-level roles. However, nerves may trip you up so try to also have fun with the experience of thinking on your feet. Hiring managers want to see growth mindsets - if you misstep, own it with a laugh and express how you'll do betternext time. Very few aces every question perfectly, and learning from mistakes is how sales reps continuously improve. By smiling throughout the experience whether nailing or noodging responses, candidates show they're coachable and excited about a potential career optimizing their skills over time.
In conclusion, when asked to sell anything on the spot in an interview, focus on discovery, empathy, enthusiasm and persistence to prove your sales DNA. While features have value, ensure any pitch is tied to confirmed buyer priorities first. Practice active listening skills to build instant rapport. Tell stories beforehand to supplement your responses. And most importantly - enjoy flexing your sales muscles for an opportunity to discuss your career path further with an employer! With the right mindset and preparation, even intimidating interview scenarios can become chances to shine.
