### Signing up and Applying
After graduating from college, I was eager to gain some experience and build up my resume while waiting for my job to start. I decided to sign up for Internshala to explore opportunities. The signup and application process was straightforward - I created a profile, uploaded my resume and started browsing listings. 
I came across [content writing internships](https://store.fi.io.vn/i-like-my-chihuahua), **work from home options** and other roles I was interested in. Applying was as simple as clicking "Apply" and attaching my documents. Internshala made it very **convenient to browse, find and apply** for roles from the comfort of my home. Within a few days, I started receiving responses and getting shortlisted for interviews.

### The Good: A Positive Volunteer Experience
One of the first opportunities I got was an unpaid **volunteering role** with an organization called Simply Blood. They were transparent about it being unpaid from the start. My task was to write one article about blood donation which I completed. 
While it was quite simple with no stipend, I appreciated Internshala and Simply Blood for being upfront. I also received a certificate from Internshala for getting this role, which was nice. This experience showed me the potential of finding opportunities through the platform.
### The Bad: Manipulation and Lack of Clarity
Soon after, I landed another role for a **content marketing internship** with a company called "Junkart". However, things took a turn. 
They asked me to shortlist and manage other applicants but were very unclear about pay, saying it was **"performance based"**. When others asked for clarity, the representative rudely said there was no stipend. I realized it was all manipulation to get free work. 
I complained to Internshala and they promptly took down the listing, showing they addressed issues seriously. This experience highlighted the risks of **unclear compensation structures** and lack of transparency from some employers.
### Striking Gold: A Positive Paid Experience  
While dealing with the Junkart fiasco, I also got selected for another role with "Plant Writer". The representative Jaison mentioned a **â‚¹3,000 monthly stipend** upfront.
I worked hard on research-heavy articles but the paranoid thoughts from before crept up. However, Jaison was understanding when I expressed concerns. True to his word, he paid my stipend on time along with an offer to provide references - proving some employers delivered on their promises through **clear communication and integrity**.
### The Ugly: Getting Scammed and Lack of Support
Unfortunately, not all ended well. I once took up a one-month software internship with a 30k stipend listed on Internshala. However, after 2 weeks of hard work developing their website, the company **disappeared without paying me**.
When I complained, Internshala's complaint process was pathetic. No one responded to calls or emails, and they eventually took the company's side by asking me to handle it alone. This exposed the platform's **lack of accountability** towards interns being exploited. It left a very bitter taste. 
### Conclusion: Lessons Learned
While Internshala introduced me to opportunities, my experience was a mixed bag. I appreciate them addressing issues promptly sometimes but more can be done to **protect applicants from scams**. 
In future, I will be more diligent verifying employers independently. Internshala needs tighter verification for listings to establish trust. With the pros and cons, it remains a good starting point - if used cautiously.
