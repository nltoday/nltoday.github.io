### Getting Started for Cheap
To introduce some [affordable multiplayer games](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-summer-vintage3422-t-shirt) for new gamers on a budget, **Unturned** stands out as a **free-to-play sandbox survival game** reminiscent of Minecraft and DayZ. With no story, it focuses on crafting, scavenging and cooperating or competing with other players in its open world. As a free option, it provides endless hours of fun exploring procedurally generated maps without cost barriers.

### A Classic Sandbox to Get Lost In
Another early recommendation is **Garry's Mod**, famous for its diverse game modes and continued popularity over years. As a sandbox, it gives creative freedom to build whatever scenes and games you can imagine. For under $10 during a sale, the endless community content ensures you'll never run out of fresh experiences. My friend still plays regularly after racking up 1000 hours, so it offers phenomenal value for the price. 
### Dig, Fight, Build, a Low-Cost Co-op Journey  
Moving on from sandboxes, **Terraria** presents a charming 2D adventure that progresses as you mine deeper and craft better gear to take on tougher enemies. Unlike its label as a "2D Minecraft," the meatier RPG elements around bosses and biomes set it apart. At its low price point, you can embark on this co-op experience with friends for minimal individual investment but maximum shared fun leveling up together.
### A Competitive Shooter to Master on a Budget
For those seeking a competitive multiplayer experience, **Rainbow Six Siege** debuted at a higher $60 but regularly goes on sale for under $15. As a tactical shooter, it has a higher learning curve than run and gun games but rewards coordination with friends immensely. Though initially grindy without the full operator roster, it incentivizes improving your skills over superficial progress. For the right group, it delivers astounding replayability for its low sale price.
### Low-Budget Open World Mayhem 
Major series like **Grand Theft Auto V** can also dip below $15 during big annual sales. As one of the best selling games ever, it provides an expansive living world to run amok in with friends. From cooperative missions to competitive modes, its breadth of content ensures you'll keep finding new ways to have fun together for dozens of hours before exhausting everything on offer. For the price of a meal out, it's a true bargain at those sale prices.
### A Challenging Co-op Journey Through the Undead
Those seeking an extra layer of difficulty in their cooperative gaming may appreciate **Dark Souls III** when it hits a major sale discount. As an action RPG set in a gloomy fantasy world, mastering its punishing but fair combat system with phantoms by your side provides a real sense of accomplishment few other games can match. Even solo, the online elements keep things engaging through messages and glimpses of other players. Its rich lore and gameplay keep it compelling during repeat playthroughs.
### Conclusion
In summary, the selection above presents a variety of affordable multiplayer games that can each provide dozens or hundreds of hours of enjoyment when played with friends locally or online. By waiting for sales on titles like GTA V, Dark Souls III or Rainbow Six Siege, you can access typically premium experiences for under $15 to share adventures together at very reasonable individual cost. Meanwhile, always-affordable options in Unturned, Garry's Mod and Terraria ensure new gamers need not break the bank for their first tastes of online cooperative and competitive gaming fun.
