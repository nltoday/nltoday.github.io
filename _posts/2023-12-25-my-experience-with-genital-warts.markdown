As an anonymous person, I'd like to share my experiences with genital warts over multiple visits to different doctors in order to help others. 
### Seeking Help
It all started in winter 2007-2008 when I suddenly felt terrible pain in my penis after ice skating with my partner. I had no idea where the pain came from but it paralyzed me. We went straight to the private hospital where I worked to see a doctor. 
After waiting in line, I met with a young and attractive female doctor who was freshly graduated. Being in her presence while having to show her my private area was undeniably embarrassing and nerve-wracking, especially with my partner waiting outside. However, the doctor remained fully professional as she examined my penis carefully with gloved hands, finding nothing abnormal. Blood tests also came back clear, so it seemed to have been a temporary issue.

### Multiple Treatments 
A few years later, I discovered [uncomfortable genital warts](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-jack-chi-dog-bacon-lover-t-chihuahua-dog) had developed. I went to a nearby clinic where a sympathetic male doctor said he could remove them using liquid nitrogen. After the first freezing treatment which hurt a bit, the warts returned within two weeks. 
I went back and saw another sympathetic male doctor who did the same procedure, but again the warts rebounded. On the third try, I saw a female doctor who was less than sympathetic. She ground the frozen cotton swab ruthlessly into each wart as if trying to dig craters, causing me to flinch in pain. Despite hating her approach, thankfully the warts did not return after her treatment.
### Understanding Different Experiences
Looking back, I don't fault the professionals for their varying styles - a doctor's priority is solving the medical issue. Any initial thoughts that gender may impact bedside manner were simply misguided prejudices. 
While some doctors are gentler than others, what really matters is effective treatment. I'm grateful each physician tried their best to resolve my problem, even if their "tactics" differed. Receiving care from professionals of any gender is a privilege; their goal is our wellbeing, not pleasantries.
### Sharing to Help Others 
I tell this anonymous story to normalize discussing intimate health issues. Many endure such experiences alone due to embarrassment, but sharing can encourage others to seek necessary medical attention sooner. Early detection and multiple opinions served me well through persevering treatment.  
If my story helps just one person realize there is no need for shame, and that compassionate help is out there, then it was worthwhile to relate. Our wellbeing should take priority over momentary discomfort or judgments that likely aren't even occurring. I hope others find relief and healing as I did.
### Moving Forward with Gratitude  
Looking back now with maturity and perspective, I feel only gratitude for each doctor who tended to me - whether through gentle or firm methods, sympathy or stoicism. Their varied approaches helped resolve the issue, and that is what mattered most. 
While health challenges are never easy, reflecting on how far we've come builds appreciation. I'm in a loving, committed relationship and living a full life. My experiences with **genital wart treatment** feel far in the past. Most importantly, I learned not to make assumptions and am no longer afraid to seek medical help whenever needed.
