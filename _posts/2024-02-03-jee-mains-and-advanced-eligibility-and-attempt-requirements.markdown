## Preparing for the Biggest Engineering Exams of India
Engineering entrance exams like JEE Main and JEE Advanced conducted by NTA are the gateway to top engineering colleges in India. With millions of aspirants appearing each year, it takes dedication and strategic planning to maximize one's chances of selection. In this article, let us understand the key eligibility criteria and number of attempts allowed to appear for these exams.
### Understanding the Exam Pattern and Structure 
JEE Main is the national level competitive test for admission to [undergraduate engineering programs](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/alas) in NITs, IIITs, and other centrally funded technical institutions. It is also a screening test for JEE Advanced which is conducted for admission to **B.Tech programs** offered by the prestigious Indian Institutes of Technology(IITs). **JEE Main score** determines an applicant's eligibility for appearing in JEE Advanced while **JEE Advanced rank** decides the college and course allocation.

### Eligibility to Appear in JEE Main 
To be eligible to sit for JEE Main, the candidate must have passed the class 12th/equivalent examination in 2019, 2020 or 2021 with **Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics** as compulsory subjects. **Those appearing for 12th exams** in 2022 can also register for JEE Main 2022 but their application will only be considered if they pass 12th by the counselling process. There is **no age restriction**.
### Number of Attempts for JEE Main
An applicant can attempt JEE Main for a maximum of **three consecutive years** after passing class 12th. The number of attempts were increased to four in 2021 due to COVID-19. However, from 2023 onwards it is proposed to reduce back to two attempts per year totalling to **six attempts over three years**. If a candidate doesn't appear for all attempts in these years, the left out attempts are forfeited. 
### Eligibility Criteria for JEE Advanced 
Only Top 2,50,000 successful JEE Main qualified candidates are eligible to appear for JEE Advanced based on their **JEE Main ranks, category and available seats**. To be eligible for JEE Advanced, the candidate must have passed class 12th/equivalent exam in 2020, 2021 or 2022 only with **Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics**.
### Number of Attempts for JEE Advanced
An applicant is allowed a **maximum of two attempts** in two consecutive years for appearing in JEE Advanced. For example, if not qualified in 2022, one can again appear in 2023 but the next attempt has to be within this period only. After 2023, the applicant has to forego the available attempt if not availed in consecutive years.
## Planning the Attempt Strategy Wisely
With the understanding of exam patterns and number of attempts for JEE Mains and Advanced, it is important for aspirants to strategize their preparation and attempt plans carefully. Taking a drop to focus solely on studies without distractions can increase chances for some. Alternatively, concurrent preparation while in 12th is also adopted by many top scorers. Overall, self-evaluation and subject proficiency should determine the best attempt strategy for each individual. Consistent practice, doubt removal and solving previous year questions are absolute musts irrespective of the plan. By making the most of available attempts and prioritizing exam readiness over anything else, one can maximize selection chances in IITs and other top NITs through these gateway tests.
