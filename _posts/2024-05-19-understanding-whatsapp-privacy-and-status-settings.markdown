## Checking WhatsApp Profile Status 
WhatsApp provides users with various privacy settings to control who can see their profile information like profile photo, last seen status and online status. If you can see another user's profile photo and last seen status on WhatsApp, it usually means they have not blocked you from viewing this information. **However, users now have more granular control over privacy through the recent WhatsApp updates.**
### Controlling Profile Visibility 
Under the Privacy settings in the latest WhatsApp version, users can selectively hide their profile photo, last seen, online status and even blue tick receipts for specific contacts. **This gives users flexible privacy options to share information with some contacts but not others.** For example, one can allow work contacts to see when they were last online but hide this from personal contacts for better work-life balance.

### Hiding Status Updates
In addition to profile visibility settings, WhatsApp also allows muting status updates from specific contacts. If you are unable to see another user's status updates for a prolonged time, it is likely they have hidden their status from you using this privacy feature. However, there is no direct way to determine who all a user may be hiding their status from.
## Understanding WhatsApp Status Visibility 
### Asking Third Parties is Risky
Some may be tempted to ask mutual contacts for screenshots to check someone's status visibility. However, this approach has privacy and security risks. WhatsApp is committed to user privacy and does not support workarounds to discover hidden status information. 
### Respecting Privacy Settings 
The ability to selectively hide status is a privacy feature intended for users, not a way to snoop on others. If a contact's status is not visible to you, the best approach is to respect their privacy settings rather than try to circumvent them. Unless there is a valid concern, it is better to avoid overanalyzing status visibility issues.
### Focusing Inwards Not Outwards 
Everyone has the right to manage their online presence as they choose. **Instead of obsessively tracking how others use privacy settings, it is wiser to focus on inner peace.** Work on being at peace with yourself so that you do not depend on others for validation or feel troubled by what you cannot see. Choose to leave people alone if their status is hidden from you.
## Common Myths About Status Visibility
While status visibility settings provide useful privacy, they have also led to some misunderstandings. Let's address a few common myths:
### Myth 1: Hidden Status Means Being Blocked
Simply hiding status from someone does not mean the contact has been blocked. Blocking disables all communication, whereas hidden status only affects the status feature. A contact can still message you even if you cannot see their status updates.
### Myth 2: Third Party Apps Can Reveal Hidden Statuses  
Some claim third party apps can circumvent privacy settings and reveal hidden statuses. However, WhatsApp does not support any method to discover hidden status information outside of its app. Third party apps pose privacy and security risks to user accounts.
### Myth 3: Asking Mutual Friends Violates No Privacy
While seemingly harmless, getting status screenshots through mutual contacts amounts to secretly monitoring someone else's privacy settings without consent. The considerate approach is to avoid such means and respect others' privacy choices.
## In Summary
In this digital age, social media users have more control over how they share and receive information through customized privacy settings. While settings can lead to questions, the wise path is to focus on self-improvement instead of tracking others' actions. Ultimately, we must learn to feel at peace regardless of what others choose to reveal or hide.
