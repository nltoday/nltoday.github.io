### Receiving an Emergency Call 
It was a busy night shift at the small local community hospital in 1982. The medical staff was assisting patients as usual when suddenly an highly unusual overhead page came through "Any surgeon in the hospital, please report to the ER STAT." This brought an uneasy silence among the crew as such urgent calls were very rare. About 20 minutes later, one of the young [respiratory therapists named Jim](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/agosta) entered in a visibly distraught state. He shared that an emergency involving a severe vehicle accident required immediate surgical support.

### A Horrific Injury
Jim explained that a young man in his twenties was hit by a car while walking. What made the situation even more catastrophic was that the vehicle had a large protruding **hood ornament** which caused devastating injuries as it sliced through his body from the groin all the way up to the chest upon impact. Despite the injuries, responders were somehow able to start an IV and hang blood transfusions to keep the man alive upon arriving at the ER. However, the extent of damage to his vital organs was immediately apparent to all who saw him.
### Deteriorating Fast
Still in shock from witnessing the scene, Jim recalled the patient was awake and terrified, repeatedly asking the medical staff if he would survive. With no cellphones available yet, responders were contacting his mother to come, but she was not home. His condition was rapidly worsening as he grew pale and complained of feeling cold. Two surgeons assessed that his intestines and bladder were too damaged to survive even with immediate surgery, given the hospital's limited resources at the time. They could only wait with the dying man for the inevitable.  
### A Kind Soul's Trauma
Jim was visibly shaken while recounting the ordeal. As a generally optimistic **respiratory therapist**, seeing someone his own age in such a dire situation was understandably traumatic. The young victim had pleaded that he couldn't believe he was hit by a car, genuinely hoping for reassurance that he would be okay. But everyone knew the grim reality and had to watch helplessly as life gradually faded. Jim couldn't bear to remain at the bedside any longer and had to step away.
### Confronting Mortality 
In another case, a motorcycle accident required my response to a remote cliffside location. I found the rider badly injured at the bottom, and immediately recognized internal bleeding would cause his imminent death. While holding him comfortingly, he confided that the crash was intentional to end his life due to deep depression over a recent breakup. With his last breaths, he asked that I relay a message of love to his grieving mother. It was tremendously difficult to then deliver the doubly tragic news. In those final moments, he accepted the truth and used what little time remained to express compassion.
### Doing What's Needed
A semi truck versus pickup collision I attended was no less harrowing. The driver was pinned yet conscious on scene. Upon starting extrication, his crushed torso was plainly incompatible with life. We requested his wife's presence to say goodbye before fatal interventions. Adrenaline allows focus amid chaos, but the heaviness sets in afterwards. As first responders, we're compelled to acknowledge hard realities and maximize comfort, even if reality must pierce hope. It's never easy, yet conveying realism with empathy aids acceptance during suffering's darkest hour.
### Coping With trauma 
The mental toll of responding to graphic fatal incidents was immense. Witnessing disfigured bodies and consoling grieving family members left deep scars. Our department wisely offered counseling after each critical call to process trauma in a healthy way. Over time, we found solace by reflecting on all the lives saved through our efforts too. While no amount of experience can fully armor the soul against death's brutality, remembering more positive outcomes provided perspective and purpose and prevented burnout. Community support was also vital for coping as first responders.
### Facing Harsh Truths With Compassion
For those thrust into death's presence, whether victims or responders, confronting mortality produces uniquely profound burdens. Yet with dignity and care, even the most graphic realities can be borne. For the dying, honest reassurance allows facing truths while retaining hope. And for responders, centering empathy over detachment sustains humanity through horror. While no role destroys death's power, we can approach its darkness with light by valuing each moment of connection. In tragedy's shadow, kindness remains a beacon for the soul.
