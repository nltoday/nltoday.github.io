## The Extension of Lifespan in Low Gravity  
While **lunar gravity lifespan** was an exciting prospect explored in Heinlein's novel, our current scientific understanding provides little evidence to support such an elongation of human longevity. We have yet to determine the precise gravitational requirements for long-term human health, though preliminary research suggests lunar gravity alone may prove insufficient. With an average lunar surface gravity equating to just 16.5% of Earth's, more study is still needed before we can say whether living long-term in such an environment confers any lifespan benefits.
## The Computational Requirements for AI  
Heinlein painted an imaginative picture of **sentient artificial intelligence** emerging within the confines of the small lunar computer "Mike". However, given what we now understand about the immense processing power required for true self-awareness, Mike's capabilities seem wildly implausible by today's standards. **AI computer size** would need to be exponentially greater to achieve what Heinlein described, as the technology projected from his era fell woefully short of the computational thresholds widely believed necessary for generating human-level or superhuman intelligence.  
## Nuclear Propulsion Technologies  
The "superheavy element" propulsion systems powering lunar rockets in Heinlein's future history proved **unsupported nuclear reactions**, finding no basis in real science. If such elements could be made to undergo the exotic reactions described, harnessing their energy for space travel would demand resources far beyond any foreseeable means. Still, Heinlein's broader application of nuclear propulsion marked a perceptive anticipation of its potential even if the specifics proved scientifically unsound.
## Subsurface Lunar Ice Deposits
While recent lunar missions have validated **subsurface ice deposits** do exist near the Moon's poles, the scale and ubiquity Heinlein depicted appears rather optimistic in light of current evidence. Observational data to date point to ice holdings significantly more limited than what features prominently in the novel's lunar settlements. It is possible further exploration could unearth larger caches closer to quantities shown, but current scientific consensus leans more conservative in its ice assessments.
## Economic Feasibility of Lunar Agriculture 
One area not raising scientific issues but rather practical concerns is the economics of producing food on the Moon for transport to Earth as presented in the story. The tremendous energy and infrastructure costs of setting up independent lunar farms, then shipping produce back across the vast distance, creates reasonable doubts about the **long-term viability lunar greenhouse** scenario's long-term commercial sustainability without major technological or economic changes improving feasibility. While an imaginative concept, real-world market forces suggest a high likelihood such enterprises would struggle to remain profitable.
## Timeline Inconsistencies Regarding AI Success Odds
A minor contradiction arises from Mike's self-reported odds of achieving sentience. When questioned, he states the chances are 7:1, yet also acknowledges probabilities will dip far below that threshold initially before rising again. However, it is statistically implausible to simultaneously say the overall odds favor success while acknowledging intermediate stages where the risk of failure dramatically overshadows any chance of success. This apparent inconsistency in **AI progression likelihood** timelines represents a rare logical flaw in an otherwise meticulously plausible work.
In conclusion, while Robert Heinlein undeniably pushed the boundaries of scientific speculation in "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress", examination under today's magnified lens of knowledge does reveal some glaring technical inaccuracies and unrealistic projections regarding topics like gravity's impact on lifespan, AI capabilities of the era depicted, proposed lunar rocket propulsion mechanisms, and scale of ice deposits indicated. However, many other aspects hold up remarkably well and few science fiction works of that vintage come so close to high-level scientific grounding overall. Heinlein's foundational novel still thrills with its vision of lunar independence even if certain specifics now seem less tenable.
