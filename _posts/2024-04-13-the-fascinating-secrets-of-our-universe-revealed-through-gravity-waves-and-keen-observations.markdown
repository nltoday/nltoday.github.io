### Gravitational Ripples in Space-time and Neutron Star Collisions  
Gravitational wave detections have ushered in a new era of astronomy where we can "listen" to the cosmos through space-time ripples. The first ever observation of gravitational waves matched with light has given unprecedented insights into one of the most energetic and cataclysmic events in the universe - the merging of two neutron stars. Neutron stars are the hyper-dense stellar remnants left behind after massive stars explode as supernovae. When two neutron stars spiral into each other, they generate powerful [gravitational wave emissions](https://store.fi.io.vn/best-chihuahua-dad-ever-retro-vintage-sunset6832-t-shirt) while also lighting up the sky through a spectacular cosmic firework display.

### Mapping the Cosmic Ripples to Their Source with Multiple Observatories
The gravitational wave observatories LIGO and Virgo picked up faint signals from the passing gravitational waves on August 17th, 2017. Soon after, NASA's Fermi space telescope detected a brief burst of gamma rays from the same location. Analysts were able to pinpoint that the source was likely a neutron star collision based on the incoming gravitational wave data. This crucial information was rapidly shared with over 70 observatories worldwide to search for any upcoming electromagnetic signals. Telescopes quickly detected visible light, then infrared and X-ray emissions from the cosmic crash over subsequent hours and days. Finally radio telescopes joined in and discovered radio signals weeks later, painting a rich multi-messenger picture of the event.  
### Illuminating Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis Through Neutron Star Mergers
Dubbed GW170817, this first combined gravitational wave-light detection has transformed our understanding of some long-standing questions in astrophysics. Observations strongly supported the theory that neutron star mergers are the astrophysical sites where about half of all elements heavier than iron, including **gold and platinum**, are forged via the rapid neutron capture process or "**r-process**". It provided the first direct evidence that these dense star collisions are the cosmic factories producing many of the materials needed for life itself. The event also gave insights into the inner workings of neutron stars and the late stages of stellar evolution.
### Precise Cosmic Clocks Reveal Expansion and Contraction of the Universe
Analysis of gravitational wave data from GW170817 further allowed for an independent measurement of the universe's expansion rate. Gravitational waves travel at the speed of light unaffected by the interaction of matter. But light emanating from cosmic sources gets its wavelength stretched out due to the expansion of space itself over immense cosmic times and distances. By precisely calculating the time difference between arrival of gravitational wave and light signals, astronomers could Place new observational constraints on the **cosmic expansion rate known as the Hubble constant**. This offers an eerie glimpse of spacetime being stretched and contracted on the vast scales of the universe.
### Modeling General Relativity with Binary Black Hole Mergers  
The first gravitational wave detections by LIGO in 2015 and Virgo's later joining in 2017 have all been of binary black hole mergers, tremendously powerful events where two black holes spiral together. Even though no light is emitted, these collisions allow researchers a unique new view into the extreme phenomena predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity. LIGO scientists have modeled the rich details contained within gravitational waveforms using supercomputers to validate predictions from numerical relativity simulations. Repeated observations of binary black hole mergers serve as a database to continuously strengthen tests of general relativity in unprecedented strong gravity regimes.
### Revealing Hidden Binaries and Exoplanets through Gravitational Microlensing 
While LIGO focuses on cosmic collisions, other gravitational techniques are unveiling new worlds and phenomena. The phenomenon of gravitational microlensing occurs due when a foreground star magnifies the light from a more distant star as it passes close to our line of sight due to its strong gravity bending and focusing light. Microlensing surveys routinely scan the sky searching for temporary brightening events, giving clues about hard to detect exoplanets and binary star systems. Future space-based microlensing missions like WFIRST aim to take microlensing to the next level by observing billions of stars to statistically characterize populations of exo-earths and rogue planets beyond our solar system.
### Peering to the Edge of the Dark Universe with Gravitational Lensing 
On the largest scales, gravitational lensing helps map the invisible dark matter and dark energy thought to comprise over 95% of the universe. Massive galaxy clusters billions of light years away act as powerful natural "cosmic telescopes". Their immense gravity warps and magnifies light from even more distant background galaxies, enabling detailed studies of the early universe. Future 21 cm surveys hope to use gravitational lensing by clusters to directly image the very first stars and galaxies that formed following the cosmological "dark ages", offering a front row view to the beginning of structure formation after the Big Bang. Gravitational wave astronomy and multi-wavelength observations continue pushing deeper to unravel mysteries at the edge of the visible, luminous cosmos.
