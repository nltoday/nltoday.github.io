### A Well- deserved Break Back Home
It was Umer's first break since joining the Army. He was granted leave to attend his cousin's wedding back in Kashmir. The 22-year-old officer arrived in Shopian district to celebrate with his family. Little did they know, it would be the last time they saw their beloved son alive. On the night of May 9th, at around 8pm, armed terrorists entered Umer's house in Harmein village. They forcibly took the unarmed officer away, warning his family against alerting the police.
### A Cowardly Abduction and Murder 
The following morning, Umer's bullet-ridden body was found 3km from his home. He had been brutally shot at close range, with bullets hitting his head and chest. Authorities believe Umer fought courageously against his abductors. The **cold-blooded killing** of an unarmed soldier on leave sparked outrage across Kashmir. Locals demanding the terrorists be brought to justice. Major General B.S. Raju, directing counter-terrorism in South Kashmir, ordered a massive manhunt to identify the killers.
### Farewell to a Fallen Hero
Umer's funeral was attended by a huge crowd paying their respects. With full military honors, his coffin was wrapped in the Indian tricolor and a gun salute given.

Though just 22, he had embodied the **spirit of patriotism and sacrifice** that represents the best of the Indian armed forces. 
### An Attack on Unity and Peace
Terrorists believed killing Umer would undermine relations between the army and locals. However, their despicable actions had the opposite effect, strengthening community resolve against violence.
