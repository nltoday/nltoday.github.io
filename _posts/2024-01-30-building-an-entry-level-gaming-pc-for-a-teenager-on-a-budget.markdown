### Choosing the Right Components 
For an entry-level gaming PC on a tight budget, a used [GTX 1050 graphics card](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-doberman-pinscher-dog-pup-sleeping-v-neck-t-shirt/men&) would be a much better value than a new GTx 1030. The 1050 is capable of running modern games at low to medium settings, while the 1030 is really only suitable for basic office and web work. I would recommend searching used markets for a 1050, being wary of potential scams from sketchy sellers. 
Another way to save some money would be opting for an **Intel Core i3 processor** instead of the suggested i5. While the i5 has a few advantages like additional cores and threads, games are generally not optimized to fully utilize those resources yet. An i3 will still provide smooth performance for most esports and casual titles without breaking the bank. Leaving some headroom for future upgrades is important too.

### Building the Foundation
When choosing parts, focus first on a solid motherboard and quality power supply. A budget B460 motherboard from MSI, Asus or Gigabyte would work well paired with the i3 CPU. Look for at least two RAM slots and support for the latest PCIe standards. A 500-600W 80+ Bronze rated power supply from a reputable brand like Corsair, Seasonic or EVGA ensures long-term reliability. 
Storage is flexible - a 256GB NVMe SSD provides very fast load times for games and Windows. Adding a 1-2TB hard drive later allows cost-effective mass storage. For cases, basic mATX towers from Cooler Master, Phanteks or Fractal Design around $50-70 offer good airflow and features.
### Assembly and Setup
Assemble the system following your motherboard manual for component placements and connections. Apply thermal paste gently when installing the CPU cooler, then plug in front panel connectors carefully. Install Windows 10 onto the SSD for a smooth experience. Download drivers directly from manufacturer websites. 
Test hardware thoroughly to check for issues before closing the case. An **anti-virus program** like Windows Defender provides basic protection during use. Consider extra case fans for optimal **thermal management** in hot climates or workloads.
### Enjoying Your New PC  
Popular PC game launchers like Steam, GOG and Epic Games offer huge libraries of titles for all budgets. Free-to-play esports and **multiplayer games** are perfect for beginners. Single-player indies and classic games from a few years ago still look great with entry-level hardware. Browsing builds confidence for tackling more demanding games down the line.
Most importantly, have fun and be sure to share the hobby with that lucky teenager! Building their first gaming rig together fosters creativity and skills for the future.
### Expanding Potential Through Upgrades
In a year or two, used components again provide affordable ways to **expand performance**. Upgrading the GPU should remain the top priority as games become more demanding. Swapping the i3 for a six-core i5 or i7 further boosts longevity. Additional RAM, faster SSDs, bigger monitors - these incremental changes keep the system feeling fresh for several years. 
Proper cooling, power supply capacity and an upgradable platform make this a great foundation for supported exploration and discovery. Nurturing interests sets any young person up for success, so kudos for empowering a budding PC enthusiast!
