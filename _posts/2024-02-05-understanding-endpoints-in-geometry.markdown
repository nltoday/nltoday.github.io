### Defining Endpoint
An [endpoint](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/albee) implies two points that bound a segment of a straight line, comprising of one starting point and one ending point. To better comprehend endpoints, let's examine some geometric shapes. 
A straight line has no endpoints, as the line extends infinitely in both directions. A ray also has one endpoint - its starting point at the source, but no ending point as it extends indefinitely in one direction.

### Circles Have No Endpoints
A **circle** is a curve formed by all points equidistant from a fixed point known as the **center**. Any straight line intersecting the circle forms an arc. Therefore, by this interpretation, we can say every point on a circle is equivalent to an arc of a line forming the circle. Thus, a circle has no distinct endpoints but contains an infinite number of points.
### Polygons Define Endpoints  
Polygons are plane shapes formed by three or more line segments connected end-to-end. The number of sides of a polygon is therefore equal to the number of line segments, and since each segment has two endpoint points, the total number of endpoints is twice the number of sides.
For example, a **triangle** contains three line segments and so has six endpoint points comprising its three vertices. Likewise, a **square** has four sides and so has eight endpoint points, with two points at each of its four corners. This pattern holds for all polygons - their number of endpoints is always twice the number of sides.
### Modeling Hyperbolic Geometry  
To model hyperbolic geometry, which does not obey the parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry, the **Poincare disk model** is often used. In this model, hyperbolic lines are represented as arcs of circles inside the disk that meet the bounding circle at right angles. 
Distances become distorted such that moving toward the edge of the disk causes trajectories to curve more than expected. Thus geodesics, or "straight lines", appear curved. Though seemingly complex, this illustrates hyperbolic geometry can be understood through transformed models of familiar Euclidean space.
### Constructing Hyperbolic Shapes  
In the Poincare disk, a hyperbolic triangle has curved sides but interesting properties can be seen. If three non-colinear pointsinside the disk not lying on a common geodesic are chosen, there need not exist a hyperbolic circle passing through them all. 
By drawing the unique Euclidean circle through these points, it may intersect the disk boundary, showing no corresponding hyperbolic curve can be formed. This demonstrates that in hyperbolic geometry, three points do not necessarily determine a unique enclosing shape, unlike in Euclidean contexts.
### Transforming Geometric Models
Linear fractional transformations allow isometries between geometric models to be understood. These are functions of the form $f(z) = \frac{az + b}{cz + d}$ that map the extended complex plane bijectively. Circles remain circles and angles are preserved under such mappings.
Therefore, fractional linear transforms provide a tool to move between models while maintaining their geometrical relationships. For instance, the Poincare disk can be linearly transformed to map any three given points to convenient locations, simplifying proofs about their enclosing shapes.
### Relation to Other Models
Besides the Poincare disk, other models exist for visualizing hyperbolic geometry. The **Poincare half-plane** represents hyperbolic space as the upper half-plane equipped with a Riemannian metric. Isometries are again given by fractional linear transformations. 
The **hyperboloid model** embeds hyperbolic geometry in a quadric surface in Minkowski spacetime. Here, geodesics appear as intersection circles with the hyperboloid. Each model offers insights and provides alternative lenses for studying non-Euclidean geometries.
Through examining geometric concepts like endpoints across models, fundamental properties and differences compared to familiar Euclidean settings become clearer. The ability to transform between representations further aids relating, proving, and building intuition about hyperbolic and other non-trivial geometries.
