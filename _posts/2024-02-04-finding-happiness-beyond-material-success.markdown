### Routine vs Joy
We get so lost in the daily routines of life that we forget to listen to our heart and what truly excites us. As priorities shift to career, family and social expectations during our 30s, it's easy to neglect our own needs and happiness. While a good salary and properties signal success, they don't necessarily equate to joy. More money doesn't always buy more happiness as experiences are what we cherish.

While team sports pressure winning over fun, individual activities like badminton stress gameplay over results. Give and receive through community to combat isolation - holding doors open uplifts others as it does ourselves.
### Mindfulness and Daily Rituals

Success chasers risk missing life's sweetest moments. The author found fulfillment giving up unnecessary possessions and bosses draining his energy. Learn to appreciate simple roadside **courtesies** without judgment. Live authentically according to your values rather than others' opinions. True achievement arises from **following our passion** regardless of external validation.

Change perspective through daily reflections - record three great things and ponder their significance. By focusing on positivity and cultivating inner joy daily, we access wells of strength during harder times. Happiness originates from within, find it by living wholeheartedly.
