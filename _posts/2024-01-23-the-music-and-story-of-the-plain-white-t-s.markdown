# The Rise of an Iconic Pop Rock Band
When you think of romantic pop rock ballads, there's a high chance the Plain White T's hit song "Hey There Delilah" comes to mind. Beyond just that one major hit, the Plain White T's have had an interesting journey spanning over two decades in the music industry. Let's explore the history and story behind this beloved American rock band.
### # Humble Beginnings in Chicago 
The Plain White T's first started out in Lombard, Illinois back in 1997 as a trio consisting of friends Tom Higgenson, Ken Fletcher, and Dave Tirio. They played mostly local punk shows around Chicago suburbs wearing **plain white t-shirts**. As they began establishing themselves on the local scene, guitarist Steve Mast joined to complete the early lineup. Despite facing hardships like Higgenson's car accident that forced him to relearn how to walk, the band remained determined to take their music more seriously.
