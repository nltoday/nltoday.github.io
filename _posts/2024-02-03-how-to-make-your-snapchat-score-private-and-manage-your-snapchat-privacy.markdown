Snapchat has become increasingly popular as a social media platform where users can share fun moments with friends through pictures and videos. However, many users are concerned about maintaining their privacy on the app. One of the key aspects of a Snapchat profile that some wish to keep private is their Snapchat score. Understanding how Snapchat privacy settings work and how to make adjustments can help users take control of what they share and with whom. 
### Snapchat Score Visibility 
By default, your Snapchat score is visible to all friends on your friends list. Your score appears right below your username on your profile. Your score increases whenever you send a Snap to a friend. Many casual Snapchat users are comfortable with their friends seeing their activity levels, but some prefer more privacy. [Snapchat privacy settings](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-forever-poodle-1) offer limited customization over who can see details like your location, story posts, and contact options. Unfortunately, there is currently no setting to selectively hide your score from individual friends. The only way to prevent someone from seeing your score is to remove or block them as a friend.

### Removing Friends for More Privacy
If you want to hide your Snapchat score from specific people, you'll need to remove them as a friend or completely block them. To remove a friend, open their chat, click the three dots in the top right, and select "Remove Friend." They will no longer have access to view your profile or score. Blocking a user goes a step further by preventing them from finding or contacting you on Snapchat at all. However, removing friends limits your ability to communicate with them through Snap unless they add you back. Consider this option carefully based on your relationship and comfort level with that person seeing your activity. 
### Adjusting Other Privacy Settings 
While Snapchat score visibility cannot be customized, you do have control over other important privacy settings. Under "Who Can..." in your settings, configure who is able to view your story, see your location, contact you directly, and find you in Quick Add. For example, you may choose to keep your story posts visible to only friends for greater control over what content is public versus private. Be aware that modifying any privacy controls could impact how others interact with you on the app and your ability to view certain content from others with more restricted profiles. Take time to understand each setting to select options that provide your preferred level of sharing versus security.
### Inactive Accounts and Fake Scores 
If you notice a friend's Snapchat score hasn't changed in a while, it likely means they've become inactive on the app or stopped using it regularly. An unchanged score simply means they are not actively sending Snaps. Some users try artificial methods to boost a low score through repeated Snaps between their own multiple accounts or to celebrities, who likely will not respond. However, Snapchat is intended as a way to genuinely share moments with close connections—focus more on quality over meaningless numbers. An honest low score is nothing to be self-conscious about. Friends value real engagement over inflated stats.
### Setting Expectations and Communicating Needs 
For the healthiest social media experiences, have open discussions with close friends about digital privacy expectations. Some may not understand why you feel the need for a private score and could take it personally. Explain your reasoning calmly based on personal preferences rather than accusing them of wrongdoing by viewing publicly available information. Ask what level of sharing they are comfortable with reciprocally. Compromise to find a balanced approach, such as hiding scores except for a small trusted circle. Setting healthy relationship boundaries through respectful communication helps avoid privacy concerns from causing tension or distrust between friends online and off.
### Alternative Ways To Monitor Activity 
If monitoring friends' Snapchat activity levels feels important, try focusing less on scores and more on the quality of interactions. Do they still engage with your story posts and chat periodically? Small signs of regular contact can convey someone’s interest more than numbers alone. You can also check when friends were “last active” without seeing scores if maintaining an accurate tally is the primary goal. Remember that Snapchat, like most social platforms, aims to facilitate real human connection—if relationships with people feel balanced and caring, there is no need for obsessive metric tracking to confirm their investment. Numbers are meaningful only to a point.
In conclusion, managing privacy online requires understanding available tools and having respectful communication with connections. For Snapchat, the focus should be on using privacy settings that promote comfort sharing personal moments, while remembering scores are just abstract indicators of use - not measures of friendship worth. With compromise and trust between individuals, social networks can uphold both privacy and relationships in a healthy balanced way. Making adjustments and setting clear expectations with close friends ensures Snapchat, or any platform, supports quality time with people that matter most.
