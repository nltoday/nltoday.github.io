## The King's Doubt
King Shrenika had recently embraced Jainism but he was plagued by doubts regarding the stories from the popular version of Ramayana that were taught in schools. He found some details like monkeys building bridges and Ravana not waking up despite various tortures to be illogical and irrational. To clear his doubts, he sought guidance from the learned Jain monk Gautama. 
## The Facts About Hanuman and Others
Gautama assured the king that his doubts were valid and proceeded to narrate the actual events as documented in Jain scriptures. He clarified that **Hanuman and other Vanars were not actually monkeys but belonged to the noble "Vanar Vansh" lineage. Hanuman was one of the most handsome and virtuous men who married many princesses.** Contrary to popular belief, **Hanuman did not put Lanka on fire but only admonished Ravana after breaking free from his bonds in the king's palace.**
### Ravana Was a Noble King
Gautama presented **Ravana as a great and noble king who unfortunately had the flaw of lust.** Ravana's abduction of Sita was seen as a tragic event rather than an act of a demon. Ravana was not actually a rakshasa but belonged to the noble rakshasa lineage.

## The Actual Course of Events 
Gautama then narrated the actual course of events as documented in the Jain scriptures:
### Ram Didn't Kill Ravana 
Contrary to popular belief, [it was Lakshman and not Ram who killed Ravana in the battle](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/ahmadi). When Ravana attacked Lakshman with his weapon, it stopped in mid-air and went into Lakshman's hand. Lakshman then killed Ravana with his own weapon.
### Ram Attained Enlightenment
**Ram is depicted as the ideal Jain hero who conquered his passions and attained enlightenment in his last birth.** At the end of his life, Ram renounced the world and became a Jain monk.
### Fate of Others 
**Lakshman and Ravana went to hell for their karma while Sita went to heaven and became Ravana's leading disciple.** 
## Ramayana in Context of Jain Time Cycle
Gautama explained that these events occurred during the time of the 20th Tirthankar as per the Jain concepts. **Ram was the 8th Baldev, Lakshman the 8th Vasudev and Ravana the 8th Prativasudev - the 63 great souls born in the 4th era of the descending time cycle.**
## Doubts Cleared About Ram and Sita 
This resolved King Shrenika's doubts about Ram and Sita. **Ram was not a god but an enlightened soul. Sita faced difficulties due to her attachments but became detached in the end.**
## Conclusion
The king was thankful to Gautama for clearing his misunderstandings and presenting the rational version of events from Jain scriptures. **He realised that fantastical details obscure the true message of overcoming attachments and desire for worldly pleasures through the example of noble souls like Ram.**
### The Jain Ramayana Emphasizes Detachment
**The Jain Ramayana highlights detachment as the ultimate lesson and goal.** All the characters move from attachment to liberation as their karmas play out. **Overcoming delusions and cravings through self-effort is the path shown.**
