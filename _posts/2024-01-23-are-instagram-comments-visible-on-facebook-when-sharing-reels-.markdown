## How Reels Sharing Works Between Instagram and Facebook
When someone shares content from Instagram to Facebook, it functions more like cross-posting rather than deep integration between the two platforms. While reels can be shared from Instagram to Facebook, the user interactions on the original Instagram post such as comments and likes will not transfer over. Let's explore how reel sharing and comment visibility works between these social media platforms.
### Reels Become New Posts on Facebook
When a user decides to share their Instagram reel on Facebook, the reel video itself gets exported and posted as a new, separate piece of content on their Facebook profile or page. [This shared reel acts as its own unique post](https://store.fi.io.vn/funny-chihuahuas-halloween-costume-witch-chihuahua-dog-lover-312-chihuahua-dog), independent of the original on Instagram, so none of the existing comments or likes are copied over. Instead, Facebook users can interact with the video by commenting, reacting, sharing etc on the shared post itself.

### Privacy of Original Instagram Comments 
The comments other users have left on the original Instagram reel will remain private to that platform only. **Even if the reel is publicy shared on Facebook, those Instagram comments will still be invisible.** The only exception would be if the user who posted the reel has their Instagram account linked to Facebook and has enabled automatic cross-posting of all their comments between the two networks.
### Visibility Depends on Several Factors
Whether someone can see your comments that were left on an Instagram reel that was shared to Facebook really comes down to a combination of variables:
- The privacy settings of your Instagram account and the original reel post
- How the reel was shared - directly from Instagram or via someone else's Facebook post 
- Any cross-posting settings if your accounts are linked
- The sharing settings selected by whoever shared the reel on Facebook
## Best Practices for Comment Visibility 
With the complexities of how Instagram and Facebook handle reel sharing and comment visibility between platforms, it's important to be mindful of some best practices.
### Assume Wider Audience than Just Instagram Followers
Unless you have confirmed privacy settings, assume that any public comments you leave could potentially be viewed by a wider audience than just your Instagram followers - especially if the content is shared elsewhere.
### Adjust Instagram Privacy Settings As Needed  
Take the time to customize your account privacy settings on Instagram, such as choosing who can follow you, view your stories, see your posts and comments. This gives you more control over visibility.
### Be Cautious with Linked Accounts
If you have linked your Instagram and Facebook accounts, double check any automatic cross-posting settings which could extend the reach of your comments beyond one platform. Consider unlinking accounts if desired.
### Ask Creator of Shared Reels for Details  
For reels others share publicly, check with the original poster on their privacy and sharing settings to better understand potential comment visibility before interacting on the post. Communication is key.
## In Summary
Managing your privacy and understanding how reels are shared between Instagram and Facebook is important for having informed consent over visibility of your comments and interactions. With some best practices in mind, you can feel more confident leaving comments without unintended broader exposure.
