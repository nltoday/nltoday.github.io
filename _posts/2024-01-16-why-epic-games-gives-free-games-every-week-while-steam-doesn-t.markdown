Epic Games Store has been aggressively providing free games to users every week as a long term strategy to acquire and retain more gamers on their platform compared to the larger Steam store. By creating a habitual behavior of users coming to their store weekly and building up their gaming library over time, Epic aims to have their platform become the preferred destination for many gamers. 
### Building A Large Gaming Library
Epic Games Store gives out one or more free games every week. After just a year, a gamer would have collected over 50 titles without spending a penny - much larger than the average Steam user's collection. A substantial library is a strong incentive for users to increasingly use Epic's storefront more over Steam.

The weekly free games encourage habitual checking of the Epic Store. Even if not actively playing, users come back regularly to see the new free offerings. This strengthens brand awareness and platform loyalty over time compared to Steam which lacks similar incentives for repeated visiting.

### Spending Money In The Store  
Beyond the free content, Epic also runs deals and discounts periodically to get users purchasing additional games. Their aggressive $10 or $15 coupons on games priced $15 or more above during major sale periods sharply reduces the costs. This entices shifting spending from Steam to Epic while building the library size advantage mentioned earlier.
**Platform User Retention Longtail Keyword**
Majority of gamers prefer consolidating their entire collections on one platform. Epic strategically makes their store progressively more attractive to own larger portions of users' libraries over time through the techniques discussed to boost retention.
### Competing With Steam's Market Dominance
Steam has been the dominant force for over a decade with massive library sizes, regular major sales and community features. For Epic to succeed in significantly eroding Steam's userbase, they need disruptive tactics like giving out dozens of premium titles completely free rather than just regular discounts. 
**Digital Games Distribution Platform Competition longtail keyword**  
The free weekly games directly address the library size incentive keeping users rooted to Steam. It shifts ownership of popular titles from Steam to the Epic platform for a portion of users very cost effectively compared to normal digital sales.
### Winning Over Loyalty From Existing Steam Users
Most PC gamers have huge Steam libraries after many years and are reluctant to switch ecosystems. Epic aims to gradually prize away a percentage of Steam users to their own store by supplementing their much smaller collections substantially through the free game program. 
**Habitual Customer Behavior In Games Retail longtail keyword**
Once Epic accounts for a notable part of a user's total library, combined with sale deals better than Steam periodically, they could become the preferred newer purchase location while retaining the overall Steam library. This achieves Epic's goal of pulling customer spending and activity towards their own store.
### Impact On Other Storefront Competitors 
While Steam remains the dominant force, other stores like GOG, Origin and Uplay have struggled to gain mainstream market share. Epic's free games strategy poses a serious challenge to these platforms too in the mid-to-long term. Their current limited user bases and collections may find it harder resisting Epic's weekly free title incentives drawing away more customers.
**Multi-Platform Video Game Distribution longtail keyword**   
Epic is aiming for widespread library ownership on their store to become integral to the PC gaming experience. This threatens all competitors by directly increasing the value gap compared to their offerings without such aggressive content giveaways. It will be difficult for others to match Epic's strategy at its scale for a widespread user impact.
### Sustainability Of The Free Games Model
A key question is how sustainable is Epic's strategy of regularly giving away big budget AAA games completely free. Their deep pockets from Fortnite success allow for now, but such heavy promotional spending cannot continue indefinitely. Much depends on how much incoming revenue increases from sales and microtransactions during and after the free content brings users into the store long term. 
**Video Game Industry Business Model Innovation longtail keyword**
If Epic can successfully transition a notable portion of free game claimers into habitual buyers over the long run, their model would prove very disruptive for competitors and hugely profitable for themselves to remain the top PC storefront. But only time will tell how effective the free content pipeline and purchasing conversions become.
### Conclusion
Epic Games sees tremendous potential in acquiring new gamers and retaining existing Steam users through their aggressive free games program. By steadily growing individual library holdings and store visit habits on their platform, they aim to win a huge share of the lucrative PC games retail market from Steam in the long run. Their strategy presents serious challenges for other storefronts too if Epic sustains this scale of free content giveaways and sales. It remains to be seen how sustainable their current business model becomes as user transition rates impact revenues. But Epic is clearly innovating digital distribution in a very customer-centered manner through free games.
