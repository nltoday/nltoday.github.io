## Epiphany to Change
As an international entertainer, I was constantly on the move hosting events across India and abroad. A year ago, I weighed 125 kilos and felt miserable both physically and mentally. At 46 inches waist size, I struggled to find clothes that fit me and worried for my health. The breaking point came during a visit to my in-laws in Chennai when the commode broke under my weight. This incident made me realize I desperately needed to lose weight for my overall well-being.
## Starting Simple with Walking and Running 
Initially, I focused on developing stamina through [gradual exercise progression](https://store.fi.io.vn/women-happy-halloween-shirts-pug-dog-happy-hallothanksmas-1). I started by walking 2 kms daily and slowly increased duration and distance. Within months, I progressed to running 6 kms accompanied by my loyal dog. Running became therapeutic as I lost myself in the rhythmic beats of my shoes hitting the road. This consistency paved the way for me to comfortably run 15 kms daily.
## Power of Whole Foods and Mindful Eating
I knew sustainable weight loss depended on what fueled my body. I consciously avoided "**white foods**" like rice, bread, sugar and processed junk. Greens, fruits and lean proteins from grilled chicken and fish became staples. Meals were planned according to Indian, middle-class and pauper styles to achieve calorie control. Occasional treats were limited to avoid overindulgence. Mindful eating kept cravings at bay and meals energizing. 
### Tracking Progress and Non-Scale Victories 
Weighing myself weekly and progress photoskept me accountable. Non-scale wins like fitting into older clothes reinvigorated my motivation on tough days. Slowly but steadily, inches melted and weight dropped. Family and friends' surprise at my transformation spurred me onwards.

## Maintaining Through Varied Routines  
Once my goal weight was achieved, I incorporated diverse activities like planks, freehand exercises and yoga to maintain tone and flexibility. Run routes were switched to avoid monotony. Social interactions were enjoyed thoughtfully by choosing healthy dining options. Holidays were balanced through extended workouts. Discipline and moderation became second nature.
## Living Life to the Fullest
Today at 80 kilos with a 32-inch waist, I feel stronger and years younger. Activities that seemed impossible are fun challenges. Sights, sounds and even smells that triggered overeating no longer faze me. The confidence to live freely inspires me daily to stay in shape and set new performance benchmarks. My health journey provedsize and numberson the scales don't determine happiness or capabilities. With dedication, anything is achievable!
## Paying it Forward  
Witnessing positive changes inspires replication. In the past year, I've encouraged family, friends and eventotal strangers to adopt simple yet effective lifestyle tweaks. Small disciplines compound over time for huge rewards if remained consistent. My story spreads hope that lasting transformation is very much possible without drastic measures, expensive gear or punishing routines. The gym and fad diets aren't mandatory either - motivation comes from within when we truly love and dedicate to ourselves. It's never too late to begin. Are you ready for an amazing you?
