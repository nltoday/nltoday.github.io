### Prioritize Investing in Yourself Over Frugality
While living below your means through frugal spending is important, focusing too heavily on cost-cutting can limit your opportunities for growth if taken to an extreme. Remember that your time has immense **value** that increases exponentially with your skills and experience. Rather than obsess over saving every penny, redirect some of your efforts towards **wealth-creating activities** like developing marketable talents, starting a side business, improving your career prospects, or networking with influential contacts. Invest strategically in your network, reputation, and long-term earning potential rather than unnecessarily depriving yourself of modest life experiences that create lasting memories. Balance frugality with investments in your human capital to maximize your chances of future success.
### The Compounding Benefits of Self-Investment   
Just like funds grow exponentially over time through the magic of compound interest, so too do the returns on investing your effort and resources in yourself. Every new skill acquired, professional certification earned, leadership role taken on, or business contact made pays dividends for years or even decades into the future. By age 21, the habits you establish around self-improvement will have compounded massively. Make **the number 1 way to invest in your time and yourself** to continuously expand your capabilities, expertise, and value proposition. Have the patience and foresight that your present self-investment will yield tremendous benefits to your future self, far surpassing any short-term gains from extreme penny-pinching or money spent on distractions with no lasting benefit.
### Pay Yourself a High Hourly Rate  
When valuing your time, consider yourself deserving of executive-level pay. The knowledge worker economy has made human capital the most valuable currency. As such, treat your time as extremely **precious** and refuse to sell it for less than top dollar. Make it a habit to mentally tag an hourly rate of $1000+ to every task you consider, and only engage in activities that compensate you accordingly. This mindset shift will force you to prioritize opportunities with the highest leverage and returns, rather than wasting endless hours on low-value busywork. Keep your time fully booked with lucrative work, strategic self-improvement, meaningful relationships, exercise, rest, and anything else that energizes your mind and supports your long-term objectives. Avoid activities that fail to respect the true worth of your limited supply of time on this earth.
### Continually Reinvest in Your Potential  
Now that the principles of self-investment have been established, it is important to keep fueling your growth engine. Just as successful investors reinvest dividends and capital gains, you too must continually pour new resources, whether financial or not, back into expanding your skillset, networks, or endeavors. Some high-impact ways to do this include: enrolling in online or in-person industry courses to stay on the cutting edge; buying educational books/products in your area of passion; pursuing valuable certifications; taking on additional responsibilities or leadership roles at work; starting a side business; or making higher-level professional connections by hosting in-person discussion groups or virtual roundtables on topics you're knowledgeable about. Never stop acquiring new knowledge, launching new experiments, or developing new goals that push you outside of your comfort zone. Constant self-betterment is the surest way to maximize success throughout all stages of your career and life.
### Assess Your Time Investment Quarterly 
To keep yourself accountable and ensure your time is continually allocated to maximizing ROI, formally assess your activities and goals on a quarterly basis. Review how you spent your time across the major domains of work, learning, health/wellness, relationships, rest, and hobbies. Grade each category based on how closely aligned it is with your values and long-term objectives. Be ruthless about cutting activities that fail to meet your standards. Then, block out focus periods to double down on your highest priority areas and set new targets to keep yourself moving forward at a rapid pace. Periodic evaluations hold you responsible to yourself and prevent stagnation. They also provide an opportunity to course-correct as needed based on any changes to your circumstances or ambitions over time. Continuous self-improvement demands diligent tracking and refinement of your approach on an ongoing basis.  
In conclusion, your most important investment as a young person is in nurturing your potential through lifelong learning, development of marketable skills, and allocation of time to high-impact opportunities. Self-invest regularly through formal education, self-study, career progression, and relationship-building to maximize your earning power, networks and options over the long run. Compounding returns on human capital make this investment far more valuable than any material savings you accrue. Adopt an owner mentality towards constantly expanding your capabilities and treat your time as the priceless asset it is to live a highly optimized, impactful life.
### Focus on Wealth Creation over Penny-Pinching
While saving diligently is important, extreme frugality as a young person risks limiting your growth through deprivation of worthwhile experiences and opportunities. Redirect some savings towards activities that directly contribute to increasing your income potential long-term instead, such as skills training, continuing education, entrepreneurship, career development, or valuable professional networking. Wealth creation through **strategic human capital investments** will yield far greater long-run returns than savings alone. Balance optimal spending with prudent savings habits to maximize your future success rather than unnecessarily restricting your options through extreme penny-pinching at a formative stage of life.
### Learn from Business Leaders' Time Management 
Top executives set a sterling example of treating their limited hours as a precious commodity. Elon Musk notoriously works over 80 hours per week to spearhead multiple major companies transforming industries. He considers each minute an opportunity cost and fills them to the brim with high-impact activities. Jeff Bezos also runs Amazon on just one day off per week to drive the company's vision forward. These titans exemplify valuing your time at a 6-7 figure hourly rate to optimize every waking moment for outsized impact and earnings over the long haul. Taking a page from their book by judiciously guarding your hours from low-value usage is crucial for achieving career success comparable to theirs.
### Measure Self-Investment Returns Annually
To continuously calibrate your development strategy, formally assess returns on your human capital investments annually. Review metrics like new skills/certifications acquired, salary/income increases, responsibility level attained, recognition/awards received, professional network expansion, side business progress, leadership roles assumed and other achievements over the prior 12 months. Grade results versus initial targets and note areas needing adjustment. Set more challenging goals for the coming year based on lessons learned. Keep records to track your multi-year career trajectory upward over time through diligent self-assessments. Steadily maximizing contributions, earnings and advancement demonstrates the powerful compounding occurring through dedication to self-betterment and personal brand building year after year.
### Concluding Remarks
In summary, treating yourself as an investment and constantly reinvesting in your potential can tremendously impact your life trajectory. Balancing sound financial habits with strategic human capital development allows exponential gains in skills, networks, career success and financial freedom over the long run. By adopting the mindset of improving one percent every day, and remaining rigorously accountable through quarterly and annual check-ins, steady self-amplifying progress becomes achievable. Though requiring patience and perseverance, small daily optimizations will snowball significantly by leveraging the mighty forces of compounding returns on improving one's knowledge, abilities and opportunities over time. This approach ensures setting yourself up to live life on your own terms well into the future.
