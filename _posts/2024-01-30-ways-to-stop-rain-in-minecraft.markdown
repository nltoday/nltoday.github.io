### Clearing The Weather With Commands
In the Java Edition of Minecraft, there are a few different options available to clear rainy weather depending on which version you are playing. **For Java Edition 1.13 and newer**, simply enter "/weather clear" into the in-game chat with cheats enabled. This will immediately set the weather to clear for at least 20 game ticks, or one second. To prevent rain for a longer period, you can set a high number after clear like "/weather clear 999999" to keep the weather clear for over a week in-game time. 
**For versions 1.4.2 through 1.12.2**, typing either "/weather clear" or "/toggledownfall" into the chat will work with cheats on. Adding a number after clear allows setting a minimum time for clear weather like the newer versions. **In versions 1.0 through 1.4.2, only "/toggledownfall"** will toggle the rain on or off when cheats are enabled. Using commands is the quickest way to stop rain if you have cheats available.

### Waiting It Out Naturally 
While commands provide an instant solution, **you can also wait for the rain to pass naturally inside the game without cheat codes.** Find shelter under the leaves of trees, inside caves, or under the ceiling of your own house. You can use this downtime to craft useful items like tools, armor, or furniture to improve your shelter. [Another option is to gather resources while it rains](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-boston-terrier-american-flag-usa-patriotic-dog-lover-v-neck-t-shirt/women&) since mobs won't spawn. Grab any nearby wood, stone, food, or loot from chests you find sheltering in.
**Building a fire is also a good way to pass the time** as fires will keep rain and snow from falling in a 3x3 area above the fire block. Craft a fire and use it for warmth, cooking, light, or even crafting at a smithing table. You may find the rain stops on its own after a while. Be sure your shelter is protected from phantoms too if you choose not to sleep.
### Putting Yourself To Sleep 
Another passive way to escape the rain is by **using beds to skip nighttime.** Find sheep to collect wool, craft a bed, and right click it at night. This will set your spawn point and immediately advance to daylight. Be aware you'll need **to protect your bed from monsters** so you can continue using it safely each night. Walling your shelter is recommended.
Phantoms, those flying mobs that only spawn if you don't sleep for three consecutive nights, are another incentive to stay dry indoors by bed usage. After sleeping, you won't have to worry about the rain or phantoms for the next day. Beds restore your energy too, so sleeping is often a good choice for surviving storms.
### Summary
In summary, there are several options in Minecraft for clearing rainy weather depending on your playing conditions and preferences. Using **clear weather commands provides an immediate fix**, natural strategies **allow waiting it out over time**, and **sleeping skips to daylight** as a passive solution. Combining shelter-building, fire usage, command powers or beds allows you to comfortably avoid or escape rainfall for continuing your adventures in the game.
