### The Marksheet Delivery Process
IGNOU typically sends marksheets and other results documents to the address registered by the student. If for some reason the documents do not reach you, there are alternative options to collect them. 
IGNOU no longer issues separate grade cards for each year of study. Instead, students will receive an original grade card and provisional degree certificate after successfully completing their full programme. This new process streamlines document issuance.
For semester or annual results, IGNOU mails the marksheets to the registered address. [Batchmates](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/abril) can be a useful resource if yours does not arrive - you may collect it from your regional centre if others in your cohort have received theirs. This was my experience of obtaining missing marksheets.

### Options for Collecting Degree Documents  
There are a few options for collecting your degree certificate and final marks sheet after programme completion:
IGNOU routinely mails these documents to the registered address once all credits are earned. Allow sufficient time for postal delivery before exploring alternatives. Delays do occasionally occur with standard mail service.
A popular option is attending the annual convocation ceremony to receive the degree in person. This celebrates your academic achievement with peers and faculty. An application requiring a nominal fee must be submitted in advance.
For those unable to attend, IGNOU accepts a demand draft payment to post the degree certificate. The low fee of Rs. 200 covers mailing costs. This remains a convenient option for collecting the Certificate through the official process.
Another method is visiting the IGNOU regional centre in Maidan Garhi, New Delhi to collect your documents later on. Valid photo ID such as a voter ID or previous marksheet must be presented. I obtained my degree this way years after graduating. 
### Handling Lost or Damaged Documents  
On rare occasions, original documents may become lost or damaged in transit. Here are the established procedures:
If your semester or annual marksheet does not arrive as expected, first contact your Regional Centre. They can check records and provide a duplicate if necessary. Proof of previous results aids this process. 
Similarly, in the event your degree certificate or final consolidated marksheet never arrives, you may request duplicates from IGNOU headquarters in Delhi. Submitting copies of earlier documents and an affidavit helps to reissue replaced credentials.
There is a nominal fee for duplicates which covers administrative costs. However, IGNOU strives to reasonably accommodate students missing credentials through no fault of their own. The priority is ensuring qualified learners receive verification of their earned qualifications.
### Maintaining Updated Contact Information
To facilitate smooth delivery of important documents, it is crucial for IGNOU students to keep their registered contact details up to date. Life changes like relocating homes require informing the University. 
IGNOU exclusively mails results and Certificates to the address on file. Failing to report an address change could result in documents getting lost in transit to old locations. Regularly verifying contact information helps ensure important records reach students as intended.
In summary, while IGNOU's standard process effectively delivers marksheets and degrees to most, alternative collection options and duplicate request procedures exist to aid those requiring assistance. With proactive address updates, learners can confidently expect to receive credentials verifying their academic accomplishments.
