### Is Teething Really Linked to Fevers?
Teething is an inevitable process that most babies experience around 6 months of age. While it is developmental milestone, it often comes with discomforting symptoms for little ones. One of the most debated symptoms is fever. Many parents claim their babies develop fevers when teething, yet some medical sources state there is no established link. 
In reality, both sides could be right. Teething itself may not directly cause a fever, but the stress it puts on a baby's body could weaken their immune system and make them more susceptible to other illnesses that do cause fever. Babies are also constantly exploring their environment at this stage and encountering new germs. The timing of a fever could coincide with teething by chance rather than being directly caused by it. More research is still needed to get a definitive medical consensus.
