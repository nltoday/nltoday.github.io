### How to Activate International Roaming 
Many mobile operators in India provide free incoming SMS even when you are roaming abroad. However, to receive SMS while roaming, your SIM needs to have international roaming activated. International roaming is automatically enabled on prepaid SIMs but needs to be activated separately for postpaid SIMs. To activate international roaming on your Airtel postpaid SIM, you can call Airtel customer care and request them to enable this service. Some operators may charge a monthly rental fee to use international roaming but incoming SMS are usually free of cost. It's advisable to check with your operator regarding any charges applicable for using international roaming on your postpaid SIM.

### Receiving SMS Without Activating Roaming 
Interestingly, the original poster mentioned still receiving SMS even without activating international roaming on their Airtel postpaid SIM while travelling to Singapore. This seems counter-intuitive but could be possible due to [roaming agreements](https://store.fi.io.vn/dog-breed-schipperke-funny-s-for-dog-lovers348-2) between mobile operators. Mobile networks often have **reciprocal roaming agreements** in place with partner networks in other countries. This allows customers to access voice and data services abroad through the partner network. It's possible that Airtel has such an agreement with Singapore telecom operators which is enabling incoming SMS even without explicit international roaming activation. However, the poster should not rely on this and contact Airtel to properly enable international roaming for seamless connectivity while travelling abroad.
### Converting Postpaid to Prepaid 
Another suggestion provided was to convert one's postpaid connection to prepaid before travelling abroad. As mentioned earlier, international roaming is enabled by default on prepaid SIMs. So converting to prepaid ensures receiving SMS while roaming without needing to activate anything separately. However, the original poster pointed out some limitations with this approach. Mobile operators in India currently do not allow converting postpaid numbers to prepaid from outside the country. One needs to be physically present in India to process this change. So for travellers already abroad, this option does not work practically.
### Receiving OTP SMS While Travelling 
The primary goal mentioned was to receive **one-time-password (OTP) SMS** for online transactions while travelling abroad. OTP SMS are typically very small in size and do not consume much mobile data. This increases the likelihood of them getting delivered over roaming networks without a valid roaming plan in place. However, it is still safer to properly enable international roaming rather than rely on technicalities or agreements between networks. With roaming activated, one can be assured of receiving all important SMS like OTPs seamlessly throughout their international trip.
