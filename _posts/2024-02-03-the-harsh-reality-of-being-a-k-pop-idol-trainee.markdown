### Starving and Exhausting Trainee Life 
Trainee life is incredibly demanding both physically and mentally. Trainees are expected to follow grueling schedules with little rest or food. Many idols, like Jenny from Blackpink, have spoken about how they would only get a single piece of fruit for breakfast and protein shakes for dinner. Additionally, they would stay up practicing until the early hours of the morning after 12 hour training sessions. The goal is to keep trainees constantly hungry and exhausted to force their bodies into [extreme dieting and weight loss](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-doberman-dog-face-pup-pet-puppy-lover-best-dad-mom-ever-v-neck-t-shirt/women&) so they fit Korean beauty standards. Many are told to lose significant amounts of weight within just one month through severe calorie restriction and intense exercise.

### Relentless Competition Among Fellow Trainees
With only a small number of spots available in each group, the competition among trainees is relentless. To stand out, trainees have to push themselves to constant perfection and outperform their peers. Any perceived weaknesses or lack of effort are seized upon by instructors and could lead to dismissal. Trainees are scrutinized on their dancing, singing, rapping, visuals, and personality. Those that shine in multiple areas have a better chance of **debuting successfully** while others risk being cut. The pressure to always be at the top adds tremendous stress in an already demanding environment.
### Unrelenting Criticism and Harsh Evaluations
Evaluation is a daily part of trainee life but it comes with constant criticism no matter how well a trainee performs. Instructors point out every minor flaw to push trainees to improve. Even the smallest mistakes are harshly addressed in front of others. This type of critical feedback is mentally draining and can damage self esteem over time if trainees internalize the negativity. Slacking off is not an option as companies look for any sign of weakness to **weed out trainees**. Trainees must develop very thick skin to withstand the unsympathetic tone of evaluations and learn to brush off criticism without getting discouraged. 
### Sacrificing Personal Life and Individuality 
Upon entering the company, trainees essentially give up their personal lives and freedom. Phones are confiscated, curfews are imposed, and dating is banned. Trainees live together in dorms under close supervision with security cameras. Individual personalities are discouraged in favor of a carefully crafted public image. Trainees spend years **molding themselves into the ideal type** the company envisions, changing everything from mannerisms to interests. This loss of autonomy and individuality places tremendous strain on mental health over the long training periods. Homesickness also takes its toll on international students cut off from family abroad. 
### Physical and Psychological Risks  
While larger agencies provide some security, safety is not guaranteed even at reputable companies. Beyond the physical strain, trainees also risk psychological damage from the highly competitive environment and harsh criticisms. Stories of poorer treatment, abuse, and **unsafe working conditions** have emerged from smaller agencies unable to properly care for trainees. The idol image expects perfection but the reality involves significant physical and emotional costs that trainees are not fully prepared to bear. Mental health issues commonly reported include anxiety, depression, eating disorders and more. Those who cannot handle the pressure are simply let go with little regard for well-being.
### Constant Surveillance and Strict Regulations 
Trainees essentially give up all privacy and freedom of choice. Phones are confiscated and curfews enforced to keep trainees isolated. Rigid **dieting and exercise regimes** are imposed that teeter on unhealthy, even requiring weigh-ins. Anything seen as damaging an idol's reputation is banned, from dating to social media use. Security cameras monitor dorms continuously. The level of control and surveillance extends beyond work life into all personal actions and relationships. This loss of autonomy weighs heavily on mental health over years of strict regulations that continue even after debut.
### Narrow Chances of Successful Debut 
Despite immense personal sacrifice and grueling training, debut is far from guaranteed. Even among the select few who make it, longevity is not assured given the highly competitive industry. Companies debut numerous groups each year yet only a small percentage **achieve massive commercial success**. Most struggle to gain substantial fan bases and disband within their 7 year contracts. Those unable to debut after years of training have nothing to show for their lost youth and missed opportunities. Debuting internationally improves odds slightly but is still an immense challenge. Trainees enter with hope but must be prepared for the very real likelihood that all their efforts may never lead to a fulfilling career.
### Building Mental and Physical Resilience
While the harsh realities seem unbearable, resilience is key to surviving the K-pop system. Trainees must cultivate immense mental toughness to withstand criticism, pressure from competition and withstand harsh training regimes. Physical strength and flexibility are equally important as are good health habits to avoid injury. Accepting setbacks gracefully and learning from mistakes is vital given constant scrutiny. Above all, inner confidence, passion, and determination to reach goals provide the willpower to push through inevitable challenges. Those able to emerge stronger after facing adversity have the best chance of debuting and achieving stable careers in the unpredictable industry.
