When we first met in college 
### The Beginning
It was the year 2010 when I first met him. We were both studying engineering - me in mechanical and him in electrical. I was trying to find my place and fit in during my second year when he walked up to me in the workshop. I was covered head to toe in grease while working on a practical assignment. He just started a conversation with me as if we had known each other for years. Even though I rejected his offer to watch a cricket match together, I loved the effort he made to get to know me. This was our first meeting that I clearly remember.

### Becoming Best Friends
After that initial interaction, we just started talking more and more. It didn't take long before we became best friends. For the next two years, we were virtually inseparable but never said those three magical words to each other. We just enjoyed being together without needing to put a label on our relationship. When college was coming to an end, reality was setting in that we would have to face life's challenges on our own. Somehow we became each other's anchor during that transition period.
### Long Distance Struggles 
Once college was over, he moved to Hyderabad for work while I stayed in Pune. This marked the beginning of over five years of a long distance relationship. At first, I wasn't sure we could make it work hearing how most long distance relationships don't last. But against all odds, we survived the challenges of physical separation. During this time, he pursued his dream of joining the army. I couldn't have been prouder to see his journey to becoming an [army officer](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-bernard-dog-christmas-lights-puppy-lover-2).
### Convincing Our Families
As our bond grew stronger over the years apart, we both knew we wanted to spend our lives together. The most difficult task was getting our families on board. With his job postings in remote field areas, it was hard to arrange meetings between our parents. Even after they agreed to our marriage, we struggled to find dates that worked due to the nature of his duties. 
### Finally Tying the Knot
On December 31st, 2017, we finally got married. It has been a beautiful journey as husband and wife ever since. Being an army wife has given me a new perspective on life and helped me mature in many ways. Last December, we celebrated our second wedding anniversary feeling grateful for how far we have come.
### Our Little Princess Arrives 
In 2019, we welcomed the newest addition to our family - our daughter. She has brought us so much joy and made our family complete. Watching him as a loving father makes me fall for him all over again. Now with a little princess of our own, I can't wait to see what adventures the next part of our journey together will hold.
Our relationship has stood the test of time against many challenges. But through it all, our **love and commitment** to each other has only grown stronger. I feel blessed to have found my soulmate all those years ago and walk through life by his side. Our story is just beginning...
