### Improved ergonomics
The AK-12 aimed to improve upon the formidable AK-74 design with [enhanced ergonomics and modularity](https://store.fi.io.vn/coffee-and-chihuahua-gift-idea-funny-dog-lovers4849-t-shirt) while retaining reliability. A new telescopic stock provides adjustment for tactical gear and shooting positions, reducing **muzzle rise** and enabling quicker follow-up shots. The Picatinny rails allow optics, lights and other accessories to be mounted securely without interfering with aiming. A quick-detach barrel makes suppressors and other muzzle devices easy to switch.

### Durability concerns  
However, troops have raised issues with the AK-12's durability compared to the AK-74. Reports indicate the plastic and metal parts used in the AK-12 are of lower quality and prone to **cracking, rusting and warping**. The stock catch, gas piston, and receiver cover have shown vulnerabilities. Where the AK-74 can be broken down and cleaned without tools, the AK-12 requires specialized tools and small parts that can be lost, risking weapons failures in combat.
### Maintenance challenges
The non-removable gas mechanism of the AK-12 presents new maintenance challenges compared to the AK-74. Intense firing worsens this issue, as heat, dirt and residue can become trapped where they cannot be easily flushed. In rainy or muddy conditions, it may become impossible to clear obstructions from the gas system without a workshop. Full disassembly for deep cleaning is also more complex. These maintenance difficulties could undermine battlefield dependability.
### Aftermarket incompatibility  
While key to the platform's customization, the Picatinny rails and tactical stock on the AK-12 are also limitations. Their proprietary dimensions prevent using standard aftermarket replacements common on other rifles. Troops invested in particular gear cannot transfer it to an issued AK-12. With the AK-74 pattern widely supported, this closed AK-12 format disadvantages users accustomed to particular third-party accessories and upgrade options.
### Prioritizing parade over performance?
Some critics argue the AK-12 focused more on visual modernization through rails and adjustable stocks rather than optimizing functional performance. Compared to its legendary predecessor, the AK-12 shows weaknesses in areas like durability, serviceability and modularity that matter most during combat deployment and harsh usage conditions. Its gains may be mostly appreciated in demonstration or ceremonial roles instead of hard frontline service like the proven AK-74.
### Potential but unfinished 
The AK-12 represents Russia striving to evolve its small arms, yet the final product indicates the effort was premature. The prototype AK-400 and early AK-12 variants incorporated more compelling upgrades. In rushed development and production, valuable insights seem to have been lost, resulting in an system that needs further refinement to match the rock-solid AK-74. With modifications, the AK-12 concept shows promise. But for now, its reality has fallen short of expectations on the battlefield.
### Reliability is king
Ultimately, any new service rifle must prove itself versus the time-tested standard it aims to replace. On the frontlines, where lives depend on weapons, reliability is the number one priority over aesthetic improvements or hypothetical benefits. By many accounts from combat veterans, the AK-12 has not clearly bettered the AK-74's legendary dependability forged over decades of grueling use worldwide. Until addressing existing shortcomings, it may remain relegated to auxiliary or ceremonial roles instead of assuming the AK-74's mantle as Russia's frontline infantry arm.
