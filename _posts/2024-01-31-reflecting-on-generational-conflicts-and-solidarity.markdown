## The Complex Journey of a War Baby
John was born in 1944 in the midst of World War II. As a [war baby](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cowboy-howdy-horse-rider-western-cool-v-neck-t-shirt/men&), he grew up in tumultuous times but was always grouped together with **baby boomers** despite being technically from an earlier generation. Due to a string of failed marriages and difficulty maintaining relationships, John found himself aging alone. "In my case, 4 failures at marriage, running off anyone who loved me, and the alienation of my living relatives is the reason I'm aging alone," he reflected. To improve his connections with others, John has been attending weekly therapy sessions with a VA psychologist. Though from a different time, the impacts of his upbringing and decisions still linger.
### Living as a Minority in the 1960s  
When John went to college in the 1960s, he and his long-haired friends were a distinct minority, making up only about 5% of the student population. As **hippies** and **flower children**, they faced hatred, mockery and even violence. "We were a distinct minority at my college. I would say we were 5% at most in the population. We were hated, mocked and one of my friends was beaten up in a southern town simply because he had long hair," John recalled. Witnessing the hundreds of thousands of counterculture enthusiasts united at Woodstock in 1969 was an incredibly euphoric experience, as for the first time John realized there were significantly more people who shared his ideals than he had known.

## Boomer Critiques and Generational Divides
While John now finds himself lumped together with **baby boomers**, he does not entirely identify with that generation either. He is highly critical of many boomers' lack of empathy and hypocrisy. "Because many of them, especially the right wing boomers, are profoundly unempathetic and hypocritical. They don't understand and don't want to understand that living costs have gone way up for young adults entering the market, but claim that we're just not working hard enough," John argues. Additionally, boomers received many benefits like lower tuition costs that they now refuse to support for younger generations. 
### Seeking Solidarity Beyond Generational Lines
However, John believes generational battles alone will not solve societal problems. "Hating boomers is no substitute for opposing the wealthy who have dismantled society for their own benefit," he explains. Both younger generations and many boomers have become victims of an unfair system rigged in favor of the wealthy elite. Many boomers now work far past retirement age and struggle with **medical debt** due to lack of **healthcare reform**. "They deserve solidarity," John says. Overcoming divides and uniting across generations will be key to enacting real change.
## Coming to Terms with One's Past
Through weekly therapy, John is working to better understand himself and improve how he relates to others. Exploring his upbringing during wartime and turbulent youth may help explain past relationship patterns. "I'm working with a VA shrink once a week to try to improve relations with the human race," he shares. While the impacts of his decisions linger, John seems committed to growth. Facing one's actions and shortcomings, as well as having empathy for the complex factors that shaped one, are important steps towards healing. Framing issues in generational terms alone can perpetuate divides, so seeking common ground and solidarity may offer more constructive ways of enacting change.
### A Call for Intergenerational Cooperation
By sharing his story, John highlights how generational labels can oversimplify people's diverse experiences. While critical of certain boomer perspectives and actions, he also recognizes validity in some of their critiques of younger generations. Ultimately, John advocates focusing less on generational battles and more on uniting against the powerful forces disproportionately harming people across age groups. With willingness to understand life experiences different than one's own, as well as find shared interests beyond generational distinctions, people of all backgrounds may cooperate on building a society with greater fairness, justice and care for all. John's journey shows the importance of self-reflection, empathy and solidarity in overcoming societal challenges.
