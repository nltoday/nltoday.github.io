### My Struggles with Low Mood and Depression 
Like many others, I too struggled with feelings of low mood and even mild depression throughout my 30s. No matter how much my salary increased over the years, I was unable to find lasting happiness. It wasn't until I consulted a homeopathic doctor that things started improving for me. With just a single dose of medicine, most of my depression symptoms disappeared. This experience taught me that more money does not necessarily lead to more happiness.

### Learning to Appreciate Life's Simple Pleasures  
Going through this phase helped me learn to appreciate life's little joys. Simple activities like jogging regularly, cooking new dishes, spending time with friends, and traveling (even with kids!) began lifting my mood. I noticed that achievements alone did not make me happy - it was focusing on [experiences](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/alejandre), **relationships**, and **personal growth** that truly fulfilled me. Letting go of unrealistic expectations and unnecessary commitments also reduced stress levels. 
### Prioritizing Self-Care and Wellbeing
During my 30s, I was so focused on career growth and fulfilling other's expectations that my own needs took a backseat. This led to burnout and a disconnect from my true self. Now in my 40s, I make **self-care** and **wellbeing** major priorities. I carve out me-time for hobbies like jogging, try new movies and learning activities. I also ensure proper work-life balance by leaving toxic jobs/bosses. Regular journaling helps me focus on life's positives. Overall, striving for inner happiness over outer achievements has made a big difference.
### The Power of Positive Thinking 
While battling low moods, I found that consciously redirecting thoughts towards gratitude and optimism boosted my mental health. Simple practices like keeping a diary of good things or complimenting strangers had remarkable effects. Even pretending to be happy by forcefully thinking happy thoughts worked wonders due to the placebo effect! Our minds have tremendous power to either lift us up or drag us down. By nurturing a **positive mindset**, one can overcome many psychological barriers and doubts holding them back from true fulfillment. 
### Living Life on My Own Terms
Another important lesson was to tune out unnecessary peer/social pressures and live more authentically. I now follow my heart over academics when it comes to interests like arts, sports or travel. Answering thought experiments about perfect weeks off helps uncover buried passions. Letting go of unrealistic dreams and perfectionism has reduced stress levels too. Overall, learning to gently steer the ship instead of being tossed around by waves has brought more joy and meaning to my days.
### Finding Purpose and Excitement Each Day  
While material comforts are nice, true happiness lies in living purposefully each moment. I ensure to look forward to small daily pleasures like anticipated deliveries, weekend trips with friends etc. Participating in community events gives a sense of contribution. Most importantly, developing new skills through **hobbies like coding** ensures life never gets routine or boring. With age, our interests evolve but the childlike ability to get excited remains invaluable. By kindling curiosity and passion projects, one can stay cheerful and youthful from within.
### Finding Light Even in Dark Times
No life journey is without challenges. During tough phases, focusing on **gratitude** for basic blessings like family, health etc has tremendous power to reframe perspective. Even small acts of kindness towards others through smiles or giving way lifts spirits. Making peace with impermanence and accepting what cannot be changed reduces undue suffering. Overall, striking a balance between darkness and light within, and without, is key to navigating life's valley phases gracefully. With self-compassion and community support, one can always find reasons to be cheerful.
