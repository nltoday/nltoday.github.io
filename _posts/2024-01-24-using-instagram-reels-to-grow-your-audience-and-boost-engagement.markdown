### Creating High-Quality Reels from Scratch
For organic growth, it's important to put in the work of creating engaging Reels content yourself. To start, decide on a clear concept or theme and the message you want to convey. Make sure your content provides value to the audience in an entertaining way. Consider the interests of your target audience and create Reels around popular topics and trends but also your unique flair. 
When recording, use different clips and edit them seamlessly together using the in-app tools. Add relevant stickers, captions, Hashtags and a trending background song to capture people's attention. Take time to learn video editing skills using apps like Inshot to produce polished, watch-worthy Reels. Well-edited Reels keep viewers engaged for the full duration.
### Leveraging Existing Videos
You don't always need to create new content from scratch. If you have old video clips or B-roll footage that still resonate with your audience, consider repurposing them into Reels. Edit the clips together while adding relevant information, stickers or text overlays to keep it fresh. This allows you to reuse existing content assets and expand their reach. Look through your camera roll and social profiles for reusable material before filming new clips.
### Using the Right Hashtags 
Hashtags are essential for discoverability on Instagram. Research topically relevant and highly used hashtags in your niche to include 2-5 popular and newer niche hashtags in your Reels caption. Annotate them at the beginning or end of your caption for better visibility. Regularly check trending hashtags and topics to stay up-to-date. Make sure to include **location and branded Hashtags** when relevant for your specific audience and branding goals. Test different hashtag combinations to see what works best.
### Tips to Improve Authentic Engagement
While boosted views and automated likes serve initial visibility, your goal should be attracting real, engaged followers through quality content over time. Here are some tips:
- Encourage viewers to interact with polls, questions or call-to-actions in your Reels 
- Respond to comments promptly to keep conversations going
- Repurpose top comments as captions for new Reels 
- Share Reels to relevant Facebook Groups and pages for outside exposure
- Go Live frequently to build rapport and a sense of community
