Dedicated isolation creates a pristine and robust hosting environment protective of sensitive customer data and digital assets.
### No CapEx or Opex Hardware Costs
Dedicated hosting transfers both capital expenditure (CapEx) and operational expenditure (Opex) costs away from your organization's books. Rather than having to purchase physical servers, switches, power backups or cooling systems upfront, dedicated solutions cover all infrastructure investments through an affordable monthly fee. 
Similarly, ongoing costs for real estate, maintenance, support staffing, software licenses and repairs are shouldered by hosting providers. This CapEx/Opex savings is a huge benefit for growing businesses that want to focus funds towards innovation rather than IT ownership. Dedicated hosting provides all the advantages of dedicated servers with zero upfront hardware/facility investments and reduced long-term expenses.
