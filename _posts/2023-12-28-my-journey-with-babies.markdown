### Becoming a Mother
It was such an incredible experience becoming a mother for the first time. I clearly remember how anxious and overwhelmed I felt in the beginning with no sleep and a constantly crying newborn. However, my mother gave me some sage advice during that difficult time that really stuck with me. She told me that [the only exercise an infant gets is from crying](https://store.fi.io.vn/funny-xmas-this-is-my-christmas-pajama-heartbeat-video-game-98/women&) and that jumping at every little sound would only spoil the baby and make things harder for myself in the long run. Allowing my baby to cry it out, even just for short periods, really did seem to help him sleep better at night. That very night, he slept through for the first time.

### Learning From Experience  
As the years went on and I had two more sons, I continued to use the techniques my mother had taught me. With each subsequent child, things became a bit easier as I had more experience under my belt. While I never actively **made my babies cry on purpose**, I did learn the value in letting them cry it out when needed and not rushing in instantly every time. Even during the challenging teenage years with my daughter, I encouraged her to fully feel and express her emotions through tears if that's what she needed in the moment. I tried to reassure her that **crying is simply the body's way of releasing toxins and can be therapeutic.**
### An Unexpected Surprise    
Though I had always thought three children was the perfect number for our family, life has a way of surprising us at times. Despite having my tubes tied after my sons were born, I did end up with a rare **non-viable pregnancy** on a few occasions. While it was emotionally difficult to experience **recurrent miscarriages**, it also reawakened that amazing feeling of creating new life that I had treasured so much in those early motherhood years. While my days of officially having more babies were now truly over, it served as a beautiful reminder of the miracle of conception.
### Advice for New Parents
If I could offer any advice to newer parents who may be struggling in the early days and nights, it would be to not be too quick to **rush in at the first sign of crying**. Giving babies the opportunity to **self-soothe through tears** is actually really important for their development and your long term sanity. It's also critical that parents make time to properly care for themselves too with rest, nutritious meals, and stress relief. An exhausted and overwhelmed parent is much less effective than one who is **taking care of their own needs first before caring for a newborn**. Overall, trust your instincts but also accept help and guidance from experienced families whenever possible.
### Learning Patience and Compassion 
As my own kids grew into teenagers themselves, I found there was still so much for me to learn about bringing up children. While it was difficult at times seeing my daughter so distraught over normal social pressures and hormonal changes, I tried to **respond with empathy and understanding rather than irritation**. Although letting emotions fully process through crying had been beneficial for her in the past, non-stop tears were now more about gaining her independence and finding her voice. The key became actively listening with **patience and compassion** instead of quick problem solving. With young adults coming of age in such a complex world, supporting them through tough seasons remains so important.
### Cherishing Each Phase of Life
Now in my 50s gazing back over three decades of raising a family, I feel immense gratitude and wisdom. Though those beginning years of sleepless nights tested me beyond my limits, embracing each challenging phase when it was happening has allowed me to cherish every intricate piece that forms this beautiful journey. From first kicks in the womb to graduation caps flying, every moment is a **priceless gift whether joyous or sorrowful**. Most of all, I appreciate how the continuous cycles of both giving and receiving love within my family sustain me still. While my capacity for birthing babies has long passed, the privilege of motherhood endlessly nurtures my soul in new and rewarding ways each day.
