### Taking Care of My Newborn's Needs
After delivery, my parents hired an experienced nanny to help take care of my newborn son and I for the first few months. At around 10am each morning, she would arrive to provide skilled care. [She would start by massaging the baby with warm oil](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/puppy) to soothe and relax his muscles. After the massage, she would give him a warm bath to keep his skin clean and healthy. Once bathed, **she knew how to swaddle the baby tightly but comfortably without restricting his movement or causing discomfort**. Wrapping him up just right allowed him to fall asleep within minutes, resting peacefully for 3 to 4 hours at a time.

### Learning Effective Swaddling Techniques  
Try as we might, my husband and I struggled to replicate the expert swaddling style of the nanny. Due to fears of potentially hurting the baby by wrapping him too tight, our swaddles were not as secure. As a result, he would wiggle free more quickly and wake up from his naps. Watching the nanny, we saw how skillfully she could wrap a baby for maximum coziness without risk of injury. It took practice, but eventually we learned to swaddle with the same gentle yet grounded touch.
### Adjusting to Different Sleep Patterns
At night, the baby would wake every 2 to 3 hours to feed before falling back asleep. We tried placing him in a cradle and rocking it, but this soothing method did not always work. On many nights, we spent hours walking with and holding the crying baby to help him rest. The disrupted sleep took its toll, leaving my husband and I sleep-deprived with dark circles under tired eyes. Caring for a newborn, especially alone, is physically and mentally draining even with outside help during the day.
### Learning Patience Through the Challenging Phases  
All newborns push their caregivers to the limit, routinely waking at odd hours, resisting sleep, and testing patience. They thrive on disrupting normal routines and sanity until assimilating to their own schedule. There seemed no way to make my daughter consistently **sleep when tired due to daytime play rather than staying awake all night**. No matter what we tried - hot baths, massages, rocking or holding - she controlled her sleep pattern. We could only wait for her to naturally grow out of this "overlord" phase. 
### Transitioning to Independent Sleep Habits
Eventually, my daughter passed the active sleep resistance phase and began sleeping through the night on her own terms. While still a struggle at bedtime, this transition gave me much needed personal time. All parents must remember that **children learn to self-soothe and sleep independently over time** rather than through forced techniques. Enjoy each challenging phase because they do not last long before new milestones emerge. Soon my daughter progressed to the "teenage overlord" phase of sleeping all day!
### Focusing on Patience and Observation 
Rather than frustration, the healthiest approach is patience and observation of an infant's natural sleep cues. With experience, both my husband and learned effective techniques like **warm baths, gentle swaddling and allowing the baby to set the schedule**. We found self-soothing methods like snuggling towels worked better than dependence on motion. Newborns teach resilience if caregivers watch for cues instead of expectations. In the end, all phases pass as babes mature into calm, independent sleepers.
