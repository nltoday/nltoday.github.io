### Getting Your Game Ready
Developing a game to showcase its potential is the first major step in the Steam Greenlight process. Ensuring a playable demo is available allows users to get a feel for the gameplay, graphics, and overall experience that will be delivered upon completion. This gives voters confidence that the vision can be realized. It is also important to create promotional materials like screenshots and a video [game trailer](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-cat-gift-for-men-women-girls-boys-feline-kitten-lovers-v-neck-t-shirt/men&) to generate interest. Capturing the essence of the game in a short clip is key to attracting attention on Greenlight.

### Submitting to Greenlight
Once the demo and assets are prepared, developers can pay the $100 submission fee to list their game on Steam Greenlight. This grants access to the campaigning period where support must be gained from the Steam community. No restrictions exist on how many games can be submitted, so developers are free to promote multiple titles simultaneously or in the future. The fee covers lifetime access to Greenlight and is a worthwhile investment for any game with potential for commercial success on Steam. 
### Running Your Campaign
Gaining community support is crucial during the Greenlight campaign. Developers must actively promote their submission through social media, websites, forums, and any other means to spread awareness. Engaging with potential fans and answering their questions can help improve the chances of a **vote for their video game**. It is also important to consistently update Greenlight with new information, screenshots, or gameplay videos showing development progress. Maintaining buzz throughout the process keeps voters interested and more likely to support the title. While there is no set number of votes required, scoring highly demonstrates strong interest that catches Valve's attention.
### Obtaining Greenlight Approval
If a submission gains significant support and displays the qualities Valve looks for, the company may use its discretion to grant the project **Greenlight approval**. This seals the deal for full distribution on Steam upon completion. However, not all projects will earn this prestigious designation no matter how fervent their fanbase. Developers must aim to prove their game will deliver a high-quality, polished experience worthy of the Steam platform. Meeting certain undisclosed internal metrics is likely part of the approval calculus, so campaigning skill and vote numbers matter greatly.
### Completing Development
After the celebration of Greenlight approval dies down, the real work begins anew as development intensifies toward finishing the game. Additional time and funding may be required depending on the initial scope and progress made before Steam acceptance. It is essential to maintain communication with Valve to ensure all platform **requirements for Steam** will be met, such as integration of features like Steam Workshop, cloud saves, and matchmaking. Developers should never miss publicly stated milestones without addressing expectations. 
### Preparing for Launch  
When release nears, preparation ramps up to make the product fully optimized and ready for the Steam platform. Assets need to match conventions for visual style and sizing. Legal matters like EULAs and description content must be in order. Distribution versions must be compiled for Windows, Mac and Linux if applicable. Integration of features from the Steamworks toolkit unlocks social functionality and revenue potential. Demos or betas can generate additional buzz leading to the launch window. Ensuring a polished experience sets the game up for commercial success upon its highly anticipated Steam debut.
### Releasing on Steam
After months or years of effort, the big moment arrives to launch on Steam. The store page goes live with all key assets and information. Wishlists translate to day one sales as excited fans download the finished product. The initial release window brings a flood of new players, reviews and social engagement. An active PR campaign across outlets covers this milestone to reach gamers not already aware. The revenue share agreement with Valve takes effect, offering the potential for ongoing sales that deliver a return on all of the effort. With some good fortune, the game is met with acclaim and popularity on the coveted Steam platform.
### Post-Launch Support   
A lasting commitment to the title is still required even after launching on Steam. Issues must be swiftly addressed through patches and support channels. Engagement across Steam features and communities holds value. Potential DLC, expansions or sequels can further monetize the intellectual property in future. Developers who provide consistently great experiences establish goodwill with players and lay the groundwork for future projects proposed on Greenlight. With patient stewardship of the property and community over the long haul, success on Steam can breed ongoing prosperity for development studios.
