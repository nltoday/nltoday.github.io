### Reaching Gavi by road  
You can take a [KSRTC bus to the scenic Gavi region](https://store.fi.io.vn/funny-boxer-dog-lover-47-boxer-dog) in Kerala. The KSRTC, or **Kerala State Road Transport Corporation**, operates bus services across the state. Buses are a comfortable and affordable way to travel between cities if you don't have your own vehicle. 
However, if you’re travelling with friends or family, renting a jeep may be a better option to fully explore the landscapes around Gavi. The winding mountain roads can be navigated more easily in a jeep compared to larger vehicles. Have no fear - follow the roads even if they appear uncertain, as they truly do lead to amazing destinations.

### Boating on the lakes of Gavi
Once in Gavi, don't miss the opportunity to experience the natural beauty from the water. Go boating on the **crystal clear lakes surrounded by lush green forests**. Gently glide across the surface and admire the scenic views of the surroundings. Look out for colorful birdlife and occasional glimpses of wildlife on the shore. Boating is a relaxing way to spend an afternoon taking in the tranquility of the region.
### Spotting wildlife from a safe distance 
While wandering in the forests, keep your distance from any wild animals you may encounter. Gavi is home to various wildlife like leopards and King cobras. These creatures should be observed from afar for your safety. **Seek out designated spots in the forests that allow secure wildlife viewing** to catch glimpses of the natural inhabitants in their natural habitats. Binoculars or telescopes can help spot animals without disturbing them.
### Camping under the stars  
For a truly immersive forest experience, spend the night camping nearby. Search for established campsites that provide all necessary facilities while still feeling remote. As the sun sets, bask in the serenity of the night sky unobscured by light pollution. Fall asleep to the calming sounds of the forest and wake to nature's orchestra at dawn. Camping allows you to fully appreciate Gavi's tranquil forests surrounded by nature's beauty.
### Luxurious forest getaway  
For those seeking utmost comfort, opt for an eco-friendly villa located on the fringes of the forest. Wake up to spectacular **views of lush greenery right from your bed**. Spend relaxing evenings on your private veranda listening to the orchestra of the jungle. Luxurious villas offer the best of both worlds - tranquility in nature coupled with high-end amenities. This is an excellent choice for families or longer holidays in Gavi.  
### My dream of global adventures
A decade ago, my greatest ambition was to explore the far corners of the earth. As a young adult, I craved experiences of new cultures, languages, landscapes and ways of life. With no certainty of what the future held, I decided to pursue my travel dreams while I could. Since then, I've been fortunate to visit over 50 countries across six continents. Each unique destination offered joy, wonder and enriched my perspective in unexpected ways. I have no regrets about pursuing travel early - it was undoubtedly the best decision that opened my world.
### Magical rock formations in Arizona
One of my most memorable trips was hiking through the amazingly vibrant **Antelope Canyon in Page, Arizona**. The smooth sandstone ravines are etched with intricate curves and decorations created over millennia. Wandering through the narrow passages bathed in flickering orange and red light was like stepping into a surreal painting. The ephemeral play of light and shadow enhanced the ever-changing formations. No photo can truly capture Antelope Canyon's hypnotic and spiritual energy. It's a destination I'll forever carry in my heart.
### Exploring the mesmerizing Salar de Uyuni
Another top highlight was a multi-day jeep tour across the remarkable **Salar de Uyuni salt flats in southwest Bolivia**. The utter flatness and pure white expanse blending with the sky is an astonishing sight. We explored smaller lakes ringed by rainbows of salt deposits shaped by wind and rain. Navigating the "salar" during wet seasons mirrored the illusion of floating on clouds. In the evening, under a blanket of stars brighter than any city dweller could imagine, the experience touched my soul. The unique beauty of Salar de Uyuni is not to be missed.  
### Marveling at Plitvice Lakes' natural splendor
My trip to **Plitvice Lakes National Park in central Croatia** was awe-inspiring. Wandering the breathtaking trails between azure blue-green lakes connected by a series of waterfalls took my breath away. Layer upon layer of travertine barriers and limestone formations had developed over millennia, sculpting nature's masterpiece. Taking a boat ride to fully appreciate the turquoise waters and forested hillsides from the middle of Upper Lakes added another dimension. Plitvice Lakes' pristine natural beauty leaves visitors in wonder and willing champions of environmental protection.
### Standing before India's iconic Taj Mahal
When I finally ticked off visiting the **magnificent Taj Mahal in Agra, India** from my bucket list, I was not disappointed. Approaching the white marble mausoleum at dawn as the first light illuminated its flawless symmetrical design took my breath away. Wandering its polished corridors and taking in intricate carvings and inlaid precious stones in close detail showed incredible craftsmanship. Standing in the central chamber holding Emperor Shah Jahan’s casket and seeing it perfectly align with the tombs of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal outside through the central doorway gave me goosebumps. The scale of human achievement at the Taj Mahal humbles all who experience its grandeur.
### Beholding natural wonders in Iceland 
Iceland offered staggering beauty, from mighty glaciers and fjords to volcanic landscapes, raging rivers, lava fields and otherworldly rock formations. Hiking along **colorful coastal cliffs and black sand beaches** with the crashing North Atlantic waves in the background recharged my soul. Driving through rugged interior regions dotted with hot pools and tiny farmsteads revealed joy with every curve. Gazing upon the mesmerizing northern lights dancing green across the night sky is an experience beyond words. I've rarely felt more tiny yet connected to nature on Earth than in stunning Iceland. Its raw natural beauty left me in awe.
### My top recommendation for meaningful travels
In reflecting on my most fulfilling travel experiences over the past decade, I've learned the key is prioritizing rich cultural connections and natural wonders over checking off destinations. My most poignant memories come from multi-day volunteering opportunities like caring for rescued lions in South Africa, rather than fleeting tourist visits. Renting vehicles to freely explore remote places like the Namibian desert and Patagonian Andes also fostered profound appreciation. Overall, focusing trips around diverse hands-on experiences, rather than destinations, fostered deeper personal growth and a broader worldview. For truly enriching travels, seek out immersive activities that leave lasting impressions far beyond any snapshots. Experience, don't just visit places for a meaningful, life-enhancing journey.
