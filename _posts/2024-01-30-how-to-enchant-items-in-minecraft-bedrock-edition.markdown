### Enchanting with Commands
There are a few different ways to enchant items using commands in Minecraft Bedrock Edition. One method is to use the `/give` command to spawn in an already enchanted item. The command would look like this: `/give <player> <item> 1 0 {enchantments:[{id:"<enchantment>",lvl:<level>}]}`. For example, to give the player an iron sword enchanted with Sharpness level 5, you would type: `/give @p iron_sword 1 0 {enchantments:[{id:"minecraft:sharpness",lvl:5}]}`.
Another option is to use the `/enchant` command to add enchantments to an item the player is already holding. To enchant an item in this way, the player must be holding it in their hand. Then type a command like `/enchant @p sharpness 5` to add a Sharpness V enchantment to the held item.

### Getting Experience to Enchant
In order to [successfully enchant items](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-duck-gift-for-mom-mother-duckling-duck-waterfowl-lovers-v-neck-t-shirt/men&) at an enchantment table or book in Bedrock Edition, players need to have sufficient experience levels. Gaining experience is similar to Java Edition - players can mine resources, kill mobs, fish, breed animals, smelting items in a furnace, and more. Experience orbs will drop from slain mobs and broken blocks that can be collected by players. Once enough orbs are collected, the player's experience level will increase. Higher levels are required for stronger enchantments.
There are a few ways players can quickly gain experience levels in Bedrock Edition. Mobs like zombies and skeletons provide 1-3 experience orbs on death. **Killing multiples mobs in large **spawner farms quickly racks up orbs. Smelting a large quantity of items like stone or ores in a furnace array also efficiently gains experience. Finally, players with access to commands can use `/xp give <amount>` to manually add experience levels if needed.
### Enchanting at an Enchantment Table
Once players have collected enough experience levels, they can use an enchantment table to enchant **eligible items like tools, weapons, and armor**. To enchant, simply place the item you wish to enchant in the center input slot of the table. Then look at the three available enchantments shown. Higher level enchantments have a greater resource cost, shown by the number of experience levels required in the left slot. Click the item in the center to apply the highlighted enchantment, consuming the listed experience. Only one enchantment can be applied at a time through this method in Bedrock Edition. 
### Enchanting with Books
Another way to enchant items in Bedrock is by using **enchanted books found in structures like temples, libraries, and bastion remnants**. Books retain their enchantments when combined with a tool, weapon or armor using an anvil. This allows applying multiple enchantments to items. Books are also used to combine similar enchantments onto one item through an anvil. For example, combining two books with Efficiency III into one book with Efficiency VI. By combining enchanted books, players have more control over custom enchantment combinations compared to random table enchanting.
### Identifying Enchantments
To identify what enchantment an item has, players can either check the item's tooltip description shown when it's placed in a hotbar slot or held. Alternatively, use the `/inspect` command on the item or player holding it. This will display the **item name, ID, damage/durability value, and all the enchantments applied listed with their levels**. From this output, players can see exactly which enchantments were applied through commands, books, or an enchantment table.
In summary, creative Bedrock players have options for precisely enchanting items with commands. While survival players can collect experience through various means, then use an enchantment table or books at an anvil to customize their gear. Inspecting items clearly shows all the **enchantments applied for identification**. With the various ways to enchant available, players have full control over powering up their Minecraft arsenal in Bedrock Edition.
