### Understanding Where the Energy Comes From
We've been conditioned from a young age to believe that we need approval and acceptance from others to feel worthwhile. Growing up, we learn social norms and ways of dressing, acting and spending that are deemed acceptable by our peers and society. This teaches us from the start that there is a "right" way to behave and a "wrong" way, in order to be liked by others. 
Social media has taken this need for approval and popularity to new heights. Now we can publicly broadcast every detail of our lives and measure how much attention and validation we receive through things like likes, followers and shares. It's no wonder so many of us feel exhausted trying to manage our carefully crafted personas and ensure people continue thinking positively about us.  
After years caught in this endless cycle seeking approval, we realize it has not brought the acceptance and happiness we were promised. This social conditioning that there is only one "right" way to be is something we must learn to let go of.

### Adopting the Mantra "What Others Think of Me Is None of My Business"
At the root of caring too much about what people think is the mistaken belief that we have any control over their opinions of us. But the hard truth is that [we have no control over how others respond to or judge us](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-mom-dog-walker-funny-pun4510-t-shirt). No matter our intentions, people will form views independent of our efforts or desires.
Worrying over other people's perceptions comes from a place of ego that says their views somehow reflect on our self-worth. But the reality is that **what others think of us truly has nothing to do with who we are**. By accepting this, a huge weight lifts as we stop expending energy managing impressions and start living freely in the present moment. 
Repeating the mantra "what others think of me is none of my business" helps shift our mindset. With practice, it becomes easier to let go of attachment to outcomes and walk away knowing we were true to ourselves, regardless of any criticism.
### Redirecting Energy into Self-Care and Passion
No longer preoccupied worrying what others may say or do, a flood of time and mental space opens up. Rather than stressing over achieving some ideal image to gain approval, we can nurture self-acceptance from within. 
When distressing thoughts of judgment arise, take a deep breath and remind yourself of your mantra. Then divert excess energy to activities that fulfill and excite you, like **creative hobbies, spending time in nature, exercising, meditating** or simply enjoying life's small pleasures. Pursuing passions and practicing daily self-care, like eating well and getting enough sleep, are powerful ways to feel happier and more content as an individual.
### Building Daily Habits of Self-Love 
Learning not to tie our worth to how others see us is a lifelong journey. Forgive yourself for occasionally falling back into old patterns of seeking validation. On those days, double down on daily rituals that nourish your relationship with yourself, like journaling gratitudes or complementing your reflection.
Surrounding yourself with people who appreciate you for who you are, without conditions, also makes it easier to distance yourself from Judgmental opinions. Ultimately, the happier and more comfortable you feel in your own skin, the less importance negative perceptions from others will carry. Staying true to your authentic self is the key to living freely.
### Redirecting Perspective When Insecurities Arise  
Inevitably, negative thoughts will pop into our heads at times, tempting us to slip back into old habits of self-doubt or seeking approval. When this happens, pause and try redirecting your inner narrative. Remind yourself that people rarely dwell on others as much as we assume. They are generally preoccupied with their own lives.
Any criticism likely says more about the other person's internal state than you as an individual. If a view makes you uncomfortable, remember you have no obligation to internalize or act on it. By filling your time with meaningful pursuits and relationships, you'll have less headspace left for worrying what people may say behind your back.
Instead of fueling insecurities, shift mental energy to nurturing radical self-acceptance. You deserve to treat yourself with compassion. Stay determined to live wholeheartedly, without letting the perceived or real opinions of others define your worth or derail your joy. In time, this frees you to express your authentic self fearlessly.
### Practicing Non-Attachment and Self-Compassion  
True happiness comes from within, not from gaining approval or status in other people's eyes. Constantly seeking validation prevents us experiencing life fully in the present moment. Practicing non-attachment to outcomes and the natural ebb and flow of other's perceptions is key.
Be willing to disappoint anyone wishing you to conform to an image that doesn't feel right for your soul. You owe nothing to anyone but your authentic self. Compassion also extends to realizing critics usually say more about their own struggles than you. While acceptance from others can feel nice, basing self-worth on it leads to suffering.  
The path is not perfect, and setbacks will come. When they do, greet yourself with patience and kindness as you would a friend. This journey ultimately liberates us to pursue our passions without fear of judgment or what anyone thinks. That is a life filled with meaning and clarity - one where you stay radically true to your unique light.
