CareerTimes website has been promoting questionable online courses and programs by using misleading images of successful individuals without their consent. A closer examination reveals disturbing facts about the practices of this site.
### Misuse of Srinivas Kuchibhotla's Image  
One such disturbing instance was the use of a photo featuring the late Srinivas Kuchibhotla with his wife Sunayana Dumala. Srinivas was tragically shot dead in 2017 in an alleged hate crime in Kansas, United States. However, CareerTimes was displaying this photo with misleading claims about how one can earn a "dream lifestyle" through some online program. Using the image of a deceased victim of a hate crime to promote commercial offerings is in very poor taste and disrespectful to the deceased and his family.

### Doubtful Online Programs Questionably Promoted
A deeper dive into the promoted programs revealed they have characteristics of questionable multi-level marketing or pyramid schemes. Some of the programs advertised on CareerTimes demanded upfront fees of Rs. 4000 to Rs. 5000 for access to online "courses" that appeared to be of little real value. The flow of the website was also designed to push users towards registration and payment without allowing objective evaluation of what is really being sold. 
### Fake User Reviews and Restricted Feedback
The user review and feedback section on CareerTimes was also configured in a non-transparent manner. Users were unable to post any public reviews or feedback about the promoted programs. This raised suspicions about the authenticity of any glowing reviews showcased on the site. It seemed the site owners wanted to restrict any negative feedback that could discourage gullible users from registering and paying.
### Promoters with History of Dubious Practices 
Some of the programs and websites promoted through CareerTimes have a history of being involved in questionable money-making schemes in the past. For example, "Krishna Karpal" promoted through another associated website called "Work from Home" has previously been accused of running online scams. When checked on external forums, several complaints emerged about non-delivery of promised services after payment. 
### Legal and Ethical Issues with such Promotions
By publishing misleading images and restrictive reviews, CareerTimes seems to be employing dubious promotion tactics to lure unsuspecting job/money-seeking users. There are also concerns about whether the upfront fees demanded serve any legitimate purpose. Several characteristics of the promoted programs matched those called out in reports about online pyramid/Ponzi schemes. CareerTimes must be more responsible and follow basic ethical/legal guidelines in its marketing activities.
### Adverse Backlinks Aid such Dubious Businesses  
As rightly pointed out, merely publishing articles highlighting issues with such questionable websites could end up aiding them through backlinks. Search engines may interpret external links as votes of confidence for a website. This could help boost search rankings and visibility for dubious businesses, defeating the very purpose of consumer alerts. A better approach would be using screenshots instead of live links while still conveying the necessary information.
In summary, CareerTimes website and some programs promoted through it merit close scrutiny due to various misguiding and possibly illegal practices observed. Youth and job-seekers must stay vigilant and research thoroughly before parting with money on any online offers or programs. Proper legal/regulatory interventions may also be needed against websites that misuse people's images or operate questionably.
