### Getting Refunded for Valve Games
Valve games like [Left 4 Dead 2](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-custom-proud-football-grandma-number-28-personalized-women-v-neck-t-shirt/women&) are eligible for refunds within Steam. When refunding a Valve game purchased on Steam, the refund amount will be credited back to your Steam wallet rather than the original payment method. This allows you to reuse the funds to purchase other games on Steam. However, refunds are only possible within the first two weeks of purchase and if you have played less than two hours.

### Refunds Directly from Steam Are Rare 
For games purchased on Steam but not developed by Valve, refunds through Steam directly are very unlikely. Steam's refund policy only allows returns within two weeks of purchase and less than two hours of playtime. Beyond this narrow window, Steam will not offer refunds. Your only option is to try contacting Steam Support, but they have full discretion and commonly deny such late refund requests.
### Ask the Game Retailer for a Refund
If the game was purchased from an authorized Steam key retailer rather than on Steam itself, your best chance for a refund is to contact the retailer. Many allow refunds within a reasonable return window, such as Green Man Gaming or Fanatical. However, refund policies vary widely between retailers. It's always best to thoroughly research a store's return policy before making any purchases there.
### Steam Keys Cannot Be Refunded on Steam
One important thing to note - if you activate a Steam key purchased from an outside retailer, Steam will not offer a refund under any circumstances. Activating a key ties the game to your Steam account permanently. The only entity that can potentially refund a Steam key is the original retailer where the key was obtained from. Steam sees the transaction as already finalized once a key is redeemed.
### Contacting Steam Support Is Unlikely to Succeed  
As a last resort, you can try submitting a ticket to Steam Support to politely request an exception be made for your refund outside of Steam's guidelines. However, Steam has no obligation to grant refunds beyond their stated policy. Support agents have broad discretion, and most refund requests made long after purchase will be denied with a standard response. While it doesn't hurt to ask, don't get your hopes up for a positive outcome through this route.
### Your Best Option Is the Original Retailer
In nearly all cases, your only viable path to a potential refund on a Steam game is by contacting the original retailer where the game or Steam key was purchased from. For games bought directly on Steam, refunds are tightly constrained by Steam's brief refund window. Activated Steam keys cannot be refunded on Steam at all. As such, the refund policies of authorized key sellers usually present your sole refund opportunities in most situations after missing Steam's refund timeline. Be sure to understand each store's specific policies before any purchases there.
