## Starting the Journey Inwards
I used to suffer from loneliness and depression as well in my late teens and early twenties. It started around 17 or 18 years old when I broke up with my closest friend over something trivial and took it too personally. I was also deeply unhappy with myself and had very low self-esteem and confidence in who I was. 
### Withdrawing from Life 
To cope, I withdrew from living my life and turned to escapism. I watched far too much television as if in a trance, disconnecting from real interactions and experiences. I also started compulsively watching [problematic online content](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-boston-terrier-american-flag-usa-patriotic-dog-lover-v-neck-t-shirt/women&) and taking unnecessary risks by meeting strangers from dating sites. This only made my mental state worse over time.

### Seeking Help and Answers
Thankfully, when I entered university, I began seeing a counselor regularly through their free mental health services. I also tried antidepressants for six months but didn't feel like they helped how I wanted. Around this period, I went to a shaman and started a daily **meditation practice** to find inner peace. However, the root issues remained.
## Making Major Life Changes
### Leaving Comfort Behind 
Realizing I needed a bigger change, I resolved to break free of my circumstances. I donated nearly all my possessions, scans photos, and cleared out my life. With only a duffel bag, I went on a **hitchhiking adventure** through Washington and Oregon with just $60, seeking solace in nature.
### Heeding Wise Counsel 
During this time, I saw a Cambodian-American counselor who suggested truly getting away and experiencing Southeast Asia's warmer cultures. Only a short while later, I unexpectedly **bought a one-way ticket to Cambodia** after an epiphany with my then-girlfriend on the phone, deciding to follow my heart.
## Starting Anew in Cambodia 
### Adjusting to a New Environment
Arriving in Cambodia was certainly a major culture shock. The hospitable people and slow pace of life were a welcome change from back home. I focused on immerseing myself in **the local community** by volunteering and learning the language. Being around cheerful strangers who expected nothing of me helped lift my mood immensely. 
### Finding Work and Purpose 
To sustain myself, I quickly found an English teaching position that provided a modest income. Having students to guide and a reason to better myself each day gave my days more **meaning and fulfillment**. Over time, I felt much happier and at peace within myself in my new surroundings and lifestyle.
## Maintaining Wellbeing Back Home
### Applying Lessons Learned
Years later when I returned to America, I was determined to stay mentally well. I continued practices like daily journaling, meditation, spending time in nature, and being **mindful of negative influences**. I also limited consumption of upsetting news media and strove to focus on appreciated moments each day.
### Helping Others With Awareness
My experiences deeply changed my outlook on life and mental wellness. I now hope to **raise awareness on mindfulness, inner healing, and perspective shifts** that can help prevent or overcome depression, especially for those feeling lost or stuck in patterns. Simple changes, even just for a while, can make all the difference.
## Leading a Fulfilling Life Today  
### Thriving with Gratitude
In the present, I feel very fulfilled being married with children while still engaging in community projects. Every morning, I read inspiring messages from [website url] that keep me grounded. Most importantly, I live today with deep gratitude for all life has granted me so far in my journey.
### Continuing the Journey Inwards
My path of personal growth never ends, and that is what makes each new day an adventure. I aim to keep nurturing my **emotional intelligence, intuition, creativity,** and connections with compassion for myself and others. Life may bring unexpected turns, but with presence of mind and open heart, we can always find peace within.
