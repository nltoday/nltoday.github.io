The awards that celebrate the gaming industry each year hold different levels of prestige and credibility based on factors like nomination process, voting methods, and intended purpose. Two of the most popular award shows are The Game Awards and the Steam Awards, but a closer look reveals why the Steam community-driven awards carry more weight.
### An Honest Representation of Gamer Opinions
The Steam Awards are fully decided by user votes, allowing the true [opinions of PC gamers](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-sunflower-you-are-my-world-shirt-chihuahua-lovers-female-tshirt-dog-themed-gifts3549-t-shirt) to shine through in the nominated titles and winners each year. As the globe's largest digital PC game storefront with over 150 million active users, Steam provides a massive sample size to gauge what games resonate most with players. Comparatively, The Game Awards jury consists of just 95 influencers and media outlets who may be swayed by hype or publisher pressure in their nominations. A **small group's subjective views** cannot authentically represent the vast gaming population. 
By empowering the Steam community to have the final say, these awards celebrate games that found a meaningful connection with audiences rather than those that achieved fleeting popularity. **Titles honored through player voting** have proven staying power and longevity, distinguishing them as truly impactful experiences rather than flavor of the month selections. The **grassroots gamer endorsement** lends more authority to Steam Award victories than awards dictated by a tiny panel of insiders.

### Recognizing All Forms of Gaming Innovation
The Game Awards put unrealistic constraints on eligibility that exclude worthy candidates. By restricting nominations to titles available on all platforms, they penalize games with a focused scope or budget. The diverse options on Steam create a level playing field that is fair to **all developers regardless of size or budget**. Projects on diverse storefronts like itch.io or the Epic Games Store also do not qualify for consideration at The Game Awards. 
In contrast, the Steam Awards consider any game released or updated within their eligibility window. This fosters recognition of the full spectrum of PC games, from sprawling tripple-A epics to niche indie darlings. **Innovation comes in all shapes and sizes**, so the more inclusive eligibility honors projects pushing boundaries in their own right rather than those with mass market appeal. Honoring gaming excellence without prejudice gives the Steam Awards awards more credibility as a true celebration of the entire interactive art form.
### Showcasing Sustained Community Engagement     
One Steam Award category is "Labor of Love", which applauds live games that continue enriching themselves for players over many years. This important distinction acknowledges how ongoing developer passion and communication can cultivate vibrant long-term fan bases. **Longstanding community bonds** based on continuous updates, events, and improvements deserve recognition that The Game Awards do not provide.
By highlighting sustained creative efforts rather than a game's initial launch window, "Labor of Love" brings attention to subtle yet meaningful ways studios nourish existing fanbases. It offers inspiration and encouragement for ongoing commitment to **service games as a living product**. Whereas other awards glorify swift commercial success, Steam Awards respect the slow burn of diligently maintained interactive worlds. The perspective of honoring longevity lends the celebration additional merit.
### Transparency and the Absence of Hype  
While The Game Awards claim a "blended jury and public vote", the lopsided 90-10 split in the jury's favor leaves outcomes vulnerable to promotion and popularity biases. Steam Awards results are purely determined by community voting without outside influence. **Complete transparency gives weight to every individual vote cast.**  
The lack of celebrity presenters, corporate advertising dollars, or PR spectacle around the Steam awards means hype rarely factors into the process. **Voting hinges only on merit recognized by engaged players**, avoiding distortion from manufactured buzz or publisher dollars. Meritocracy untainted by commercial allegiances makes the honors more credible reflections of gaming excellence according to the people who experience the medium most intimately.
### Recognizing Unsung Genres 
Certain game types like visual novels or simulation games rarely achieve mainstream success but retain passionate yet niche followings. The Steam Awards provide recognition within micro-communities through "Better with Friends" and specific genre awards. Whereas major shows glorify franchises with mass appeal, these categories laud the intimate, off-beat games that enrich smaller demographics. 
By acknowledging the full diversity of the PC gaming landscape, Steam Awards do not limit validity to blockbuster spectacles. **Appreciating unsung corners of the hobby** enriches discussions and promotes hidden gems deserving of acclaim. Marginalized genres and tightly-knit fanbases feel respected and validated through these spotlight opportunities lacking at bigger ceremonies. Representing gaming in all its variety boosts the awards' inclusiveness and standing within the community.
### Summary
The Steam Awards distinguish themselves as a celebration with true integrity and significance within the PC gaming sphere. Largely free of corporate politics and third party influence, the community-driven process authentically honors memorable experiences according to the people who play games most passionately. Factor like transparency, a level playing field for all developers, and consideration for longevity, niche genres and independent voices give the honors more credibility and prestige than inflated mainstream spectacles. By recognizing gaming excellence on its own meritocratic terms, the Steam Awards uphold principles that elevate their standing as one of the industry's most respected celebrations.
