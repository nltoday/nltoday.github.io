## Introduction 
Managing your privacy and communication preferences is important, especially for businesses. While popular messaging apps like WhatsApp provide convenient calling features, these are not always suitable for all use cases. This article explores options to disable WhatsApp calling on your phone if you would prefer not to receive calls through the app. 
### Your Current Situation
As a business owner, you rely on phone call recordings for legal protection and keeping accurate records of agreements and discussions with customers. However, WhatsApp calls cannot be recorded, bypassing your regular recording systems. To maintain verbal records, you would rather customers call your regular phone number instead of through WhatsApp.

### Workaround Limitations  
Your current workaround of not answering WhatsApp calls and returning calls on your regular phone, while it works, is not ideal. Technical issues may arise and confuse customers. You would benefit from a cleaner solution to prevent WhatsApp calls altogether if possible.
## Sacrificing Audio Functionality 
One potential approach is to deny WhatsApp access to your phone's microphone, which is required for calls and audio chats. 
### Revoking Microphone Permissions
By going into your phone settings and revoking the microphone permission for WhatsApp, anyone attempting to call you through the app would first be prompted to grant access. This could act as a barrier to discourage WhatsApp calls.
### Limitations of This Method 
However, revoking microphone access also disables your own ability to make WhatsApp calls or use audio functions. **This significantly limits the app's voice and audio chat functionality,** making it less useful as a communication tool overall. For a business that still needs WhatsApp for messaging, this may not be an ideal long-term solution.
## Relying on Third-Party Apps 
A more targeted approach could involve using custom [WhatsApp mod apps](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/alewine) with extra call blocking features. 
### WhatsApp Mods and Call Blocking 
Unofficial third-party WhatsApp apps exist that modify the standard experience. Some claim to allow call blocking for specific contacts. By installing one of these mods, it may be possible to block just customers from calling through WhatsApp while still accepting calls from friends and families. 
### Risks of Using Modded Apps
However, using modded WhatsApp apps violates the service's terms and could result in account termination. For a business account, this poses unacceptable risks. There are also no guarantees certain mods actually work as advertised or are safe to use long-term. 
## Accepting WhatsApp Calls' Limitations
After exploring options, the safest approach may simply be accepting the technical limitations of WhatsApp calls rather than finding workarounds. 
### Maintaining Phone Recording 
You can continue recording all phone conversations as usual. Clearly communicate your phone number to customers for important discussions and agreements that require records. 
### Using WhatsApp Appropriately
Restrict WhatsApp to less critical informal check-ins where a recorded call is unnecessary. This maintains appropriate use of both communication tools without workarounds or third-party apps that introduce privacy or security risks. 
### Requesting WhatsApp Improvements
You can also join others in politely requesting optional call blocking features through official feedback channels. But for now, this balanced approach of recording phone calls and using WhatsApp differently seems the most sensible path forward given technical limitations.
## Conclusion
In summary, while frustrating for certain use cases, there is no fully safe and supported way to disable WhatsApp calling on your phone currently. The best approach is recording important calls as usual on your regular phone line and limiting WhatsApp communication as needed to avoid risks. With patience and by explaining your needs to customers, you can still effectively manage your communication preferences within WhatsApp's existing capabilities.
