### The Longtime Crush
John had liked his classmate Jane for over 7 years. They knew each other well and got along, but John never found the courage to confess his feelings. One day, he decided to take a chance and message Jane on Facebook telling her how he felt. However, all he received in return was a small "seen" notification, with no reply. Disheartened, John assumed his feelings were onesided.

### Deepening Friendship
Around the same time, John's good friend Mark had also started developing feelings for someone. Mark confided in John, revealing his [first crush](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/aday) was on their mutual friend Sarah. While Mark guessed various names trying to uncover who Jane liked, she remained tightlipped, not wanting to hurt his feelings by revealing it was in fact him she had feelings for. 
### A Restless Night
That evening, Mark messaged Jane repeatedly, desperately wanting to know the identity of her mystery crush. Unable to keep it in any longer, Jane finally revealed the truth - that it was Mark himself she had fallen for. To her surprise, Mark shared that he too had come to realize he had stronger feelings for Jane than just a crush, and had been left worried all day not knowing who she cared for.
### A Happy Beginning
Overjoyed at discovering their **mutual romantic interest**, Mark and Jane began dating. Four wonderful years later, they remain very much in love. Though John's confession to his longtime crush Jane had not gone as hoped, he took comfort in seeing his two close friends find happiness together despite the challenges of an unexpected love growing between longtime friends.
### Easing Into Friendship 
Across town, Emma had slowly been getting to know and appreciate her classmate Dylan over the past six months. While they got along well as friends, Emma was unsure if Dylan felt the same non-platonic connection she was starting to. Not wanting to ruin their budding friendship but also tired of keeping her feelings private, Emma decided to take a chance and gently confess how she felt to Dylan.
### An Ambiguous Response 
When Emma told Dylan "I like you", hoping for clarification on if her feelings were mutual, she received a lukewarm and confusing response. Dylan simply replied "Umm... SO? A lot of people like me". Taken aback, Emma was left questioning if Dylan even saw her as more than an acquaintance or if her confession had just made things awkward between them.
### Looking For Clarity 
Unsure how to interpret Dylan's ambiguous reaction, over the next few weeks Emma subtly tried gauging if his feelings had changed at all. However, Dylan gave no clear signals either way and continued interacting with Emma the same friendly but platonic manner as before. With their semester coming to an end, Emma hoped that with some distance over the summer break, she might gain more clarity on where they stood when school resumed in the fall. Whether their friendship could deepen into something more remained to be seen.
### An Unexpected Spark  
While Mark and Jane's love story had a happier beginning than Emma and Dylan's, unexpected connections can develop in many forms. Through open communication and patience, initial disappointments do not have to define relationships and feelings that start as friendship may blossom into something deeper with time. Both pairs of classmates found that hidden sparks existed between longtime friends, sometimes requiring courage and vulnerability to uncover an unexpected love.
