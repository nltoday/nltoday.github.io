With Windows 10, Microsoft has created a truly unified experience that allows you to seamlessly continue your work across all your devices, whether it be a smartphone, tablet, laptop or desktop. The [Universal Windows Platform](https://yt.io.vn/collection/alberti) enables developers to build apps that work across all Windows 10 devices using a common code base. You can start an activity on one device and pick it up on another with features like **Universal Clipboard** and **Your Phone** integration.
Windows 10 also brings **Continuum**, allowing 2-in-1 devices and phones to switch seamlessly between tablet and desktop modes with the appropriate interface depending on how the device is used. This cross-device experience is unmatched by other platforms and makes Windows 10 the most versatile operating system available.
### Superior Productivity and Multitasking Capabilities
Windows 10 takes productivity and multitasking to the next level with features like Snap Assist, virtual desktops and **Split View**. Snap Assist and virtual desktops allow you to customize your workspace and have multiple apps and windows open simultaneously without clutter. 
Split View further enhances multitasking by letting you view two apps side by side on the same desktop. You can drag and drop windows to quickly arrange them in different configurations. Other new multitasking features like **Timeline** allow you to pick up from where you left off across devices. All these productivity capabilities make Windows 10 highly efficient for business users.

### Built-in Security and Protection 
Security is a top priority in Windows 10. Features like **Device Guard**, **Windows Hello** and **Windows Defender** make Windows 10 one of the most secure operating systems available. Device Guard blocks unauthorized applications from running while Windows Hello enables biometric authentication with facial recognition or fingerprint for secure sign-ins. 
Windows Defender, the built-in antivirus, protects your device from viruses, spyware and other malware. Regular security updates further strengthen protection through the lifecycle of the device at no additional cost to the user. Windows 10 approaches security holistically across hardware, OS and software for robust defense against emerging threats.
### Powerful Gaming Platform
Advanced technologies like **DirectX 12** and the **Windows Gaming** app make Windows 10 the best Windows version for gaming yet. DirectX 12 enables significant graphics performance improvements for optimized titles. The Xbox app brings Xbox Live features and Game Pass subscription to Windows 10, allowing you to play over 100 high-quality PC games.  
You can also stream Xbox games from an Xbox One console to your Windows 10 PC. Upcoming features like auto HDR and support for variable refresh rate displays will continue enhancing the Windows 10 gaming experience. All these capabilities make Windows 10 the premier platform for PC gaming.
### Intelligent Digital Assistant - Cortana
Cortana is a highly intelligent digital assistant created by Microsoft to be helpful, harmless and honest. Cortana can remind you of important events, manage your schedule, search web and local files for information, check weather and traffic conditions and more with just voice commands or text interaction.
Being **context aware**, Cortana adapts based on how you use your device to surface information and content that interests you. She can recognize contacts in messages and provide contextually aware responses. Powered by machine learning capabilities of Microsoft, **Cortana continues to improve in understanding natural language** and being more helpful over time. 
Cortanaâ€™s natural and seamless integration within Windows 10 makes it easy to get tasks done or find information through conversation with the digital assistant from anywhere in the OS. This innovation helps improve productivity while enhancing the overall user experience.
### Always Up-to-Date Through Windows as a Service
Unlike traditional operating systems, Windows 10 is delivered as-a-service with regular feature and security updates available via Windows Update. This eliminates the need for upgrades and allows Microsoft to continuously incorporate new functionality and refine the OS experience over time based on usage patterns. 
Updates can be anywhere between small fixes to large feature updates that roll out twice annually and feel like upgrades. Windows Update ensures every Windows 10 device has the latest security defenses from day one at no extra cost. Users also get new features without waiting for an entire new version. 
This service model provides an **always up-to-date experience** reflecting Microsoft's commitment to deliver Windows 10 as a living, breathing platform. Users of Windows 10 Pro and Enterprise can even control updates and deploy on their schedule through Windows Update for Business.
### Customizable and Personalizable  
Windows 10 introduces a new dimension of personalization and customization compared to previous versions. You can modify Start menu, taskbar, desktop wallpapers, sounds and ease of access options as per preferences without compromising functionality. 
Themes, color options and ability to organize Start menu into folders allow for high levels of user customization. Windows Ink Workspace provides creative tools for pen and touch users. Windows 10 S is also an option for lightweight tablets and low-powered laptops that focuses on security and online services. 
Ultimately, Windows 10 adapts to individual needs while maintaining consistency across devices. This ability to personalize enhances productivity and keeps the OS feeling fresh even after years of continued use and updates.
So in summary, Windows 10 is the best Windows operating system with its unified experience, superior productivity capabilities, built-in security features, powerful gaming optimizations, intelligent Cortana digital assistant and always up-to-date nature through the Windows as a Service model. The adaptability, longevity and versatility of Windows 10 make it a future-proof choice as both a personal and business platform.
