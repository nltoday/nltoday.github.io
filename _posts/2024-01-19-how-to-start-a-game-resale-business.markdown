When starting any business, the first step is to obtain the proper licensing and permits from your state government. For a game resale business, this means applying for a retailer or resale permit. 
### Wholesale Game Access 
With a valid resale permit in hand, you'll be able to purchase games directly from distributors at wholesale prices. This is a major advantage over buying retail, as you'll be able to offer lower prices to customers while still turning a profit. Be sure to research which game publishers and [digital distribution platforms](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-summer-vintage3422-t-shirt) offer wholesale programs.

### Evaluating Inventory
Carefully consider which types of games to stock based on popularity, margins, and anticipated demand. **Blockbuster titles** from major publishers are usually a safe bet but may have lower profit margins. Indie and ** niche games** could offer bigger profits per sale but come with more risk if they don't sell well. Test out a variety of titles when first starting out to find the right balance. 
### Online Storefront Options
Many new stores choose to sell exclusively online for convenience. Platforms like **eBay** and **Amazon** make it easy to reach customers worldwide with very low upfront costs. However, you'll have little control over the shopping experience and face steeper fees. Consider a custom **e-commerce website** hosted on platforms like Shopify or WooCommerce for more autonomy and branding opportunities. 
### Physical or Online?
For added flexibility and visibility, incorporate both online and offline sales channels. Setting up a small retail space, even just a kiosk in a local mall, allows interested customers to browse inventory in person. But be prepared for higher overhead from a brick-and-mortar location. Test various hybrid models to see what works best for your target audience and budget.
### Payment Processing  
No matter the sales channels, accept a wide range of **payment methods** for added customer convenience like major credit cards, PayPal, Venmo, etc. Payment processors like Stripe offer affordable monthly rates and integration with popular shopping carts and online stores. Be sure any processor meets PCI compliance standards to protect sensitive customer financial data.
### Regional Pricing Considerations  
When sourcing inventory internationally, remember that **regional pricing differences exist**. Games may be significantly cheaper in some worldwide markets even after import fees. However, be aware of any licensing or other legal issues regarding selling cross-border. For simplicity, focus initially on domestic inventory sources close to your customer base.
### Used Digital Game Keys   
Digital game key resale through sites like G2A can expand your offerings beyond physical discs and cartridges. However, there are caveats to consider. Authenticity and origin of keys cannot always be verified. Sellers face risks of banned or revoked keys if they were improperly obtained. Monitor this evolving segment carefully as platforms adjust policies on transferring digitally purchased licenses.
### Customer Service is Key
No matter the business model, provide top-notch customer care to build loyalty and repeat sales. Promptly resolve issues, accept returns when reasonable, and offer membership perks like ** loyalty programs and exclusive deals**. Engagement on social platforms and a company blog helps put faces to the brand while highlighting new releases and sales. Positive reviews across these touchpoints will fuel organic growth.
### Analytics and Testing for Growth
Use website analytics and merchant dashboard stats to continuously optimize operations. A/B test different page designs, prices, and promotions. Adjust inventory based on sales data to minimize waste. Consider adding related game accessories or **merchandise** as supplemental revenue streams. Incremental growth requires ongoing experimentation informed by real customer behavior and purchase insights.
