### Connecting Wii Remotes Without Native Support
Despite the Nintendo Switch not having native support for Wii Remotes, there are still options available to allow their usage. One of the main reasons for the lack of compatibility is likely due to Nintendo wanting to avoid confusion between the Wii and Switch interfaces and branding. However, through the use of adapters, it is possible to pair and use Wii Remotes with the latest Nintendo console.

### Updating the Firmware of the Mayflash MagicNS Adapter  
One popular adapter for connecting Wii Remotes is the Mayflash MagicNS. This device can pair and translate the control inputs of Wii Remotes, Nunchuks and more to communicate with the Switch. However, to enable compatibility, the MagicNS firmware must be updated through a PC. A video guide shows the simple process to upgrade and begin using Wii controllers after connecting the adapter. While an effective solution, the MagicNS does not allow for remapping of buttons seen by the Switch OS.
### The Brooks Super Converter Adapter
An alternative is the Brooks Super Converter, a versatile adapter that enables the use of Wii Remotes, Wii U Pro Controllers and PS4 controllers on the Nintendo Switch. It also functions on PlayStation consoles and PC. Reviews indicate it performs well with little latency. A benefit over the MagicNS is [ customizable button mapping](https://store.fi.io.vn/funny-chihuahuas-halloween-costume-witch-chihuahua-dog-lover-312-chihuahua-dog) since the Switch recognizes it as a native controller. Videos demonstrate it in action on the hybrid console. The Brooks Super Converter provides a high-quality option for those wanting to use legacy Nintendo controllers.
### Compatibility Testing with Popular Games
Upon connecting Wii Remotes via an adapter, they generally map inputs similarly to a Pro Controller. This translates well for gameplay in titles like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Reports from users find the experience to be comparable to modern Switch controllers with only minor issues, such as the Wii Remote minus button not functioning in some cases. Launching games readily recognizes the adapted remotes. The technology allows enjoying family-favorite Switch titles in new ways with the familiar controllers already owned.
### Adapter Recommendations and Where to Purchase
For those seeking an affordable means of using Wii Remotes with their Switch, both the Mayflash MagicNS and Brooks Super Converter receive recommendations. The latter gets slight preference for its remap capability and wider device support. These adapters can run between $30-40 and are commonly found on websites such as Stone Age Gamer, eBay or other online retailers. Consumers should research the specific features of each to determine the best fitting option. With a simple accessory, nostalgic Nintendo peripherals find new life on the modern console.
### Alternatives Using Other Adaption Devices
While the MagicNS and Brooks adapters provide plug-and-play solutions, tinkerers may explore alternative setups. The CronusMAX Plus is a popular multi-system adapter that enables the usage of legacy controllers on modern platforms. By pairing it with a converter for Nintendo or PlayStation controllers, early reports claim it can translate Wii Remote inputs to the Switch. However, these improvised methods lack first-party support and widespread documentation for issues that may arise.
### Comparing Wii Remotes to Joy-Con Controllers  
A comparison of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk against Joy-Con reveals their differences in features and button inputs. While both offer **motion controls and rumble**, the Joy-Con have more precise **gyro/accelerometer tracking** without extra accessories. They also include **HD rumble, NFC amiibo support** and capture capabilities. Button-wise, Joy-Con provide more flexibility with additional inputs like shoulder buttons usable in either grip orientation. This expanded control scheme aids modern gameplay over the restricted Wii inputs.
### Finding Game Compatibility
Not all Switch games will work seamlessly with adapted Wii Remotes due to differing control schemes. Developers would need to support their unique button mapping. Titles building upon typical controller features like HD rumble may not function as intended. Testing individual games is recommended to gauge compatibility before dedicating to this input method. With some experimentation, many classic and casual Switch games can still be enjoyed with the retro peripherals thanks to community-driven workarounds.
