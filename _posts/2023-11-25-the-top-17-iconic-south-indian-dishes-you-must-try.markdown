### Masala Dosa
A crisp **rice and lentil crepe** known as **dosa** is a must-try when in South India. The masala dosa takes it to another level by stuffing the crispy dosa with a lightly spiced potato filling.

### Akki Roti
A staple in Karnataka, **akki roti** is a gluten-free flatbread made from **finger millet flour**. Cooked on a tawa, these rotis have a unique nutty flavor and are the perfect vehicle for curries.

The richly aromatic **Hyderabadi biryani** is a specialty of the Nizams of Hyderabad. Layered with tender pieces of meat or vegetables and fluffy basmati rice flavored with saffron and spices, it is a true labor of love. Cooling raita and pickled onion complement the flavors beautifully in this signature dish.
### Pav Bhaji
A beloved Mumbaikar staple, **pav bhaji** is the ultimate street food indulgence. A thick, mildly spiced vegetable stew is served piping hot alongside soft bread rolls called **pav**. The garlicky, buttery stew is eaten by squeezing it into the rolls for hearty bites of comfort in every mouthful.
