### A Dream Come True
It was the 24th of April 2017 when I had one of the best days of my life. I was lucky enough to **meet Virat Kohli, the Indian cricket superstar and my inspiration**, in person. I entered the room where he was relaxing on the sofa and was dumbstruck seeing him up close. When I went near to touch his feet out of respect, he kindly told me not to and invited me to sit beside him instead. We talked as he looked at the sketch and letter I had brought for him. He was full of praise and signed it for me, knowing how much he inspires millions like myself.

### An Inspiring Personality
During our conversation, I told Virat that my sister is a big fan of his. His response of "Tell her, thanks for the love!" showed his humility. He looked exceptionally dashing in real life just as many fans and followers had described. Virat mentioned that he was glad to be an inspiration for people. His smile in the photos from that day captured how fulfilling it must be for him to motivate others through his achievements on the field. It was a moment I will cherish forever and an experience much more nerve-wracking than a job interview!
### A Chance Encounter on a Flight
In May 2013, I was travelling to Chennai with a stop in Ranchi. While waiting for all passengers to board, I was playing a [mobile game called Flick Football](https://store.fi.io.vn/work-hard-so-my-rat-terrier-live-a-better-dog-lover-2). That's when Virat Kohli along with other star cricketers like Chris Gayle, Zaheer Khan and AB de Villiers walked into the flight. All the girls gasped seeing Virat enter. During the mid-flight, when I was returning to my seat, the aisle was blocked by an air-hostess' food trolley. **I noticed Virat playing a similar game on his tablet but struggling with it**. When he saw me smiling, he handed me his tablet requesting for help. I managed to complete the level and he gave me a hi-five, making it a really cool experience.
### Another Memorable Autograph
Back in 2011, I attended the inaugural ceremony of Champions League T20 at Bangalore's Palace Grounds along with friends. We had tickets to a stand close to where the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) players like Mayank Agarwal, Manish Pandey, Anil Kumble and Daniel Vettori were stationed. Smartphones were new then so not many selfies were possible. However, we weren't in the VIP section where the players interacted more. My friend was a big fan of Vettori and wanted his autograph badly. 
### Virat to the Rescue 
Seeing her frustration, I started calling out loudly to Vettori along with doing the 'V' sign with my hands. Virat Kohli, who was still an up and coming young player then, noticed us. He promptly walked down to our stand, took our paper and signed it for us. But my friend was still adamant on Vettori's autograph. We requested Kohli if he could speak to Vettori about it and to our surprise, he did just that, helping us get both signatures - an absolutely unexpected outcome! Even today, this story brings a smile on our faces.
### A Chance Encounter on a Flight
A few years ago in May 2013, I was travelling to Chennai with a stopover in Ranchi. While waiting at the airport for all passengers to board, I passed my time playing a mobile game called Flick Football. That's when Virat Kohli walked into the flight along with star cricketers Chris Gayle, Zaheer Khan and AB de Villiers. All the girls present let out an audible gasp seeing Virat enter. 
During the mid-flight journey when I was on my way back to my seat, the aisle was blocked by an air-hostess's food trolley. Thatâ€™s when I spotted Virat engaged in a **game similar to the one I was playing earlier on his tablet**. However, he seemed to be struggling with it. When he noticed my smiling looking at him, he handed me his device requesting for help to pass that particular level. I was able to complete it smoothly and he gave me a friendly fist bump, making the brief interaction really memorable.
