Two common Malaysian greetings are "Apa khabar?" and "assalamualaikum". "Apa khabar?" directly translates to "What's the news?" but is used as a casual greeting similar to "How are you?". A typical response would be "Khabar baik" meaning "Good news" or "all is well". 
"Assalamualaikum" is an Arabic-influenced greeting meaning "Peace be upon you" commonly used among Malaysian Muslims. It's polite to respond with "Waalaikumussalam" which translates to "And peace be also upon you".
