### Personal Gold Allowance for Indian Citizens
As per the customs rules laid out by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), Indian citizens are allowed to bring a certain quantity of gold jewelry depending on their gender without having to pay any customs duty. Male passengers can carry **gold jewelry worth up to INR 50,000** while female passengers' limit is set at **INR 1,00,000 worth of gold jewelry**. The duty exemption is applicable to children under the age of 18 years as well, provided the gold is for personal use.

### Rules for Stays Abroad Longer than One Year
Indian passengers who have been residing outside India in any country, including Dubai, for a continuous period of over one year are eligible for higher gold import limits. Such travelers can bring in **gold jewelry weighing 20 grams worth up to INR 50,000[ if male and ](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/alcock)40 grams worth up to INR 1,00,000** if female without paying any customs duties. This relaxed rule applies to gold from Dubai as well as that being carried from other foreign locations.
### Declaring Excess Gold Quantity
In case someone is carrying gold jewelry exceeding these prescribed limits, they need to declare the excess quantity to the customs officials. A **declaration form needs to be filled providing details like type of gold, exact weight and value** being imported. On assessment, customs will calculate applicable import duties which currently range between 10-12.5% of the value. The duty amount can be paid through cash, debit/credit cards, net banking or mobile wallets. 
### Gold in Bar or Coin Form Attracts Duty
While gold jewelry up to the prescribed limits is exempted from duty, gold in the form of bars or coins is taxable irrespective of quantity. Passengers who have stayed abroad for over 6 months can import 1 kg of gold in bar or coin form but will have to pay import duties on it which increases its market cost substantially. Instead, bringing theequivalent value in jewelry form would be cheaper.
### Procedures for Declaring Excess Gold 
To avoid penalties, it is important for passengers to follow proper procedures for declaring any gold over the free allowance. Not doing so can attract confiscation along with financial and legal consequences. Here are the step-by-step processes involved:
### Filling the Declaration Form
Upon arrival, passengers need to go to the customs red channel with their **baggage and filled gold declaration form**. The form requires key details like **full name, passport number, permanent address, contact details, details of gold like type, purity, weight** being imported over the limits.
### Assessment by Customs Officers 
The passenger submits this form to customs officials who will **physically assess the quantity of gold declared**. They **check weight and worth against documentary proofs** to determine the exact import duties payable. Any under-declaration can lead to penalties.
### Duty Payment Procedure
After finalizing the duty amount, passengers clear the payment using acceptable **digital modes like debit/credit cards, UPI, net banking**. Cash payment options may vary as per airport rules. **Receipt of duty paid needs to be collected before gold release**.
### Collection of Excess Gold
Only after confirmation of full duty clearance, the passenger will be allowed to take possession of the **entire gold declared and assessed by customs**. Failing to follow any step can cause delays and risks of legal action or need of assistance from customs house agents.
### Maintaining Supporting Documents
It is advisable for passengers to carry relevant **documents supporting the gold purchase like invoices, receipts from jewelers abroad** in original. This strengthens their case if customs requires any document verification while assessing import duties on over-limit gold. Airports may also demand a valid identity and address proof.
### Limits on Gold Coins and Bars 
While Indian citizens and NRIs can freely import precious metal bars, coins and ornaments within the prescribed limits, there are certain restrictions too. NRIs who have stayed abroad for over 6 months can bring 1 kg of gold **in the form of standard bullion bars or coins** into India against a valid jeweler's invoice.
### Payment of Applicable Customs Duties
However, it is important to note that import of gold bars or coins is subjected to customs duty. As per current rules, passengers need to pay a basic **customs duty of 10% on the value assessed by customs authorities.** An additional Social Welfare Surcharge of 10% is also levied on the basic customs duty amount.
### conclusion
To summarize, Indian customs allows its citizens to bring gold jewelry within prescribed limits as a duty-free baggage while declaring excess quantity attracts import duty. Following due processes helps avoid issues while carrying gold between India and Dubai or any foreign location. It is advisable to be updated about any changes in rules by regularly checking government portal and consulting customs officers. Proper documentation and compliance ensures smooth gold import and export.
