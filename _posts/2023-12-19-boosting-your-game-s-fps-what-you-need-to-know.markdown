### Understanding Frame Rates and Your PC's Capabilities
When playing games, your computer's graphics card and CPU work together to generate frames at a certain rate, known as the frame rate or FPS (frames per second). Most games have a hardcoded "FPS cap" to limit the frame rate for performance and gameplay reasons. While it may seem appealing to boost your FPS higher than the cap, doing so doesn't actually make the game run any smoother - it just causes unnecessary stress on your hardware.
Any frames rendered beyond the cap are simply repeated, as the game engine isn't programmed to handle more inputs. This extra rendering load puts strain on your GPU and CPU without providing a benefit. In extreme cases, it can lead to overheating issues. The ideal scenario is to optimize your settings to hit the native FPS cap as smoothly as possible without going above it.

### Potential Risks of Using FPS Unlockers
Some players use third-party "FPS unlocker" programs and tools to override the in-game cap. While this used to risk account bans in some games, most developers have since adjusted their anti-cheat systems. However, consistently exceeding the engine's limitations with an unlocker is still risky for [hardware overheating](https://store.fi.io.vn/french-bulldog-frenchie-dog-black-dog-lover-frenchies-1). It's generally best to avoid unnecessary stress on your components whenever possible.
If you do choose to experiment with higher frame rates using an unlocker, monitor your GPU and CPU temperatures closely. The first signs of overheating are often higher-than-normal idle temps or thermal throttling under load. It's always better to prioritize long-term hardware health over marginal gains in perceived smoothness above the FPS cap. Consider optimizing graphics settings or upgrading components before routinely pushing limits.
### Separating Fact from Fiction on Bans
In the past, blanket ban waves by games like PUBG incorrectly flagged FPS unlocker users alongside actual cheaters due to anti-cheat limitations. Thankfully, wrongly-banned players were later reinstated once the issues were addressed. However, some myths persist online that unlockers are still a bannable offence in certain titles. 
In reality, as long as the unlocker software itself doesn't interact with game files or memory in a way that could be confused for hacking, they are generally considered safe to use nowadays. That said, individual games may punish advertised or aggressive use of unlockers in their communities if it contradicts their vision of fair play. It's best to check each game's policies or readdeveloper statements on the topic.
### Finding the Right Balance for your Setup
In the end, boosting your frame rate with unlockers or overclocking comes down to balancing performance versus longevity for your specific hardware configuration. Newer, higher-end PCs may have more headroom for experimenting above FPS caps without heat issues. But it's never advisable to routinely tax older, lower-spec systems far beyond their intended limits.
The best approach is to do some benchmark testing at different settings presets and frame rates to understand your components' thermal and performance thresholds. Then choose optimized in-game graphical quality at or just above the native FPS limit for your preferred combination of smoothness, visual fidelity and long-term stability. With some tuning, you can hit that sweet spot without compromising hardware health or risking punishments.
### Monitoring Your Systems and Taking Precautions
If you do decide to experiment with FPS boosting, investing in a basic temperature monitoring program is recommended for safety. Several free and open-source options like **Open Hardware Monitor** allow real-time viewing of critical components like the GPU, CPU and VRMs. With it running in the background, you can keep an eye on thermals during extended gaming sessions. 
Having additional case fans for airflow and using a elevated stand can also help disperse excess heat. Consider undervolting or limiting power draw on laptops as an alternative to outright overclocking for longevity's sake. Stay alert to any sudden increase in idle temperatures after intensive gaming as an early warning sign. With some basic precautions, you can optimize performance while protecting your valuable hardware investment over the long run.
### Summary
In summary, while FPS unlockers may be safer to use now than in the past, it's generally better not to routinely exceed your system's capabilities. Use monitoring tools to find each game's optimized settings for your configuration at or near the FPS cap. With careful tuning instead of recklessly pushing limits, you can balance smooth visuals and component health without risking hardware damage or bans down the line. Always prioritize stability, safety margins and the long-term functioning of your investment over uncertain claims of perceived improvements above hard caps. Happy and responsible gaming!
