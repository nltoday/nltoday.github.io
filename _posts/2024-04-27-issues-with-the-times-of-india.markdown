## Lack of Fact-Checking and Provocative Language
The Times of India is known to post news on social media without properly confirming facts or doing sufficient background research. **As seen in the example of repeatedly posting about Aamir Khan stepping down as brand ambassador of Incredible India, they lacked verification and seemed more interested in generating engagement through provocative headlines.** 
This is further exemplified by their coverage of the PVR theater incident involving a Muslim family allegedly not standing for the national anthem. While The Hindu took an objective viewpoint, ToIâ€™s headline **"Muslim family asked to leave PVR theatre for allegedly not standing up in respect of the National anthem"** seems intended to stir controversy. 
### Bias in Deepika Padukone Coverage
In the infamous articles responding to Deepika Padukone's statements, ToI showed blatant victim-blaming and hypocrisy. As the Youth Ki Awaaz article explained, ToI questioned why she was objecting to a video clipping now when she had posed for magazines before, essentially saying **"she was asking for it."** 
This double standard highlights their biased agenda against celebrating women's autonomy over their own bodies and careers. In contrast, other reputed publications like The Hindu and Youth Ki Awaaz provided balanced, well-reasoned perspectives on the issue.

## Excessive Focus on Sensationalism 
It is obvious from ToI's social media approach that they prioritize garnering readership through provocative headlines over verified reporting. As seen in the seven consecutive posts about Aamir Khan, they seem more fixated on repetitive posting to hold attention instead of depth or accuracy of information.
### Irrelevance of Some Content
Some of their articles have nothing to do with genuine news reporting, like the one criticizing Deepika Padukone's choice of attire in response to her statements on objectification in the film industry. Including such irrelevant opinion pieces dilutes their credibility as a serious news source.
## Over-Reliance on Advertisements
The excessive advertisements filling ToI's print pages indicate their primary focus is monetizing readership instead of quality journalism. While ads are inevitable for newspapers, reputed publications like The Hindu manage to report accurately without being overly commercialized. 
## Superior Language and Standards at The Hindu 
As evident from sample articles shared, The Hindu exhibits much clearer writing standards with well-edited, unbiased reporting. The comparison of headlines about the theater incident showcases their objective tone versus ToI's inclination for controversy-baiting headlines.
Overall, The Times of India seems dangerously biased towards hype and hyperbole over verified facts. Serious readers are better served by trusting established brands like The Hindu or specialized sites like Youth Ki Awaaz for reliable, ad-free news and analysis.
