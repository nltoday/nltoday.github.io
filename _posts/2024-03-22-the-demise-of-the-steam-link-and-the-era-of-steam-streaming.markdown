### Streaming to TV Made Easy
Valve's Steam Link was a small device that allowed users to easily stream their Steam gaming library from their PC to their TV. By connecting to the home network via Ethernet or WiFi and displaying the streaming Steam client on the TV, users were treated to low latency gameplay and a quality experience above expectations. 
The key feature that set Steam Link apart was its ability to plug in various USB peripherals like gamepads, keyboards and mice. This allowed for full control of the streamed Steam games and desktop directly from the comfort of the couch. With response times almost on par with direct connections, Steam Link proved itself as a [wireless HDMI cable](https://store.fi.io.vn/work-hard-so-my-st-bernard-live-a-better-dog-lover-2) for big screen gaming.

### Software Takes Over Hardware
However, over time software alternatives began to weaken the value proposition of dedicated streaming hardware. Newer smart TV models from Samsung, LG and others added built-in support for **Steam Link app streaming**. This eliminated the need for an extra device sitting between the TV and router. 
Valve also ported their streaming client to Android phones, providing big screen options beyond just the television. The expanded availability of streaming through existing devices cut into Steam Link sales volumes. By late 2018, Valve slashed prices to just a few dollars trying to clear remaining stock.
### Warehousing Costs Propelled Discontinuation  
Valve's decision to discontinue Steam Link came down to simple economics. With software replacing hardware for streaming, demand had dried up for the dedicated box. Continued warehousing of unused inventory was an unnecessary expense that provided no revenue.
Selling off the last units for fractions of the original MSRP helped recoup some costs. But Valve realized it was more beneficial to fully eliminate overheads from stockpiling unneeded hardware. Reclaiming precious warehouse space for other profitable ventures made financial sense.
### The Future of Game Streaming is Software-Defined
Valve's shift away from Steam Link hardware to software-only streaming validated the transition underway across the industry. Nvidia, Google, Microsoft and others are **investing heavily in game streaming platforms** that treat games as services delivered over the internet, rather than products shipped on discs or downloaded.
Low latency 5G networks will make streaming games seamlessly to any screen a reality worldwide in the coming years. With software clients already available on most devices, there will be little need for separate streaming boxes. The future of playing PC games on the big screen lies in versatile, subscription-based streaming accessible from anywhere.
### Steam Link Paved the Way for Mainstream Game Streaming 
While its commercial run was short-lived, Steam Link deserves recognition as a pioneering product. It helped validate game streaming as a viable way to enjoy titles beyond just the desktop. The seamless integration of Steam's software suite showed how streaming could achieve parity with local hardware in terms of control flexibility and responsiveness. 
By making game streaming approachable and affordable through an simple plug-and-play box, Steam Link laid important groundwork. It helped transition the concept from niche appeal to mainstream awareness. Many modern streaming services that are reshaping how we play owe some debt to the proof-of-concept delivered by Valve's intrepid little Link box. Though the product was short-lived, its influence will endure as streaming becomes the dominant model.
### The Rise of VR Drove Resources from Steam Link
With game streaming poised to grow exponentially, Valve had good reason to shift focus away from ancillary hardware. Their next major push is into virtual reality with the Valve Index and Half-Life: Alyx. Producing and stocking high-end VR gear demands extensive manufacturing and logistics support that occupied space once used for Steam Link inventory. 
Selling off the remaining Steam Links let Valve recoup costs and fully reallocate entire warehouses to meeting surging demand for Index VR kits and components. For a company making ambitious plays in VR and game subscription platforms, dedicating resources to an unneeded product was impractical. While disappointing some early adopters, discontinuing Steam Link was a sound strategic move for Valve's long-term priorities in PC and VR gaming.
### Legacy of Accessibility and Simplicity
While technology marches ever onwards, the Steam Link deserves recognition for how it helped more gamers experience the joys of big screen play. In an era where PC exclusives were seen as too complex for consoles and TVs, Steam Link brought frills-free streaming to the masses. 
Its affordable price and plug-n-play design cut through perceptions of gaming PCs as complicated or restrictive. By making living room play as intuitive as kicking back with a controller, Steam Link grew the audience for Steam itself in a quintessential Valve style. Though the device was short-lived, its spirit of accessibility lives on in today's robust streaming services that continue broadening gaming's reach.
