### Discovering an Attachment  
As a child, I struggled with bedwetting issues until I was 10 years old. During that time, I developed an emotional attachment to Pull-Ups diapers and would often wear my wet diaper throughout the morning. While the bedwetting stopped around age 10, I occasionally purchased packs of Pull-Ups for myself over the next few years.

### Exploring Diaper Preferences
By senior year of high school, I began ordering higher-quality adult diapers and found myself preferring to wear them during my free time at home rather than typical underwear. I enjoyed the comfort and security of diapers while relaxing and playing [video games](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/alegre). Even after graduating, diapers became my go-to choice for everyday use.
### Finding Inspiration from a Sibling
Seeing my twin brother, who has developmental issues and relies on diapers, made me curious to experience wearing them again at age 10. With some effort, I began intentionally wetting the bed so my mom would diaper me like my brother. Within a few months, I started having daytime accidents as well and my mom kept me in diapers full-time for a while. 
### Continuing the Lifestyle into Adulthood   
Now at 19, I have chosen to remain in diapers 24/7 with my mom's support by purchasing supplies. While she no longer changes me, she accepts and enables my **diaper dependency** preference. Living as a fully diapered adult brings me feelings of comfort, relaxation and pleasure that I have not found through typical underwear wear.
### Supporting a Sister through Bladder Issues
When my younger sister developed severe bladder problems at age 13, our family rallied around her need for diapers. Witnessing her struggles and the familial acceptance made me comfortable sharing my own diaper interests. At 18, I began experimenting with adult diapers and quickly rediscovered how much I enjoyed wearing them each day.
### Embracing an Alternative Lifestyle  
It has now been a few years of daily diaper use for me. Thanks to being homeschooled, I avoided bullying and was free to openly explore this lifestyle. Wearing diapers brings me joy, relaxation and comfort that normal underwear does not. While not a conventional choice, living as a **fully diaper-dependent adult** feels right for me and my family fully accepts my atypical needs. My preference is to keep wearing diapers for the long term future.
### Finding Online Community and Information
To better understand myself and connect with others, I have sought out online communities for **diaper lovers**. Reading personal stories and gaining knowledge has helped me feel less alone. I especially appreciate forums discussing the practical aspects of long term diaper wear, such as skin care, managing odor and choosing quality supplies. Knowing there is a support network of people living similarly gives me confidence in my choices.
