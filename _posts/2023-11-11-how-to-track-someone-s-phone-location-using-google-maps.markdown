## Track a Phone on Google Maps Using Location History
Google Location History tracks a device's location over time and displays it on a map. This feature allows you to see where someone has been in the past if they have a Google account logged in on their phone. 
Anyone with access to the target person's Google account can view their Location History information. To do so, simply log into their Google account on a browser and head to [maps.google.com/locationhistory](http://maps.google.com/locationhistory). This will show a timeline of places they've visited. You can see the exact addresses and get an idea of their typical routes and locations.
Location History data is only available if the target person has the feature enabled on their Google account. Many people opt-out of Location History for privacy reasons. So there's no guarantee you'll be able to view past locations using this method.
### Leverage Third-Party GPS Tracking Apps 
If Location History doesn't provide the needed information, third-party GPS tracking apps can be utilized. These apps work by using the phone's GPS signal to monitor its real-time location. Install the app on the target phone, and you'll be able to view their location on a map. 
[CelTrackr](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/aliff) and **GPS Phone Tracker** are two reliable apps that offer free trials. They allow discreetly monitoring someone's whereabouts without them knowing. The apps hide their icons and send location updates silently to the monitoring user. 
GPS tracking apps require installing software on the target device. So this method only works if you have physical access to the phone. It's best to get consent before installing tracking apps due to privacy and legal issues.

## Leverage Google Maps Location Sharing 
Google Maps' location sharing allows approved contacts to view each other's real-time location on a map. For this to work, location sharing must be enabled on both phones.
To share a location:
1. Open the Maps app and tap the profile icon 
2. Select "Location sharing" 
3. Choose who you want to share with from your contacts
The contact will receive a link to view your location for 24 hours. Simply send them the link via call, text or other messaging apps. They can then see your live movements within Google Maps.
Location sharing provides an easy way to discreetly track another phone that gives consent. Just be sure to get permission from the person first due to privacy and safety issues.
### Use Find My Device for Android Tracking
If the target phone is an Android device, Google's Find My Device feature lets approved users remotely locate, ring, lock or erase lost Android phones. Both the target phone and login Google account need to have Find My Device enabled.
To initiate a search: 
1. Log into [www.google.com/android/find](http://www.google.com/android/find) using the target Google account  
2. Select the Android device you want to locate
3. Choose an option like "Play Sound", "Secure" or "Erase" to take action
Find My Device shows the device's **approximate location** in real-time. While it allows discreet monitoring of an Android phone, only enable it with the user's permission to avoid privacy breaches.
## Track iPhone Location using Siri Voice Commands
Siri voice commands offer a contactless way to locate and take action on any iOS device via voice interaction. To use this approach, the device owner needs to have allowed access through Siri. 
Say "Hey Siri, find my iPhone" to initiate a search on another signed-in Apple device. Siri will then provide the target iPhone's approximate location and options to "Play Sound", "Lost Mode" or "Erase" the device remotely.
By commanding "Hey Siri, is this my iPhone?" you can check if a found iPhone belongs to you or someone else. This serves as a discovery option if one misplaces their iPhone. 
While Siri tracking can aid iPhone location discreetly, privacy and consent is important. Inform the device owner and get their permission before using Siri to monitor their location via another Apple product.
## Conclusion
Whether someone wants to discreetly track a partner, child or employee, doing so requires understanding privacy laws and getting consent. The above options provide legal and ethical means to locate phones using Google and Apple services, given both parties cooperate. Always prioritize safety, transparency and consent over surveillance when using location tracking features.
