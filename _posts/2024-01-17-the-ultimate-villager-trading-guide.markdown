### Zombifying Villagers for Desired Trades
Villager zombie conversion, or "zombification," allows players to manipulate villager trades for the most profitable outcomes. By infecting and then curing villagers using potions and golden apples, their profession and trade prices can be randomly altered. The key is to zap villagers multiple times until achieving coveted 1-emerald book or diamond trades. One effective method is building an **"zombifier"** with splash potions that can convert 6 villagers simultaneously, repeating the process until getting 75% mortality for sought-after deals. Another option is linking a **"zombifier"** to an **infinite villager breeder** to continuously cycle new villagers. With persistence, every **efficiency 5, looting 3,** and **unbreaking 3 book** can be had for just 1 emerald each using these zombie "re rolls".
### Identifying the Most Lucrative Professions 
While all villager jobs provide some value, certain occupations yield far greater rewards with little effort. **Librarians** handing out 1-emerald book trades become the backbone of any **enchanting business**. **Toolsmiths, weaponsmiths,** and **armorer** villagers also offer 1-emerald diamond tools, weapons, and full armor sets respectively. However, the true kings of emerald farming are **cartographers** and their ludicrous 10-glass-panes-for-1-emerald barter. Obtaining over 150 emeralds in under 15 minutes by mining sand and fueling furnaces, cartographers enable lightning-fast currency accrual for any trading endeavors.
### Building an Automated Emerald Farm
To derive endless benefit from elite villager professions, an automated **trading hall** facilitates swift, hands-free gem generation. First, trap desired specialists using beds, workstations, and **fall-damage-proof containment.** Then, funnel zombies into a killing chamber linked to a **villager sensor** controlling iron doors. This maintains constant population while preserving valuable residents. Next, construct a central trading area surrounded by **lecterns, crafting tables etc**, and **line the floor with hopper minecarts** collecting dropped items. Finally, link the collection system to chests managed by a **sweeping system** that deposits payment and restocks fuel/materials as needed. With the push of a button, AFK overnight to amass diamonds, emeralds, and enchanted books beyond need!  
### Expanding Output and Maximizing Profits
For ultra high volume trading, expand your hub using **villager cloning** methods. With alectern, piston, minecart setup, endless copiescan bemade of your rare starters. Just save optimal individuals beforehand. Next, outfit hall space expeditiously using **villager eggs** spawned from charged creepers. Then, further expedite sales using **automatic restocking contraptions**. For example, refill lectern books using a **dispenser and observer loop** sensing stock levels. Additionally, automate **material collection and delivery systems** to make the most of each trade. For instance, transporting sand from nearby deserts directly to furnace rooms. With careful planning and redstone, one person setup can deliver the outputs of an entire marketplace or more!
### Sustaining the System Long-Term
To ensure endless profits, some maintenanceis required. First, build **chunk loaders** to keep all mechanisms running when AFK. Next, institute **trading Cool-downs** by item type or villager using timers so prices don'tinflateexcessively. Redstone contraptions can help here too. It's also wise to build in backup systems incasesomething fails or villagers despawn. For example, **alternative villager egg incubation and cloning rooms**. Finally, constructsorting and storagefor all outputs with easy retrieval access. With these sustaining elements inplace, your **fully self-sufficient villager empire** will produce wealth and resources forever!
