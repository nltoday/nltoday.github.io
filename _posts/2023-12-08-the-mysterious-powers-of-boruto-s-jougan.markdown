### Boruto's Special Dojutsu
Boruto's [Jougan celestial dojutsu](https://store.fi.io.vn/los-angeles-best-mom-best-mom-mothers-day-los-angeles-city645-t-shirt) has appeared in mysterious circumstances throughout the series. Its first activation was against Kawaki in episode 1 when Boruto saw his **future vision** of the destruction of Konoha. Since then, it has continued to manifest against powerful Otsutsuki clan members like Momoshiki and Urashiki.

### Patterns of Appearance  
A pattern emerges when analyzing the situations where Boruto's Jougan has activated. The eye seems to only appear when Boruto is facing an **Otsutsuki clan member** in battle. Its second activation was against the mysterious dimension-crossing beast Nue. Toneri and Sasuke later confirmed that Nue's dimension was **close to Kaguya's dimension**, suggesting the presence of an Otsutsuki drew out the Jougan.  
### Tracing Back to Kaguya
Boruto's Jougan may in fact be tied directly to the **Otsutsuki princess Kaguya**. Naruto inherited Hagoromo's Six Paths powers, while Hinata inherited Hamura's chakra through her Hyuga bloodline. If one were to combine the chakras of Hagoromo and Hamura, it would result in Kaguya's own power. In the same way, combining Naruto and Hinata's inherited powers could produce a dojutsu like the Jougan, directly tracing back to Kaguya.
### The Power to Predict Portals   
One known ability of Boruto's Jougan is its power to perceive chakra and potentially predict events. During Boruto's battle with the Otsutsuki Urashiki, the Jougan allowed him to sense and track Urashiki's space-time ninjutsu portals. This predictive ability gave Boruto the edge against Urashiki's dimension-crossing techniques.
### Further Revelations Ahead
With the looming threat of the Otsutsuki clan member Isshiki, the manga presents a prime opportunity for Boruto's Jougan to reappear. As the eye has only activated against Otsutsuki so far, its manifestation against Isshiki seems all but guaranteed. Future manga arcs may finally reveal more of the Jougan's full range of powers and abilities against the most powerful foes.
### A Celestial Dojutsu's Destiny  
In conclusion, Boruto's Jougan appears to be one of the most **celestial dojutsu** ever witnessed, tracing directly back to Kaguya Otsutsuki herself. While Boruto has yet to fully master its use, the eye's appearances thus far suggest it is destined to play a key role in the coming battles against the Otsutsuki invasion. With more opportunities to manifest on the horizon, Boruto's Jougan may soon unlock powers far beyond any sharingan or byakugan seen before. Its true potential and purpose may at last be revealed.
