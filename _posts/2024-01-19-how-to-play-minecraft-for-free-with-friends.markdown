### # Creating an Account 
Once TLauncher is installed, you will need to create an account. Open TLauncher and click on 'Create New Account'. Enter your desired username, email address and password. 
### # Installing Java (if needed)
Minecraft requires Java to run. Check if you have the latest version of Java installed by opening TLauncher and clicking on 'Settings'. If an older version is detected, you will be prompted to download and install the latest Java version.
### # Selecting the Game Version
With TLauncher set up, click on 'Play' and select the latest version of Minecraft from the options. As of writing, the latest version is **`1.19.2`**. Click download to get the game files.
## Playing with Friends
### # Creating a Minecraft Server
To play with friends, you will need a server. Head to `www.aternos.org` to create a free server. Sign up, name your server and click 'Start'.
### # Finding the Server IP 
Once started, Aternos will display your server's IP address. This IP needs to be shared with friends so they can connect. You may need to copy the IP from the website.
### # Joining from Multiplayer
Open Minecraft from TLauncher. Click on 'Multiplayer' and enter the server IP and port displayed on Aternos. Click 'Join Server' to connect! 
### # Inviting Friends
Ask your friends to download TLauncher and install Java if needed. Share your server IP so they can join from the multiplayer menu as well!
## Alternative Options
While TLauncher allows free play, there are some limitations to [cracked servers](https://store.fi.io.vn/i-am-your-friend-your-partner-your-beauceron-dog-mom-dad-1). If you wish to play on official servers or with friends who own the full game, these options may work better:
### # Minecraft Gift Cards
Purchase Minecraft gift cards to redeem a code for the Java/Bedrock edition of the game. Gift cards are available from $15-30 at major retailers.
### # Win a Free Code
Keep an eye out for Minecraft giveaways on websites, YouTube and social media. Participating greatly increases your chances of winning a free game code.
### # Earn Money Online
With a little effort, you can earn money through online tasks like surveys, mystery shopping and content creation. Save up enough to purchase Minecraft legitimately.
So in summary, TLauncher is a perfect free solution for playing Minecraft with friends. Just be aware of server restrictions. Alternative options exist if you want a fully-featured legit experience.
