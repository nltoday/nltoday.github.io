There has been a long-standing debate about the validity and meaning of operations involving zero, such as division by zero and multiplication by zero. Let us delve deeper into the rationale behind calling division by zero undefined while defining multiplication by zero to be zero. 
### Understanding the Relationship Between Multiplication and Division
Multiplication and division are inverse operations - for any two numbers a and b, if we multiply them we get a product c, and if we divide c by b we should get back a. For example, 6 × 3 = 18, and 18 ÷ 3 = 6. 
This inverse relationship only holds true when b is not equal to zero. If we try to apply the same logic to 1 ÷ 0, we run into issues. There is no single number c such that 1 = 0 × c. While 0 × 1 = 0 follows the commutative property of multiplication.

### Making Sense of Division by Zero Intuitively 
To understand division by zero intuitively, think of dividing some objects between groups. If I have 6 cookies and divide them into groups of 2, there will be 3 groups. If I have 6 cookies and divide them between 1 person each, there will be 6 groups. However, if I were to divide 6 cookies between 0 people or 0 groups, it does not represent a meaningful real-world scenario. There is no sensible interpretation we can assign to how many 0-person groups we can make out of 6 cookies. This is why division by zero is considered undefined.
### Defining Multiplication by Zero Through Patterns
While division by zero lacks intuitive meaning, multiplication can still be defined for zero through observation of patterns. If having 2 dozen eggs gives 24 eggs, and 1 dozen gives 12 eggs, it logically follows that having 0 dozen eggs would give 0 eggs. Defining 0 × any number n as 0 respects the commutative and distributive properties of multiplication that hold for other numbers. Therefore, 0 × 1 = 0 × 1 = 0 is a valid and conventional definition, unlike division by zero. 
### Addressing the Frage About Arbitrariness 
Some may argue that defining multiplication by zero as zero is arbitrary and fallacious. However, it is not arbitrary but rather deliberately defined based on establishing logical consistency with the known behaviors and properties of multiplication. Unlike division by zero, multiplication by zero can be given meaning by relating it to concrete real-world examples and embedding it within the mathematical structure of multiplication as an operation. Therefore, while division by zero is considered undefined and an error, the definition of multiplication by zero as zero is valid and non-fallacious.
### Understanding the Divergence Between Multiplication and Division
While multiplication and division are inverse operations for non-zero numbers, they are not perfectly symmetrical and can diverge in their behaviors and properties regarding zero. Division is non-commutative unlike multiplication, so order matters. This already shows division and multiplication are not identical matematical concepts. Most importantly, only multiplication can be meaningfully defined for zero in a way that naturally extends from its definition for non-zero numbers. Division by zero lacks any such sensible definition extending intuition and patterns established for non-zero numbers. This divergence is the key rationale behind labeling division by zero as undefined, not multiplication by zero.
### Refuting Claims of Arbitrariness and Fallacy 
In summary, defining multiplication by zero as zero is not a fallacious or arbitrary convention, but a mathematically logical choice that respects known properties of multiplication and extends them consistently to include zero. On the other hand, division by zero cannot be intuitively interpreted or defined as a natural extension of division for non-zero numbers the way multiplication of zero can. Claims that establishing multiplication by zero = 0 while labeling division by zero as undefined are logically inconsistent overlook the divergence in behaviors of these two inverse but not identical operations regarding zero. While an interesting philosophical debate, mathematics favors clear, unambiguous definitions that align with logical deduction over arbitrary conventions.
### Conclusion on a Long-Running Debate 
This complex, nuanced issue around zero has fueled discussion among mathematicians and philosophers for centuries. By deeply examining the patterns, properties and intuitive interpretations behind these fundamental operations, we gain insight into why conventions differentiate multiplication and division of zero even though they are inverse functions. Rather than arbitrary decisions, these conventions aim to establish definitive, logically consistent definitions. Overall, a richer understanding of the mathematical structure and divergent behaviors involving zero helps resolve the debate over its definitions and seemingly contradictory treatment in different operations.
