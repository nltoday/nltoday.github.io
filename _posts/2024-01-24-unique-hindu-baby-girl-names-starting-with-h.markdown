Another name representing balance is Haith, meaning "who wants good for everyone". It shows a spirit of inclusion, positivity and wishing the best for all. Haituka translates to "well wisher", expressing care, compassion and good will towards others. These qualities cultivate **understanding and cooperation**. Names like Hardika ("full of love") and Hardini ("near of heart") signify affection, warmth and nurturing qualities essential for building strong communities. Choosing a name emphasizing balance, goodwill or care instills these virtues in your daughter from an early age.
