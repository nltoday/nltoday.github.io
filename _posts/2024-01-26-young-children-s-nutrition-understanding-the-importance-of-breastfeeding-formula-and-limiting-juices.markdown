## Starting Solids
Exclusive breastfeeding or formula is recommended until babies reach around 6 months of age. At this stage, babies are developmentally ready to start experimenting with solid foods. Starting solid foods, also known as complementary feeding, allows babies to explore new textures and flavors while still receiving most of their nutrition from breastmilk or formula. 
Some commonly introduced first solid foods include pureed fruits and vegetables. **Pureed baby foods** provide important nutrients while having a soft texture babies can easily handle. Good first fruits to introduce include apples, pears, bananas and avocados. Common first vegetables include sweet potatoes, carrots and butternut squash. Introducing a variety of healthy whole foods early on helps support balanced nutrition and healthy eating habits down the line.
## Limiting Juices Under One 
It's not recommended to offer **juice to babies under one year old**. Juice provides extra calories and sugar without the balanced nutrition found in breastmilk and formula. The **American Academy of Pediatrics** advises limiting juice intake for children under one to avoid issues like tooth decay and overweight. Whole fruits are a much better choice as they provide fiber which helps slow sugar absorption. 
For older babies just starting solids between 6-12 months, whole milk yogurt or pureed fruits mixed with a little breastmilk or formula make excellent alternatives to juice. These help transition babies to textured foods while still supporting healthy growth and development.
## Integrating Juice After One With Caution 
Around 12 months, if babies are eating well-rounded nutritious meals, limited 100% fruit juice in a sippy cup can be introduced. However, the **daily juice amount** should be no more than 4-6 ounces and offered only once per day, typically with lunch. Diluting juice with water cuts down on natural fruit sugars. Apple and pear juices are generally most suitable when first introducing juice as they are less acidic and lower in natural sugar than other fruits.  
Continuing breastfeeding or formula through the first birthday and beyond provides important protein, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants juice cannot substitute. Juice also lacks fiber for healthy digestion. For these reasons, whole fruits should make up the majority of a young child's fruit servings, with limited juice offered sparingly as a special treat rather than a meal replacement. Following guidelines on juice supports establishing healthy eating habits from an early age.
## Weaning From The Bottle
As babies near their first birthday, weaning from bottles or sippy cups containing breastmilk or formula to whole cows milk in a regular cup is an important developmental milestone. The **American Academy of Pediatrics** recommends **transitioning to whole milk** by age one for its increased calories and nutrients needed at this stage. 
Weaning needs to be done gradually to help babies adjust. For a few weeks, parents can offer some beverages from a cup and some from a bottle or sippy to get them used to both. Praise and positive reinforcement help the process. Once fully weaned, cows milk provides key nutrients like protein, calcium, vitamin D and B12 to support growth and brain development through toddlerhood into the preschool years.
## Maintaining Nutritious Habits
The first two years set the foundation for lifelong healthy eating patterns. By carefully following guidelines around breastfeeding, formula, limiting juices and gradually introducing solids, parents give their little ones the best possible nutrition toolbox. Continuing to serve a variety of nutrient-dense whole foods like proteins, fruits and vegetables helps toddlers expand their palates naturally. Positive mealtime environments help establish nutritious habits young children will hopefully carry well into their futures.
