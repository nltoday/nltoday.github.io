Living with a narcissist often follows a predictable cycle of idealization, devaluation and discard. While the abuse takes a huge toll on the victim's well-being, the narcissist simply moves on to their next source of supply without looking back. This extensive article explores the different stages of narcissistic abuse in depth.
## Getting Reeled In
An [narcissistic abuse victim](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/aldrete) is carefully selected by the narcissist based on desirable traits like attractiveness, confidence and resources that can be exploited. The narcissist puts their target on a pedestal from the very beginning with lavish **love bombing** and future faking about forever commitments. They present an idealized image of who they want their victim to believe they are. However, this idealization phase is short-lived once the victim is thoroughly trauma bonded.
## The Devaluation Begins
Once the victim is emotionally entangled and dependent, the narcissist's true colors start showing through. **Criticism, gaslighting and controlling behavior** gradually erode the victim's sense of self-worth. Any dissent is punished with **silent treatment, accusations or rage**. The victim walks on eggshells trying to anticipate and please their abuser's volatile moods. Nothing is ever good enough for the narcissist, whose only goal is to assert total power and obedience. 
### Breaking Them Down
As the months or years pass, the accumulated abuse takes a massive psychological toll. With their confidence shattered through constant **berating, manipulation and isolation**, most victims have become shells of their former selves by this point. The once proud, successful individuals are now completely dependent on their abuser for any sense of worth or purpose. This leaves them extremely vulnerable to further mistreatment with no will left to escape.

### Mirroring Their Darkness  
A narcissist despises seeing their own flaws reflected back at them. So they deliberately degrade their victim into a state where they mirror the narcissist's own inner darkness and deficiencies. Having pulverized the vibrant person they originally coveted, the victim's shattered remains serve as a living reminder of the narcissist's perceived inferiority that they constantly try to overcompensate for.
## The Discard
When the victim has been completely broken down and their usefulness expires, the final destructive stage begins. The narcissist suddenly withdraws all forms of **love, attention and financial support** without explanation. They may even **physically attack or falsely accuse** their former victim during the discard phase in order to inflict maximum trauma. The vicious exit is designed to utterly destroy any remaining traces of the victim's identity or dignity.
### No Closure or Compassion
A discarded victim is left reeling with no understanding of what just happened. The narcissist feels no remorse or obligation to provide **closure, answers or even a simple goodbye**. They have already moved on to **idealizing their next source of supply** and will quickly rewrite the past to paint themselves as the true victims. Any pain inflicted is completely disregarded since the narcissist is incapable of real empathy or attachment.
### Paralyzing Heartbreak 
For most survivors, the trauma of being so callously cast away by someone they loved and devoted themselves to for years can be psychologically paralyzing. Without the support system eroded by their abuser, victims often struggle with **severe depression, PTSD, trust issues and suicidal thoughts** in the aftermath of these toxic relationships. It can take considerable time, therapy and healing to start rebuilding from such profound damage.
## The Cycle Repeats Itself
A narcissist's relentless need for adulation and control ensures the destructive pattern will continue with future partners. Traits they once **idealized as desirable targets** become glaring flaws to be attacked once real attachment sets in. And so the cycle of idealize, devalue and discard spins on, leaving a long trail of devastated lives in its wake until the narcissist faces real consequences or commits to personal growth. For the victims, breaking free of trauma bonds and regaining self-worth is a difficult but important step towards preventing further abuse.
