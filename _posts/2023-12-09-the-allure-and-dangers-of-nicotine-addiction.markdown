### The Urge to Try  
As a curious 14-year-old, the desire to experiment is natural. Vaping seems intriguing, unlike the dangers highlighted by warnings.

Vaping provides a smooth, odorless nicotine hit unlike smoking’s harshness. For newcomers, this stealthy method evades detection.

Addiction steals life’s opportunities while trapping one in a living nightmare impossible to escape alone.
