## Choosing the Right Messaging Service
Smartphones have made it incredibly easy to share photos and videos between friends and family. However, choosing the right messaging service is important to ensure high quality content is delivered between iPhone and Android devices. 
### Compression Issues with MMS
Even using multimedia messaging service (MMS), photos sent from an iPhone will appear much more blurry than ones sent from an Android device. [Apple is known to heavily compress images sent via MMS](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-xmas-lighting-matching-ugly-chihuahua-dog-christmas-81-chihuahua-dog), purposefully lowering the quality to reduce file sizes. While MMS was designed for simple photo sharing, it isn't the best option if quality is a priority.

### Internet-Based Chat Apps Prevent Degradation
Sending photos or videos over cellular networks using MMS or SMS will always result in compression by carriers trying to minimize data usage on their networks. For the highest quality, **Internet-based chat apps like Google Hangouts avoid this issue.** As they transmit files over WiFi or mobile data instead of SMS/MMS protocols, content remains uncompressed.
## Leveraging Services Like Google Photos  
Google Photos provides a seamless solution for sharing files between any devices. By uploading images and videos to the cloud, users can easily send sharing links instead of direct attachments. **The "Google Photos" approach ensures files are of publishing quality regardless of the recipient's platform.** It also has the advantage of not being bound by the size limits of MMS.
### Using Google Hangouts for Chat Functionality
For a combined chat and sharing experience, Google Hangouts incorporates the above Google Photos approach. Files can be sent within the Hangouts conversation interface by pasting sharing links. And as an Internet-based service, **there is no degradation from compression.** Hangouts has cross-platform compatibility without requiring the recipient to have a Google account.
## Apple's iMessage Keeps Quality High for iPhone Users
While third party apps provide cross-compatibility, Apple has its own solution optimized for iPhone users - iMessage. Leveraging Internet connectivity instead of cellular networks, iMessage allows seamless high-fidelity sharing between devices. **This "iMessage" experience is only possible between two Apple products however.**
### Downsides of Relying on iMessage Exclusively  
Solely using iMessage means iPhone owners can only maintain quality when communicating with other iPhone owners. **Content is compressed for Android recipients.** It also makes sharing inconvenient outside one's iOS user bubble. Rather than platform lock-in, multi-platform services tend to be more versatile solutions.
## Combining the Best of Both Worlds
An ideal approach combinesApple and third party offerings - leveraging each where they excel. For communication between iPhones, take advantage of iMessage. But also have apps like Google Photos, Hangouts or WhatsApp installed for seamless cross-compatibility. **By "combining capabilities", users get high quality within iOS networks plus versatility beyond.** This ensures the best experience regardless of a contact's device preferences.
In summary, Internet-based apps prevent the degradation caused by traditional messaging protocols. Services like Google Photos complement platform-specific solutions. And with a multi-pronged strategy, users can leverage each method for maximum sharing effectiveness across iOS and Android.
