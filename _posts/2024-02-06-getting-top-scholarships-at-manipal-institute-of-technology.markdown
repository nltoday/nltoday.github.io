## The Scholarships available
Scholarships are available at MIT for deserving students based on their performance in MUOET. There are two main types of scholarships - [freeships](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/alkire) and **merit-cum-means scholarships**. 
### Freeships
Freeships provide 100% waiver of tuition fees and are awarded to the top 100 ranking students in MUOET. To be eligible, one must score at least 165 marks which typically corresponds to a rank of 100 or below. ***While tuition fees are fully waived***, students still need to pay hostel and mess fees which range from Rs. 90,000 to Rs. 1.8 lakh per year depending on the type of accommodation chosen.

### Merit-cum-means scholarships   
Merit-cum-means scholarships provide partial fee waivers ranging from 10% to 100% based on one's family income and MUOET rank. One needs a minimum score of 155 marks or a rank between 101-1000 to be eligible. The percentage of fee waiver depends on the annual parental income. Hostel fees still need to be paid by the student.
## Applying for scholarships
To apply for scholarships at MIT, one must take admission after qualifying in MUOET, the entrance exam for MIT. The official MIT website provides detailed information on the eligibility criteria and required documents for **different scholarship programs**. It is important to check the scholarship webpage and application deadlines.
### Important dates and documents
Some key dates and documents required include passing MUOET with the required rank/marks, duly filled application form, ***income certificate***, birth certificate, marksheets of class 10th and 12th, gap/work experience certificates if any. Most deadlines are in June/July so it is best to apply immediately after MUOET results are out.
## Financial benefits and obligations
While **freeships provide 100% tuition fee waiver**, merit scholarships waive only a percentage ranging from 10% to maximum 100% based on rank and income. However, neither type waives hostel and mess fees which are mandatory. Typical hostel fees range anywhere between Rs. 90,000 to 1,80,000 per year. 
### Calculating savings
For example, for a student with 100% **merit scholarship** and parental income of Rs. 5 lakhs annually, the tuition fee savings would be around Rs. 14.5 lakhs for the full 4-year program. After deducting hostel fees of say Rs. 1 lakh per year, the total savings would be huge. It is thus important for deserving candidates to apply on time.
## Maintaining eligibility
Once admitted with a scholarship, students need to maintain certain academic standards to continue receiving the benefits. Typically a **minimum CGPA of 7.5** is required to be eligible each year. Scholarships may be revoked if the student's performance drops or they are involved in any misconduct. It is important students make the most of this opportunity and give their best.
## Stories of successful scholars
Every year many **deserving candidates** manage to get top ranks in MUOET and secure 100% scholarships at MIT. Some notable examples are Student A who scored 167 and is now in her final year pursing computer science. Student B scored 161 and is currently interning with a leading technology company in Bangalore. Their stories show with determination and focus, anyone can achieve their dreams even without having to burden their families financially.
## Conclusion
Top scholarships like freeships and merit-cum-means provide a huge financial benefit and opportunity to study at one of India's best technological institutes like MIT. Candidates must work hard for MUOET, apply on time with required documents, and maintain grades to continue availing these benefits throughout their program. With the right effort, they can complete their degree debt-free and have a bright future ahead.
