The isDone.dll error commonly occurs when installing large games or software packages on Windows devices. This error message typically displays as "An error occurred when unpacking! unarc.dll returned an error code: -1 ERROR: archive data corrupted (decompression fails)." 
The root causes can be insufficient system resources like RAM or storage space, corrupted system files, antivirus interference, or incompatibilities between the software/game requirements and the PC's specifications. Proper troubleshooting requires identifying the true cause behind the error.
### Checking Minimum Requirements
One of the first things to check is if the PC meets the minimum specs listed by the developer. Every game/software lists hardware and software requirements that must be met. Take just a few minutes to do a quick search of "[Game/Software Name] Minimum System Requirements" and compare it to your PC configuration. Inadequate RAM, graphics card, storage space or other components can cause the isDone.dll error. Upgrading or freeing up resources may solve it.

### Increasing Virtual Memory 
Insufficient RAM is a common culprit. Windows uses page file or virtual memory stored on the hard disk to handle processes that exceed physical RAM capacity. Increasing virtual memory allocation can provide the extra "RAM" needed. Follow simple steps to manually configure larger initial and maximum page file sizes, say 400MB and 3000MB. This provides a temporary 3GB RAM boost that may help installations complete smoothly.
### Disabling Antivirus Programs  
Some antivirus software incorrectly identifies game installation files as threats and removes or quarantines them, resulting in the isDone.dll error. Try completely disabling the antivirus and any third-party security programs as a test. If the installation succeeds, the antivirus was likely interfering. Adding exceptions for trusted games/software can prevent future issues.
### Checking and Replacing System Files
Corrupted or missing system files required by the installer can trigger the error. Use the System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tools from an administrative command prompt to scan for and repair any Windows file issues. Replacing files like isDone.dll and unArc.dll with fresh copies may also resolve it if they are corrupted.
### Defragmenting Drives
Drive fragmentation occurs as files become scattered on the disk, affecting performance. A fragmented drive can cause the isDone.dll error during large installations. Use the in-built Disk Defragmenter tool or a third-party equivalent to optimize fragmented drives, particularly the drive with the lowest free space. This consolidates files and may provide the extra room needed.
