## Surviving in Cities After 2 Years
The cities may seem like the worst place to go at the start of a zombie outbreak. However, after a couple years have passed, they could become relatively safe havens. By that point, any remaining zombies would have wandered away from the dense urban areas in search of targets. 
**While the advent of solar-powered smart homes means renewable energy sources might still function, long-term food and material scavenging may prove difficult amid the rubble.** Survival would require clearing buildings methodically and cooperating with any other survivors encountered. Going it alone risks drawing unwanted attention from stray creatures lurking in the shadows. 
## Thriving Off-Grid at an Amazon Fulfillment Center 
Isolated Amazon warehouses lying within a day's travel outside major population centers offer **ample stockpiles of non-perishables, medical supplies, and tools.** Solar panels could keep essential systems running, while strong perimeter fencing deters trespassers living and undead. 
**Abundant pallets of canned goods, dry goods, and first aid kits mean one need not worry about finding sustenance for months.** Power tools, construction materials, and vehicles on-site assist long-term settlement establishment. Internal security systems may even help monitor exterior activity and detect incoming threats. 
Though isolated, the fulfillment center sits near enough major transportation routes to facilitate future expeditions elsewhere. With practice, its expansive ceilings and empty bays could host small farming and livestock operations to transition to self-sufficiency.
### Embarking on a Self-Sufficient Voyage
Time aboard a seaworthy sailboat provides the ultimate zombie escape. **Solar arrays and hydrogenerators guarantee electricity for appliances, lights, water filtration, and communication gear.** With rain catchment and a small watermaker, fresh water remains accessible.
**Navigating toward unpopulated Arctic coasts allows landing to hunt or forage without fear of encounters.** Offshore fishing yields protein, while onboard greenhouse shelving grows herbs and leafy greens. Stopping at remote tropical islands permits harvesting native fruits and harvesting rain for storage.  
Navigation charts pinpoint the safest routes between landfalls, avoiding hot zones. A locker stocked with repair materials and tools keeps the vessel seaworthy. Regular maintenance and diligent lookouts continue to spot threats far in advance. After years adrift, one emerges prepared to homestead isolated shorelines.

### Establishing a Self-Sustaining Commune in the Countryside
Backwoods properties situated alongside natural freshwater sources and wooded hills offer defendable positions. **Abundant game, edible plants, and water accessibility ensure long-term diet self-reliance.** 
Solar arrays, wind turbines, and hydroelectric setups harness renewable power for lighting, farming technology, communications, and security systems. Greenhouses, fish farms, and livestock breeding ramp up agricultural output. Composting and gray water irrigation promote ecological stability.
Fortified facilities, established supply routes, and patrol schedules maintain security. **Recruiting capable survivors to the compound amplifies its labor force and skills pool.** Neighboring Communities may form mutual-aid pacts for resources and manpower during emergencies. Success attracts additional refugees seeking long-term asylum from surrounding hazards.
### Thriving within Inland Mountain Retreats 
Secluded alpine estates tucked within remote mountain valleys create naturally defensible redoubts. camera-equipped drones scout the perimeter while stay-behinds monitor activity through spotting scopes. High vantage points grant panoramic surveillance of approaches from afar.
Cold-weather crops such as potatoes, winter squash and cabbage as well as poultry and dairy livestock prove hardier against climactic extremes. **Greenhouse hydroponics and aquaponics optimize plant growth with renewable geothermal energy.** Rainwater catchment and wells access potable water. 
Hunting rifles and crossbows harvest wild game without disclosing the retreat's location. Cold storage preserves the bounty. During blizzards, fuelwood stockpiles and renewable power safeguard against weather-related outages. Defensive preparation deters unwelcome intrusions as help arrives infrequently.
### Reinforcing an Island Fortress
Remote islands lacking land bridges to the mainland offer maximum isolation. Survey teams scout suitable locations with natural deep-water moats, high cliff faces and rocky shores to repel swimmers and boats. 
Construction crews fortify the perimeter with reinforced sea walls, observation towers, anti-vehicle caltrops, and electrical fencing. **Harbor infrastructure includes nets to catch any floating invaders and scuttling mechanisms to sink breached boats.**
Desalination plants and catchment systems ensure long-term water self-reliance. Greenhouses, livestock, fish farms and beehives provide sustenance. Offshore fishing and scavenging expeditions resupply utilizing armored watercraft. Shipyards construct more seacraft to expand the island's footprint. 
Airfields and helipads accept supply planes and medevac vehicles. With its impregnable barriers and thriving economy, the island promises a secure future beyond the chaos afflicting the mainland. Regular patrols eliminate any encroaching threats to its autonomous society.
### Living among Protective Underground Communities  
Subterranean complexes offer maximum protection from surface dangers. Abandoned missile silos, carrier command centers and basement infrastructure house subterranean towns encased behind reinforced blast doors, barricades and security checkpoints.  
Powerful generators and renewable geothermal energy sustain hydroponic farms, aquaculture, food storage, water treatment and heated living quarters deep underground. Vertical farming optimizes limited floor space. Recycling systems minimize waste and resupply needs.
Tunnels connect safe houses and utilities throughout miles of subterrain. Patrols maintain tunnel integrity against ground collapse while monitoring security cameras for intruders. Above-ground lookouts spot incoming threats under nearby mountains and artificial sniper blinders.
Living underground remains unsustainable long-term without surface scavenging missions. A small settlement maintains multiple exit/entry points, transport vehicles, and scouts to replenish dwindling supplies until stability returns above ground. Underground defense proves fail-safe until that time.
