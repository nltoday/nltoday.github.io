## The Rise of Short Video Format
Short videos are becoming more and more popular among both younger and older generations due to their simple and engaging format. People are consuming a higher volume of content in shorter bursts throughout the day on their mobile devices. Instagram recognized this global trend and introduced Reels in 2020 to capitalize on it. 
### **Short-Form Content Creation**
Reels allows users to easily create and edit 15-second multi-clip videos set to music and audio. Creators can record videos, add visual filters and effects, record with music, and share reels to their feed, stories or explore page. This simple yet powerful creation process has lowered the barrier for users to become content creators.

Besides their feed, users can now spend a significant time browsing reels from accounts they don’t follow on the dedicated reels tab. This exposes creator’s content to a much wider audience and helps them gain new followers organically. Instagram promotes reels that garner more views and engagement to reach new users through the explore section.
## Leveraging Instagram Algorithm favorability
Instagram's powerful algorithm analyzes a user's account activity and favors those who engage with all Instagram features including reels. It recommends such active profiles to more users through various surfaces increasing their reach exponentially.
### **Active Engagement is the Key**  
Creators need to post reels regularly along with photos and stories to signal their commitment to the platform. The algorithm then returns the favor by featuring such content to their existing followers and new discoverable audiences. Posting at optimal times also boosts viewership.
### **Consistent Hashtag Usage**
Always include 2-5 relevant hashtags in the reels description. Popular hashtags related to the niche help the reel reach a broader set of users. Consistent usage of hashtags trains the algorithm to also suggest the creator's other content to users engaging with those hashtags.
## Boosting with Paid Services like Instagram Reels Likes
New creators can use paid promotional methods like buying reels likes organically to kickstart their reach until the content goes viral. 
### **Initial Kickstart for Reach**
Services provide 250-5000 genuine likes for $5-$50 which is way more cost effective than running ads. Even small like counts signal quality content to the algorithm for recommendation.
### **Gradual Authentic Growth** 
Unlike bots, these likes come from real engaged users over time ensuring safety from Instagram restrictions. The creator can continue creating better reels and growing follower base organically through the expanded initial reach.
## Consistent Quality Over Quantity
While frequent posting and viral tactics help boost reach initially, consistency matters the most for sustainable long term growth. 
### **Niche Relevant High Quality Content**
Creators should focus on their niche and post reels around the topics their ideal followers care about. Well filmed, edited and engaging reels keeping the latest trends in mind perform better.
### **Genuine Personality and Value**  
Shows that reflect the creator's authentic personality and provide value to the audience in an enjoyable way are more likely to cultivate loyal followers. Creators must listen to their community for feedback and ideas.
### **Community Engagement is Paramount**  
Creators must engage actively with their followers by replying to comments, running relevant polls and questions stickers. This cultivates a sense of belonging and inspires higher engagement driving the reels to more users organically.
In conclusion, by leveraging the algorithm favorability for Reels through regular posting and paid promotional tactics initially, creators can consistently expand their reach and grow loyal following organically by focusing on niche relevance, quality over quantity and community engagement. Reels provide an excellent platform for creators to showcase their skills and connect with new audiences worldwide.
