Cooking tender baby back ribs requires careful steps of preparation and cooking techniques to break down the connective tissues and produce fall-off-the-bone results. Here is an in-depth guide to achieve expertly prepared tender ribs every time.
## Preparing the Ribs
The key to tender ribs starts with preparing the meat properly before cooking. There are a few important steps to take.
### Removing the Membrane
[Remove membrane from baby back ribs](https://store.fi.io.vn/white-pomeranian-dog-weightlifting-in-cyber-fitness-gym-2) before cooking. Use a butter knife to lift a corner, then grab with paper towel and peel off completely. This allows ribs to absorb more flavor and cook evenly.

### Applying Dry Rub
Coat ribs generously with a homemade **dry rub seasoning** blend. Popular options include paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, brown sugar, salt, and pepper. The spices add flavor while helping to **tenderize meat** through the cooking process. 
### Pre-Cooking the Ribs
For extra tenderness, **pre-cook ribs using a low-temperature method**. Wrap tightly in foil and bake at 250째F for 2 to 2.5 hours. The low heat breaks down connective tissues over long hours for fall-off-the-bone results.
## Cooking Techniques
Various cooking methods can be applied to finish cooking the ribs to perfection.
### Oven Baking 
After pre-cooking, remove ribs from foil and coat both sides with BBQ sauce. Bake uncovered at 350째F, basting with more sauce halfway, for 20-30 minutes to caramelize the glaze. 
### Smoking
For smokey barbecue flavor, smoke ribs for 4-6 hours over indirect heat at 225-250째F until very tender. During final hour, glaze ribs and move directly over heat to caramelize.
### Grilling
Pre-cook as above then finish ribs on the grill. Direct or indirect cooking works; glaze ribs halfway through for a juicy, saucy finish. Watch closely to avoid burning.
## Ensuring Tenderness
A few final steps guarantee the ultimate tender texture. 
### Checking Internal Temperature
Use a meat thermometer to accurately check the ribs have reached a minimum **internal temperature of 190째F**. This confirms the collagen has fully broken down.
### Allowing to Rest
Let cooked ribs rest for 10 minutes before serving. This important step allows juices to reabsorb into the meat fibers, resulting in moist **fall-off-the-bone tenderness**. 
### Cutting and Serving
With a sharp knife, cut racks into individual ribs and arrange attractively on a platter. Provide toothpicks or small plates for easy eating. Enjoy!
