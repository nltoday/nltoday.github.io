YouTube has become one of the major platforms for content creators to share their passion and possibly earn some income. However, the reality of making money on the platform is quite different than what many imagine. In this article, I will break down the actual factors that determine YouTube earnings based on my own experience as a small creator.
### Views Matter More than Subscribers
When I first started my channel years ago, I was thrilled to gain new subscribers with each new video. However, it soon became clear that the subscriber count itself did little for my actual earnings. [YouTube ad revenue](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/aberle) is based on the number of views your videos receive from people watching advertisements, not your subscriber count. A video with 50,000 views will earn more than 10 videos with 100 views each, despite having fewer overall subscribers. Creators need to focus on creating quality, engaging content that keeps viewers watching for the full ad experience.

### The Elusive 'Viral' Video 
In the beginning, my channel was growing slowly with around 15-30 views per video and only $2 in total earnings after 2 years. Then I uploaded a video that unexpectedly took off, receiving over 60,000 views in just 2 weeks. This "viral" hit resulted in a big boost in subscribers to around 1,200 but, more importantly, $50 in ad revenue - a massive increase from my previous earnings. While exciting, such a breakout video is nearly impossible to plan or force. Creators need persistence and a bit of luck for their content to gain widespread traction.
### Consistency is Key for Steady Growth
After my initial spike from the viral video, I focused on regular uploads while maintaining video quality. Over the next 4 months, a few videos performed moderately well with 40,000, 30,000 and 15,000 views each. This more consistent upload schedule and view counts allowed me to gradually grow my subscriber base to 1,800 while earning around $80 total from YouTube at that point. Creators who want a steadier income should aim for healthy but predictable view counts across many videos rather than hoping for another viral hit. 
### Niche Targeting Brings Higher Earnings Potential
The types of ads that play on videos and the amount paid per view varies significantly based on the creator's niche or topic. For example, **gaming videos** often have lower paying ads compared to topics like **personal finance**. Researching popular and profitable niches can help optimize earnings potential over time. While I made decent money from my tutorial content, focusing on topics like **home DIY projects** or **small business advice** may have brought in even higher CPM rates per 1,000 views. Creators should strategically choose and develop niches with room for strong **monetization.**
### Building an Audience is a Marathon, Not a Sprint
When I hit around 1,800 subscribers, growth stalled as my average views decreased to only 150 per video. Earnings slowed to a trickle as well. It was disappointing to see results drop off after an initial surge. However, this experience highlights how the YouTube journey is a marathon rather than a sprint. Creators must remain steadfast through ups and downs, continuously testing ways to provide value while adapting to algorithm changes. Over several more years of uploading consistently, my channel now has healthy mid-five figure views per month - proof that persistence pays off for those committed to building their brand and community on the platform.
### Transparency is Key for Managing Expectations
In conclusion, the biggest lesson I've learned is that the pathway to success on YouTube is unpredictable and rarely straightforward. My goal with this article was to provide an honest look into my own experience to help new and aspiring creators better understand the realities of making a living from YouTube. Key performance indicators like view counts, not subscriber numbers, truly dictate earnings potential. Patience, strategy and a little luck are needed to see meaningful results. Above all, transparency around the ups and downs of the journey is important to set the right expectations for both yourself and your audience on the platform.
