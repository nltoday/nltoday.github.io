The National Hockey League (NHL) is considered the pinnacle of hockey careers. Every young player dreams of one day making it to "The Show" and playing in front of sold out arenas against the best players in the world. However, the route to get there is far from straightforward. In this article, we will explore the various avenues a player can take to eventually realise their dream of skating in the NHL.
### Drafted Players   
For the majority of future NHL players, their journey begins at the annual NHL Entry Draft. Each June, all [30 NHL franchises](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/dog-father) select from among the top prospects eligible for recruitment out of the junior, college and European leagues. Players between the ages of 18-20 years old are eligible to be selected. The order is determined by playoff results from the previous season, with non-playoff teams entering a weighted lottery to determine the top selections.
Being drafted is considered the most direct path to the NHL, as teams invest significant resources into their draft picks with the expectation they will someday play in the big league. First round picks especially receive exceptional scrutiny and development focuses from their new clubs. While not a guarantee, **drafted players have the highest statistical probability of eventually playing in the NHL** compared to other pathways. However, it still takes considerable improvement and performance at lower levels before earning a regular roster spot.

### Undrafted College Players   
Not every future NHL player hears their name called on draft day. A sizable portion are overlooked by all 30 teams for one reason or another. One common route for these undrafted prospects is playing NCAA Division 1 hockey through a four-year college career. Spending time developing against older competition helps refine their skills. And the college path allows them to continue showcasing against higher levels of talent each season.
Scouts from every NHL organization closely monitor the top performers in the NCAA ranks. Coming out of their college career, these overlooked talents will earn opportunities to prove themselves through training camp tryouts or minor league contracts. **Standout college players provide great late-round finds and free agent pickups for NHL clubs.** With further refinement in the minor leagues, these undrafted collegians can work their way up to eventually earning an NHL opportunity. Famously, players like Jimmy Howard, Andy McDonald and Brian Boyle all took this avenue to hockey's highest level.
### European Exodus  
In addition to North American junior and college paths, a growing number of promising prospects choose to develop their game in the professional leagues of Europe. Nations like Sweden, Finland and Russia feature highly competitive men's leagues that provide earlier testing against full grown opponents compared to North America's development systems.
The skilled players that stand out across the pond attract interest and later immigration to the NHL through the entry draft or as free agents. In recent years, **more than 20% of NHL rosters have included European-trained talents,** many of whom were overlooked or went undrafted from their domestic leagues. The transition requires an adjustment to the smaller ice surfaces and style of play in North America. But the leagues abroad serve as an effective proving ground en route to seeking an NHL career.
### Undrafted in North America
Some prospects are simply missed by all thirty NHL clubs entirely during their draft eligible years, whether due to relatively late blooming development curves or other circumstances. For these outliers, their only chance is securing an opportunity through professional tryouts once their junior or college eligibility expires. Impressing at training camps and in the minor leagues is their only ticket to gaining NHL consideration.
While certainly a longshot path, each season there are a few examples of players debuting in the league after paying their dues through other pro circuits. Most notably in recent years, Victor Arvidsson went completely undrafted before working his way up through the American and Swedish leagues to become a versatile top-six forward for Nashville. **Persistence and continuous improvements are key for the undrafted hoping to one day breakthrough to hockey's highest level.** With the right breakouts of skill and determination, the NHL remains open to those willing to challenge for roster spots through nontraditional avenues.
### European to North American
As the talent pool across European hockey continues expanding, there remains a steady stream of promising players choosing to test themselves by crossing the Atlantic Ocean to pursue the NHL dream. While drafted overseas, many elect to join North American major-junior leagues like the OHL in order to accelerate hone their game against peers their own age and to familiarize themselves with the continent.
These transfers provide another evaluation stage prior to those players' eventual jumps straight to professional ranks on this side of the pond. **Notable European transfers like Miro Heiskanen, Rasmus Dahlin and Jesperi Kotkaniemi eased into North America by playing a season of major-junior hockey to prepare for NHL readiness.** With further refinement of their all-around games, these Europeans blossomed into impact players upon finally signing with NHL clubs as teenagers. Their expedited transitions show the benefits of gaining North American experience prior to tackling professional hockey over here.
### Through the AHL Minors  
Serving as the primary development league and affiliate system for the NHL clubs are the 31 American Hockey League (AHL) teams. Beyond drafting and free agency, the AHL provides another avenue for overlooked talents to work their way up hockey's organizational ladder. Each season, there are 20-30 players who debut in the NHL after cutting their teeth in the AHL minor leagues.
While competitive, the AHL represents a step below the NHL in terms of speed, pressure and intensity. For many on the cusp of making an impact at the highest level, consistent productivity in the AHL can be the final proving ground needed to earn a promotion. **As evidenced by stars like Chris Kreider, Tyler Seguin, David Pastrnak and Dylan Larkin, a successful apprenticeship down in the minors can springboard into full-time NHL jobs.** Patience and perseverance are everything for AHL fringe talents eyeing the ultimate prize of a fulltime NHL role.
### Veteran Journeymen   
On rare occasions, a player's NHL dreams can survive well into their mid-20s or later before finally realizing a breakthrough. These lifelong underdogs keep swimming against the current year after year, refusing to give up on their professional hockey aspirations. While longshots, the possibility remains for unexpected debuts and even second chapter stories.
A prime recent example is Connor Brown, who went undrafted but tallied almost 400 NHL games and 50 goals after several seasons plugging away in the minor leagues. For diligent veterans refusing to accept their perceived ceilings, an opening always remains. Whether through injuries providing opportunities or unexpected breakouts elsewhere finally earning a shot, the door to the big leagues can spring open at any moment. For these lifelong underdogs, their improbable journeys epitomize the allure and unpredictability of professional hockey.
### Conclusion
As this overview demonstrates, the pathway to eventually playing in the NHL remains diverse and non-linear. While being drafted provides the clearest roadmap, others forge their way through Europe, North American colleges and leagues, major-junior circuits or simply by refusing to abandon hope in the AHL minors. For any young player aspiring to reach the pinnacle, their routes may involve detours, perseverance and luck. But for those with the talent and will to fight their way there, dreams can always become reality regardless of the obstacles along the way.
