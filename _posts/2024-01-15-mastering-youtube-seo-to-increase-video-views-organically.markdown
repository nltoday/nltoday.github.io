### Craft Engaging Thumbnails  
Thumbnails are the first impression viewers have of your video. Make your thumbnails **clear, appealing and complement the video title**. Opt for high resolution images with good lighting and cropping. **Include relevant text** over the thumbnail to further highlight what the video is about. Test different thumbnail designs and text placements to see which generate the best click through rates.
### Organize Videos Into Playlists
YouTube is more likely to recommend other videos from your playlists to keep viewers engaged on your channel for longer. **Group related videos into well-organized playlists** based on topics, series or categories. Give playlists descriptive titles containing your target keywords. As you publish new videos, make sure to add them to existing playlists to benefit from increased exposure.
### Optimize Internal And External Linking
Internal linking like featuring other videos or playlists in your video descriptions and end screens boosts discoverability of your entire video catalog. You can also include relevant external links **to related websites or your social profiles** in the description to drive more traffic. But make sure internal links outweigh external ones to avoid coming across as spammy to YouTube.  
### Promote Through Social Media
Although YouTube's algorithm favors **consistent uploading and audience engagement metrics**, you still need to promote your videos manually through social networks initially to gain those first few hundred views and subscribers organically. Share new videos to Facebook pages and groups, Twitter, Instagram, your blog or relevant subreddits. Engage with comments and actively participate in related communities to build your brand awareness.
### Consider Video Ads To Gain Momentum Earlier
While organic growth through YouTube and social sharing is ideal long term, **paying for video promotions through YouTube's own ad network or platforms like Google Ads can help "jumpstart" a video's performance** - especially for new channels or those with a small audience. Just $10-50 per day can significantly boost your views which then translates to more impressions in search and recommendations organically. Only use ads once you have polished production values and focus spending on Individual videos rather than the entire channel.  
### Focus On Audience Retention And Engagement
YouTube prioritizes watch time in its discoverability algorithms. The average viewer attention span is only a few minutes so you need captivating content right from the start that keeps them watching till the end. **Use intriguing intros, powerful calls to action and interactive elements like quizzes or polls throughout to maintain retention rates over 40%**. Also actively reply to comments to foster a sense of community on your channel for higher subscriber and viewer loyalty over time.
### Be Patient And Consistent With Posting
While results may not be instant, staying consistent with video uploads of 8-12 minutes at least once or twice every week tells YouTube's algorithm that your channel is a valuable source of content. It takes 28 days on average for a video to maximize its discoverability and rank well in search. **Maintain a regular schedule and quality over quantity to build momentum slowly but surely on YouTube through organic means.** Results compound when combined with the other best practices discussed here so stick with it for best results long term.
In summary, mastering on and off-page SEO factors, optimizing for engagement and retention metrics as well publishing consistently are proven tactics to boost your YouTube video views naturally over time through search and recommendations. Although growth may feel gradual at first, consistency is key to achieving success through organic means on the world's second largest search platform.
