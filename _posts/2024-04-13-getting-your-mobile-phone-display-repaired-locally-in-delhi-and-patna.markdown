Mobile phones are an essential part of our daily lives. However, they are fragile devices that can potentially get damaged. A broken mobile phone display is a common issue faced by many users. In this guide, we share our personal experiences getting mobile phone displays repaired locally in Delhi and Patna at affordable costs.
### Finding affordable display repair shops 
Getting an original replacement display from authorised service centres can be very expensive, often costing thousands of rupees. **Fortunately, local mobile repair markets offer cost-effective solutions.[ For my ](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/chihuahua)Moto G5 Plus**, the authorised service centre quoted Rs. 5000-6000 but local shops offered to repair just the broken glass for Rs. 1200-1300. While cheaper, local shops may use **non-original parts**. It's important to find reputed shops that use quality components and back their work.

### Repair experience in Delhi's Janakpuri market
After breaking my **Moto G5 Plus** display, I visited the mobile repair shops in **Janakpuri West market in Delhi.** A shop quoted Rs. 1300 to replace just the broken glass while the authorised centre insisted on replacing the entire display folder. They agreed to do the repair in front of me, which helped ensure **transparency**. The new glass had similar quality to the original. I was satisfied with their service, honesty and ability to complete the job quickly within an hour.
### Getting my Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 repaired in Patna 
More recently, I accidentally broke the display of my **Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1** while working from home. I took it to the famous **Hari Niwas mobile market in Patna** located nearby. After inspection, the technician said both touch and display needed replacement as they come integrated. He quoted Rs. 2200 but agreed to do it for Rs. 1800 after negotiation. Though I couldn't confirm if the parts were original, the new display quality was satisfactory. He finished the work transparently within half an hour.
### Tips for finding reliable local repair shops
When choosing local mobile repair shops, look for ones with:
- Reputed workshops in major markets with experience repairing various phone models
- Technicians who inspect damage transparently and provide itemised repair quotes  
- Ability to complete basic repairs like screen replacement within an hour
- Promise to use quality components that match original display specs
- Offers to demonstrate the repair or allow you to witness the work
### Preventing future damage with accessories
To prevent display breaks in future, it's a good idea to invest in protective accessories like covers and tempered glass screens. During one trip to Gaffar wholesale market in **Karol Bagh, Delhi**, I got 12 9H tempered glasses for Rs. 30 each and basic covers for Rs. 100 - much cheaper than retail. Proper cases and covers can provide crash protection for displays at low costs.
In summary, finding reliable local mobile repair shops is the most cost-effective way to get displays fixed when original replacements are disproportionately expensive. With some research, transparency and the right precautions, you can get quality repairs without burning a hole in your pocket. I hope sharing my experiences helps others facing similar situations.
