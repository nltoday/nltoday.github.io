### **States' Rights or Centralized Control?**
The Republicans have long claimed to value states' rights above centralized federal control. However, their actions contradict this claim time and time again. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs Wade, removing the federal right to abortion, Republicans argued this simply returned power to the states. Yet many top Republicans immediately began pushing for a nationwide abortion ban, showing their true priority is central control over individual autonomy and women's healthcare choices. As more "purple" and "blue" states passed laws protecting abortion access, Republican leaders made clear they see states' rights as a shield for unpopular policies, not a guiding principle.

### **Religious "Liberty" or Christian Dominion?** 
Republicans also portray themselves as defenders of religious freedom. However, their policies aim to enshrine one faith above all others. After years of talking about "Judeo-Christian values," the pretense has been dropped - what remains is an open push for laws based purely on evangelical Christian doctrine. Figures like Ron DeSantis police public school curriculums to censor any topics contradicting far-right dogma. Meanwhile, non-Christian faiths and no faiths see fewer protections. True religious liberty means equal respect and space for all beliefs, or none at all - a concept alien to today's Republican dogmatists. 
### **Limited Government or Authoritarianism?** 
Another supposed Republican value is limiting government overreach into personal lives. But under Trump and continuing today, they empower the expanding arms of the surveillance and carceral states. Trump demanded prosecution of journalists for unfavorable coverage, while Ron DeSantis replicates this hostility to free press. They claim to back law and order but undermine civil liberties. Their obsession with censoring and criminalizing political opponents shows authoritarian, not limited, tendencies. If Republicans believed in small government, power would devolve not just to states but local communities and, ultimately, individuals - yet they increasingly desire granular control over private lives and thought.
### **Fiscal Responsibility or Borrowing without Constraint?**
For decades, Republicans attacked Democrats as tax-and-spend liberals who recklessly increased national debt. However, the party has utterly abandoned any credibility on fiscal matters. Under a Republican president and Congress in 2017, they ballooned the deficit with unfunded tax cuts during a strong economy. Then, as COVID-19 bore down, they supported around $4 trillion in emergency spending but reject addressing societal problems through long-term investments. They now blame inflation on Biden despite it being a global phenomenon - yet propose no concrete plans to curb prices beyond vague culture war rhetoric. Republicans' claimed dedication to balanced budgets was pure illusion.
### **Classical Conservatism or Trumpist Populism?** 
The GOP was once the party of Burkean conservatism, favoring steady, prudent change within existing institutions. But Trumpism has seen its total capture by a new reactionary populism. Traditional conservative heroes like Burke would surely recoil at leaders who attack democratic elections, foment insurrection, and reject compromise as weakness. Yet few Congressional Republicans oppose this acceleration of polarization. While paying lip service to values like national unity, their record shows preferring reckless division for short term political gain. In abandoning guardrails on executive power and treating institutions like independent courts as enemies, the party leaves constitutional norms fatally weakened. 
### **Strong Defense or Appeasement of Autocrats?**  
A hallmark GOP position has been resolute defense of global democracy and pushback of tyrannical regimes. However, since Trump's presidency this has seriously degraded. His open admiration for dictators like Putin was alarming enough - but Republicans' broader response to Russia invading Ukraine showed their new willingness to excuse anti-Western aggression. While many initially condemned the attack, few back real action, instead choosing isolationism that risks emboldening further conquest. No longer do Republicans advocate spreading freedom - instead, under Trump's neo-isolationist spell, they equivocate in supporting our European allies against renewed fascist expansionism.
### **Colorblind Society or Reactionary Identity Politics?**
For a time, Republicans pushed the ideal that government should treat all citizens equally regardless of identity characteristics. Yet the post-Trump GOP has fully embraced white identity politics, stoking racial divisions for political gain. Figures like Tucker Carlson and Ted Cruz cultivate an overwhelmingly white, rural base through scapegoating immigrants and urban minorities. They attack anti-racism efforts while turning a blind eye to real discrimination - ensuring the party represents primarily one racial demographic. This reactionary identitarianism is the mirror image of what they hypocritically accuse progressives of doing and moves America further from the noble goal of a just, inclusive society where people are judged on character, not ancestry or appearance. 
In closing, it is concerning how radically the modern Republican Party has evolved away from the principles it once espoused. While all parties adapt to changing times, the GOP has devolved into a movement defined almost entirely by opposing liberal goals – with little consistency left regarding core philosophies of limited government, fiscal responsibility, strong defense, colorblind justice, and a commitment to small-d democratic norms. With no constructive agenda to better people's lives, they increasingly rely on reactions to social changes which jeopardize no elite interests. Americans of all stripes desire solutions to real problems – but will find little common ground with leaders who seem mainly interested in dividing society for short-term gain. For the GOP to be a viable force once more, it must reform itself around timeless values rather than temporary politicking.
