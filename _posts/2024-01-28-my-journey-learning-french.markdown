### Getting Started
When I was 12 years old, I first visited France with my family. Although I barely understood any French at the time, I was intrigued by the language and culture. On that trip, I made friends with locals who mostly spoke French. This experience sparked my interest in learning the language. 
When I returned home to Seattle, I realized that being able to communicate in French would be hugely beneficial. Many of my cultural roots were in Algeria, where French was widely spoken. I wanted to better connect with friends and family there. So in high school, I enrolled in French classes to gain the basic foundations.

### Mastering the Fundamentals with Duolingo
After that initial schooling, I knew I needed to devote more focused study time to French. In late 2015, I downloaded the popular language learning app [Duolingo](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-matching-outfits-for-holiday-poodle-dog-christmas-tree-2) and diligently worked through their entire French course tree. This gave me crucial practice with vocabulary, grammar, and reading comprehension. While it was a slow process, completing the Duolingo program equipped me with a solid baseline.
### The Challenge of Immersion  
Once I finished Duolingo, maintaining momentum in French became difficult living in an English-speaking environment. I yearned for fuller immersion to take my skills to the next level. In early 2017, I pursued opportunities to speak French with classmates and language exchange partners online. This helped expand my vocabulary for everyday conversations. Still, progress plateaued without more extensive exposure.
### A Crucial Second Trip to France
To break through, I knew I needed full linguistic immersion abroad once more. In the summer of 2017, my family and I traveled back to France. Being surrounded by the language daily worked wonders. After just one week, I started having whole thoughts in French without translating first. Interacting with locals boosted my confidence enormously. This trip truly took my abilities to a new level.
### Fueling Progress Through Content Consumption
Upon returning home, I was hungry for ways to maintain this momentum. I began actively seeking out French-language content in various formats like books, music, movies, podcasts and video games. Consumption of **French rap music** especially became a staple, allowing me to absorb vocals, lyrics, and street slang. This **submersion in diverse French media** proved highly effective for continual learning outside the classroom. 
### Earning Placement in High School Classes  
In early 2018, I took a French proficiency assessment to determine appropriate class enrollment for 9th grade. To my delight, I tested into the second-year course rather than having to repeat fundamentals. Being in a more advanced class environment further accelerated my progress through richer materials and discussions. This achievement showed how far self-study had brought me in just a few years.
### Cultivating Strong Comprehension Skills
Over the next two years, dedicated practice of various learning techniques helped refine my abilities. Formats like translating songs, movies and articles word-for-word while cross-referencing dictionaries strengthened my grasp of grammar, idioms and advanced vocabulary. Constant exposure to native French through social media, shows and podcasts also developed strong listening comprehension. By late 2020, conversing, reading and writing in French had become second nature.
### Maintaining Motivation Through Goals and Connections
Reaching fluency in French has required tremendous dedication, but focusing on fun goals has kept me highly motivated. A key driver was being able to meaningfully connect with relatives and friends in Algeria and France through the shared language. Traveling abroad to immerse and practice French face-to-face proved exceptionally rewarding each time. Consistently challenging and improving myself also feels hugely accomplishing. With continuous learning and use of the language today, I aim to maintain and further develop my French skills for years to come.
