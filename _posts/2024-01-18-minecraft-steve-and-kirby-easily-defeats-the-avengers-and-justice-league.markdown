### [Steve uses Creative Mode and TNT to destroy Konohagakure](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/chihuahua-lover)
Just like Pain used the Shinra Tensei to destroy Konohagakure, Steve from Minecraft enters the battlefield in his unstoppable Creative Mode. He effortlessly spawns dozens of TNT blocks throughout the Hidden Leaf Village with a single command. With another command, he detonates all the TNT simultaneously, leveling the entire village and anyone within it in an instant. 
The Avengers and Justice League have no chance to react or counter such an overwhelming explosion. Within moments, the bodies of Iron Man, Captain America, Batman, Wonder Woman and all others litter the ruined landscape. Steve doesn't stop there though, he continues methodically searching through the wreckage, ensuring that no survivors remain by using "/kill" commands on any entities detected. The villages is laid to waste, and the heroes are defeated before even getting a chance to fight back.

### **Kirby's planet-level attacks obliterate the opposing team** 
Meanwhile, the pink puffball Kirby joins the fray. Due to his feats such as absorbing a dimension-destroying entity, it's clear Kirby's power is at a planetary scale minimum. He effortlessly flies across the battlefield at faster-than-light speeds. In the blink of an eye, Kirby reaches the Avengers and Justice League, who are still recovering from Steve's TNT explosion. 
Kirby unleashes a single "super-nova" style attack, compressing his massive planet-busting energy into a concentrated blast. The beam cuts through the heroes like a hot knife through butter. Their bodies are vaporized on an atomic level, entirely erased from existence. Not a single trace of the heroes remains. Kirby's casual planet-level firepower is too much for even the combined "Earth's Mightiest Heroes" and "World's Greatest Detectives" to endure.
### **Sonic's speedster abilities outmatch any opposition** 
While Steve and Kirby quickly handle their opponents, the **speedster hedgehog Sonic** enters the scene at his trademark supersonic speeds. As one of the fastest beings in all of fiction, capable of travelling faster than light, the Avengers and Justice League have no hope of tracking his movements, let alone making an attack. 
Sonic weaves between his stationary opponents in a blue blur. He lands blows on every hero simultaneously, punching, kicking and homingattacking so fast that to any onlookers it appears as if every hero is attacked at once from all directions. Within seconds, every last hero lies motionless on the ground, beaten thoroughly by Sonic's overwhelming speed. They never landed a single attack in return. Sonic stands victorious, hardly breaking a sweat against such inferiorly paced foes.
### **Kirby and Sonic outclass top Dragon Ball fighters**
Considering **Kirby's absorbed abilities include destroying entire planes of existence**, and Sonic regularly faces universe-ending threats across time and space, it's evident they far outstrip even Dragon Ball Super's strongest fighters. 
While Goku and others harness planet-busting Ki blasts and above, Kirby has casually tanked and survived dimension-destroying impacts. His raw power potential exceeds anyone in Akira Toriyama's series. Meanwhile, Sonic's immeasurably fast speed statistically surpasses even Ultra Instinct Sign Goku and Vegeta. He could blitz and defeat them before their bodies registered an attack.
Comparing the scaling feats of Kirby, Sonic and Minecraft Steve to heroes in other popular settings clearly shows they stand at the very apex of fictional power and would handily defeat even the mightiest teams like the Avengers or Justice League. Against such godlike opponents, the outcome is never in doubt.
### **Minecraft in "Hardcore Mode" ups the ante further**
So far Steve has fought in his default Creative Mode, becoming effectively omnipotent. But what if we upped the challenge and had him face the heroes in the more grounded "Hardcore Mode" instead? Here, Steve can be killed in just a few hits if overwhelmed. 
However, Steve still possesses immense survival skills from years of gameplay. He quickly mines stone and iron, crafting tools and armor on the move. Using this gear, he engages the heroes head-on. His precise sword swings block their attacks, while returning strikes of his own. Steve knows the tactical advantages of terrain too, luring opponents into traps he laid on the fly.
Despite the difficulty increase, Steve's ingenuity, preparation and precision see him emerge victorious once more. His experience conquering randomly generated worlds grants sharper instincts than any hero. In Hardcore, Steve still claims a skillful solo win through adaptive gameplay alone.
### **Kirby survives a dimension-destroying punch unharmed**
During one adventure, **Kirby faced off against Void Termina, a seemingly unstoppable eldritch god.** The creature attempted to destroy Popstar by punching a hole through the dimension separating it from the real world. Seeing this universal threat, Kirby selflessly threw himself at Termina's fist to stop the dimension-rending blow. 
Incredibly, Kirby survived unscathed. He withstood an impact that destroyed an entire plane of reality yet emerged without a scratch. This exemplifies the true mightiness of Kirby's resilience and durability on a scale necessary to withstand dimension-warping universal attacks. 
Kirby has also easily swallowed planet-sized foes whole before, showing his insides are a pocket dimension in their own right. With ability to shrug off dimension-busting strikes and house celestial bodies internally, Kirby has proven indefatigable fortitude beyond any Avenger or Leaguer. Against beings like this, victory is assured no matter what.
### **Steve crafts with infinite resources**
Some may argue Steve's supplies would deplete over time in a long battle. However, one must remember that creative mode grants him **infinite resources** to craft with. Steve possesses unlimited blocks of all types, giving him inexhaustible building materials.
He could construct towering fortresses, traps, contraptions and weapons of unprecedented scale. Ingenious structures like Redstone-powered cannons, TNT launchers and mob spawn kits would completely alter the landscape and give him technological edges. 
Furthermore, Steve only needs a single ingot or gem to instantly conjure a full set of impenetrable Netherite armor and tools via crafting. His reserves are bottomless. No amount of destroyed equipment could slow Steve, as he happily recrafts from limitless supplies. Against opponents without such omnipotent construction, Steve crushes through strategy and numbers alone.
### **Conclusion** 
In summary, characters like Minecraft Steve, Sonic and Kirby simply outclass even the mightiest fictional heroes when powers and feats are cross-compared fairly. Their planet-busting resilience, nigh-omnipotence, infinite resources and immeasurable speed totally outmatch any opposition. 
Strategic use of terrain, traps and commands means Steve claims solo wins in both Creative and Hardcore. Kirby survives even dimension-destroying impacts unharmed, while Sonic blitzes at lightspeeds. Compared to these godlike entities, teams fall in seconds regardless of member skill or numbers. A sweep is assured for Steve, Kirby and Sonic wherever their unstoppable abilities are brought to clash.
