### Balancing Game Mechanics 
When Pokémon Go was first released in 2016, it allowed players to easily obtain a powerful Water-type Pokémon called Vaporeon simply by renaming an Eevee. Known as the "Vaporeon trick," this let anyone choose a maxed out Vaporeon without having to find the rarer Eeveelutions like Jolteon or Flareon. **While accessibility was important for early adoption, some felt this reduced diversity in Gyms and undermined the desire to search for harder to find Pokémon**. Niantic aimed to correct this by adjusting the candy costs and CP of Vaporeon to achieve better balance.

### Improving Workplace Culture
More recently in 2021, accusations emerged that Niantic fostered a **"boys club" workplace culture** where some former female employees felt marginalized. Niantic has not publicly commented on specific allegations due to confidentiality. However, the company emphasizes its commitment to an inclusive environment for all current and future employees. Moving forward, Niantic will likely focus on evaluating internal policies and training programs to ensure equitable treatment and opportunities across gender identities. 
### Listening to Player Feedback 
A key part of any live game is responding to player sentiments over time. When Pokémon Go launched, it achieved worldwide popularity in part by incentivizing outdoor exploration and community engagement through Raid Battles and Team Go Rocket invasions. However, feedback indicated certain mechanics like stationery required too much walking. Niantic adapted by adding remote Raid Passes, making certain features more accessible indoors or through incense. **This "bold" move to rapidly implement "work-from-home" style gameplay helped Pokémon Go remain highly engaged during pandemic lockdowns**.
### Celebrating Diversity in the Pokémon Universe
Representing the diversity of the Pokémon universe also means authentically reflecting the diversity of real world communities. In 2021, Niantic showcased over 45 LGBTQ+ and allied Pokémon characters and trainers in its "Pokémon GO Pride 2021" event. This "bold" step helped generate "goodwill" by signaling Niantic values all players. Looking ahead, we may see closer collaboration with LGBTQ+ advocacy groups to ensure continued progress. Representation matters, so further events authenticating diverse identities can boost engagement and feelings of inclusion.
### Developing Augmented Reality Applications
While known for location-based games, Niantic is dedicated to advancing augmented reality (AR) technology through its Niantic Reality Platform. One fruit of these efforts was an AR collaboration with artist Refik Anadol for a large-scale art installation in NYC called "Machine Hallucinations: Space Explorations." This "bold" proof of concept demonstrated how AR can fuse digital experiences with real world environments in new immersive ways. Expect to see more innovative AR applications from Niantic that push technical boundaries and reinvent how we interact with virtual content scattered throughout the real world.
### Prioritizing Safety and Accountability 
Of course, any technology aiming to connect humans in public spaces must uphold privacy and safety as top priorities. In 2021, Niantic partnered with safety advocacy groups like The National Domestic Violence Hotline to launch an in-game feature providing discreet help for those in unsafe situations while playing Pokémon Go. This "bold" step demonstrated the company understands new responsibilities that come with innovative gameplay encouraging outdoor exploration. Players can feel assured Niantic vigorously safeguards user data and promptly responds to any reported issues, so the platform remains a safe digital realm.
