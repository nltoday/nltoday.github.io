### Setting up for Fishing
One of the first steps to catching fish in Minecraft Pocket Edition survival mode is to make sure you have the proper tools. You will need an empty bucket to place the fish in after catching them. Craft an iron bucket by using one iron ingot in a crafting table. It's also a good idea to have some type of rod that you can use to lure in and catch the fish. Early game, a wooden tool works fine. Later, stronger rods like those made of iron have higher chances of a successful catch.

### Seeking Out Fish Spawns
With bucket and rod in hand, it's time to locate some fish. Many biomes have fish naturally swimming around in bodies of water like rivers, lakes, and oceans. Carefully scan the waters near your starting area looking for the small shadowy movements of fish under the surface. Pay close attention to areas near lily pads or sea grass as those seem to be popular locations for fish spawns. If you don't see any fish after searching a few minutes, try exploring farther afield to new water sources.
### Catching Fish the Long Way 
Once you spot fish, start by right-clicking your rod near them to get their attention. The fish will begin following the pull of your line under the water. Slowly move the rod back towards you while continuing to hold right-click. **This "long press"** technique simulates reeling in a fish on a fishing line. Timing is important - release right-click too soon and the fish escapes. Hold too long and your line breaks. With practice, you'll get a feel for how long to hold before the fish is close enough to catch. 
### Using a Bucket For Instant Capture
There is an easier fishing method that doesn't require the long press timing. Simply splash the water near fish with a water bucket. This will temporarily transform the whole 1x1 area into a water source block that the fish is now swimming in. Quickly use an empty bucket on the fish's new position to pick them up right away, whisking them off to your inventory in an instant. This bucket trick makes fishing a breeze, especially helpful when in a rush or just starting out.
### Storing Your Fresh Catch
After catching fish through either the long press or bucket methods, you'll end up with live fish flopping around in your inventory. The best thing to do is place them into the water bucket you crafted earlier. Drop the bucket into any sizable body of water like a river or lake near your base. The fish will swim freely in the new 1x1 water source biome contained in the bucket. Now you have a portable fish supply that won't perish over time like they would in your inventory slots. Just pick the bucket back up whenever you need a fresh fish meal.
### Improving Your Fishing Skills and Luck
With practice, your reaction times and ability to judge the long press timing will steadily improve until you consistently catch fish without issue. Certain enchantments like Luck of the Sea and Lure on fishing rods also boost the chances of reeling in fish instead of junk items. Fishing at dawn or dusk near lily pads is another strategy that makes rare treasure enchantments more likely to appear. Mastering efficient fishing techniques is important for stocking your food stores in survival without much effort spent gathering resources constantly.
