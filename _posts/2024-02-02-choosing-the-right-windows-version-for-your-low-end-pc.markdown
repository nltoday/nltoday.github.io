Choosing the best Windows version to run smoothly on a low-end PC can be tricky. Let's break down the options and factors to consider.
### 32-bit vs 64-bit
For older PCs with 4GB RAM or less, a 32-bit Windows may be better than a 64-bit version. While 32-bit limits RAM to 4GB, it uses system resources more efficiently. **However, no current versions of Windows offer 32-bit anymore.**
A 64-bit version allows using more than 4GB RAM but is less optimized for low-end hardware. **With only 4GB RAM, a 32-bit OS could actually outperform a 64-bit OS.** The tradeoff is that a 64-bit OS is required if upgrading the PCâ€™s RAM later on.

### Edition Differences 
Among 64-bit versions, Windows 10 [Home edition](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-holiday-family-matching-the-lacrosse-gnome-christmas-3) is best for low-spec PCs as it has lighter system requirements than **Pro edition**. **Windows 10 Pro offers features like BitLocker and group policy editing not needed for most home users.** 
**Windows 10S mode** further streamlines the system but severely limits software installation to only apps from Microsoft Store. This is too restrictive for many tasks.
### Alternative Operating Systems
For truly antiquated hardware, **Linux distributions** like **Linux Mint provide a smoother experience**. **Linux uses system resources much more efficiently** while offering a full-featured desktop experience. It supports everyday tasks like browsing, writing docs, and media playback.
The downsides are fewer compatible games/programs and more technical know-how required for Linux. But for basic tasks on dated PCs, Linux is a worthy consideration.
### System Specs and Requirements
To ensure decent performance, refer to Microsoft's minimum requirements for the latest Windows editions. **Windows 10 Home needs 2GB RAM minimum but 4GB or more is recommended for comfortable usage.** An Intel **Celeron or AMD Athlon processor from the last 10 years** should suffice. 
16GB storage is the minimum but leaving space for future updates is wise. Check your specific hardware against requirements online before deciding. Slower hardware may benefit more from a **lightweight Linux distribution instead of Windows.**
### In Summary
For an older low-end PC, the best Windows version is usually 10 Home in 64-bit. But if it has only 4GB RAM or is truly outdated, a 32-bit version or lightweight **Linux distribution could extract better performance**. Check system specs against requirements and consider alternatives to Windows if the hardware is very dated. With the right OS choice, you can still productively use even an elderly PC.
### Additional Tweaks
Beyond just the OS choice, tweaking Windows settings can also improve usability on an older system:
- Disable visual effects and animations under Display settings 
- Reduce screen resolution to match your display's native resolution
- Tune power settings to prioritize performance over energy savings
- Close background apps and services when not in use 
- Use a lightweight browser like Firefox instead of Chrome
- Install an updated antivirus only if essential 
- Only install software packages actually needed 
With some optimization efforts, you can squeeze extra life out of dated hardware. The right OS and configuration tweaks make a big difference to user experience on low-end PCs.
