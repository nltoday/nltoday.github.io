Predicting someone's horoscope without their date of birth, time of birth or place of birth details seems impossible. However, there are few ancient techniques of Vedic astrology that can help determine one's birth chart accurately by just asking them question at present. Let's explore these techniques in detail:
### Horary Astrology 
Horary astrology, also known as prashna jyotish or question astrology, analyses the chart cast for the time when the question is being asked. This chart is then matched with planetary positions, aspects, signs, houses and other factors to arrive at accurate answers. The logic is that current planetary interactions can reflect upon past and future events.

### Lost Horoscopy through Palmistry
Traditional palmistry involves reading minute markings, lines and textures on palms and fingers to discern one's horoscope including sun-sign, moon-sign, planetary placement and timing of life events. However, this science has been nearly lost today with only few families and schools retaining such accurate palm reading skills.
### Lost Horoscopy through Prashna Techniques
An entire branch of astrology called Nashta Jataka or Lost Horoscopy helps determine the birth chart using predictive techniques applied to the prashna or question chart. Some of the deduction processes involve:
- Correlating moon's placement in question chart to Jupiter's placement in birth chart and thereby the year of birth. 
- Determining northern/southern motion of planets from lagna chart to arrive at birth season.
- Calculating birth tithi or lunar day from the sun'ssign and degree in question chart.
- Finding birth timing- day or night- based on the lagna sign's nature. 
- Aligning lagna degrees to sunrise/sunset times to get birth time in ghatis from which the exact birth time can be established.
Once the Month, Date, Year and Time are estimated, the birth chart is cast and past life events are matched for validation. This technique can determine charts accurately in over 80% cases.
### Lost Horoscopy through Divisional Charts
In addition to question and predictive techniques, rectification of birth details also involves studying various [divisionalcharts](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-holiday-best-poodle-mom-ever-ugly-christmas-sweater-1) like navamsha, dashamsha, chaturvimsamsa etc. Subtle placements or positioning of planets in these divisional charts act as clues to refine estimated birth parameters through back-calculation.
This Lost Horoscopy method relying on divisional charts is very tedious needing an experienced astrologer's fine-tuned study. But it can offer reliable results even without initial birth data when other techniques provide partial leads.
### Validating Estimated Birth Charts
Once the month, date, year and time are determined either through a combination of the above horoscopic questioning techniques or single reliable method, an estimated birth chart is drawn up. 
To validate its accuracy, life details already shared by the native in initial questioning are matched against past transits in this chart.Further, asking about one or two memorable childhood or early life incidents can help verify the chart beyond doubts.
Only when past events align neatly is the assessed lost chart deemed authentic enough for delivering astrological readings or predictions to the native. Else, additional refinement may be required through rectification until high certainty is attained.
### Summary
In summary, gaining lost birth details without initial data may seem impossible but Vedic astrology harbours invaluable questioning techniques like Horary, Nashta Jataka and Lost Horoscopy to determine charts accurately in majoritycases. Palmistry too if reliably practiced can reveal complete horoscope.With an experienced astrologer's dedicated efforts and native's responses, a validated natal chart can be reconstructed.
