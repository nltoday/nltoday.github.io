# The Rise of Digital Game Sales
As technology has advanced and digital infrastructure has improved, the video game industry has seen a dramatic shift away from physical game sales and toward digital distribution. According to statistics from the game market intelligence firm NPD Group, in the United States between 2009 and 2018, physical game sales dropped from accounting for 80% of the market to only 17%. Similarly, analysis of NPD data shows that between 2018 and 2021, physical console game sales in the US fell from representing 23% of the market to just 10%. 
These trends have continued internationally as well. Data for 2022 indicates that on a global scale, **over 94% of all video game sales** that year were digital, leaving physical discs and cartridges to make up a mere 5.8% of the market. However, there are some notable differences when considering different platforms. While console games still saw around 28% of their sales come from physical discs as of 2022, the figure for PC games was even lower at only 2% from "boxed" physical copies.
### # The Dominance of Digital on PC
The PC gaming sector has led the way in terms of digital distribution's dominance. Major digital storefronts and launchers like **Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store** now account for an estimated 98% of game sales on computers. This is understandable given several factors inherent to PC gaming. For one, optical disc drives have been optional components on computers for many years now, so [physical media is an afterthought for most PC gamers](https://store.fi.io.vn/game-controller-christmas-for-video-gamers-boys-kids-455/women&). Additionally, indie games and smaller titles with limited marketing budgets rarely see physical releases at all, further pushing people to digital storefronts for access to the entire PC gaming library. 
Even some larger multi-platform games that do receive physical "boxed" PC versions still require activation on digital platforms like Steam. In these cases, the disc is often just used to avoid re-downloading the entire game files rather than providing truly offline access. With patches, updates, and downloadable content also needing to be acquired digitally, physical PC gamers still rely heavily on consistent online access. It's little wonder then that the PC market has fully embraced downloading games instead of retail boxes long before consoles caught up.

### Variation Among Consoles
While trends point to digital gaming becoming the norm across all platforms, console games have maintained a more prominent physical presence relative to PC. In 2022, around 28% of console games were estimated to still sell primarily through retail discs rather than digital storefronts. However, even within the console sector some variation exists. According to an analysis of NPD Group sales data, **the decline in physical console game releases** between 2018 and 2021 was more pronounced on PlayStation and Xbox systems than on the Nintendo Switch. 
Over that period, PlayStation saw a 38% drop in new physical titles, Xbox a decline of around 31%, but the Switch experienced a more modest decrease under 7%. Reasons for the Switch's relative strength with physical media could include the platform's emphasis on indie games appealing to collectors as well as its hybrid design appealing to handheld play away from consistent internet access. But overall, the direction of travel is abundantly clear. Barring any disruptive new innovations, digital distributions seems set to **account for the vast majority of console game spending within this decade**, continuing the patterns set by PC gaming.
### # A Boon for Digital Storefront Access 
With the waning popularity of physical discs, the dominant way consumers access new video game content has become through digital storefronts rather than physical retail. This has been a huge boon for major platforms like **PlayStation Store, Xbox Marketplace, Nintendo eShop, and Steam**. In addition to serving as the primary destination to purchase new blockbuster games at launch, digital storefronts also control access to a long tail of outdated titles and growing catalogs of smaller indie games. Owners of these storefronts like Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, and Valve have seen their businesses grow tremendously as digital distribution becomes the industry standard.
However, the rise of digital has not been without issues around things like game **preservation as server shutdowns remove games** purchased years ago. It has also concentrated power over the secondary market in the hands of storefront owners rather than independent resellers. But for the companies running these services, capturing the majority of game spending through their proprietary platforms has translated to **$multi-billions in annual digital game sales revenue**. With physical games now niche even on consoles, that digital-first business model looks certain to only strengthen further in the coming years.
### Physical Games Hold On As Collectibles
While the game industry has left physical media in the rearview mirror, completely written off the format would be premature. A dedicated segment of gamers maintains enthusiasm for the **physical collectibles and merchandising aspect** inherent to boxed game releases. Companies like **Limited Run Games have found success** curating limited physical runs of niche retro titles and indie darlings with strong cult followings. 
These business help gaming collectors satisfy their hobby while also driving additional sales revenue for titles. The popularity of such boutique physical publishers indicates there remains an audience appealingly willing to pay a premium for **disc versions of their favorites games and soundtracks on vinyl**. As long as this collecting subculture persists, demand for well-produced boxed editions of select titles may yet sustain physical gaming media as a niche segment of the multi-billion dollar industry.
### The New Normal of Digital Gaming
It is abundantly clear that over the last decade-plus, digital distribution and online storefronts have come to totally dominate the video games industry revenue landscape. The age of travelling to brick-and-mortar retailers to browse gaming shelves for the latest retail hits is now a relic of the past. For major publishers and smaller indie developers alike, proprietary digital platforms offer unparalleled access to the growing global gaming audience.
While physical discs maintain a hold among dedicated console bases and collectors, their wider relevance continues to diminish with each passing year. Barring a revolution in games delivery that makes **offline access and resale more practical**, digital purchases appear poised to rise to 100% market share before long. As high-speed internet proliferates and digital storefronts mature, online game shopping has become the new normal for the majority of today's gamers. The merits of preservation and flexibility of physical ownership notwithstanding, digital dominion over game distribution now defines the modern realities of the multi-billion dollar gaming business.
