Instagram universally applies the same algorithm when counting views for Reels across all regions of the world. The platform does not treat any geographic area differently in this regard. An explainer article from marketing agency GreenBuzz sheds some light on the inner workings.
### Multiple Views from a Single User 
As per the article, for a video to receive a view, the user must watch it for a minimum of three seconds. Interestingly, Instagram will count multiple views from the same person as long as they watch for over three seconds each time. Even self-views by watching your own video multiple times of over three seconds are tallied. This allows creators to strategically boost their view counts.

### Reels Insights for Marketers 
When viewing insights for Reels under the dedicated tab, Instagram notes that 'Plays' represent the number of times a video starts playing after an initial impression. A play only counts after one millisecond of playback to exclude accidental replays. This division of 'Plays' and 'Impressions' gives marketers a deeper understanding of viewership.
### Same User Behavior Counts Separately
While views from one user may seem repetitive, Instagram actually separates them into 'Reach' and 'Impressions'. Reach indicates the number of unique accounts reached, while Impressions represent the total number of times content was displayed. This granular data helps advertisers assess the true performance of their campaigns. 
### Dealing with Unexpected Low Views
It is common for highly engaging videos to suddenly receive fewer views than usual, as explained by a commenter. They routinely gain 4,000-20,000 views but one post stalled at 50 after two hours. Deleting and reposting the next day can sometimes reset the algorithm. Low initial viewership may indicate the video is not resonating and needs adjustment.
### Optimizing for [Hashtag discovery](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-but-psycho-bae-darling-crazy-girlfriend-t-shirt/men&)
As per the GreenBuzz article, hashtags are powerful tools to boost visibility on Instagram. On average, hashtag usage increases engagement by over 12%. It also recommends using a branded hashtag, as 70% of popular hashtags are company-specific. This allows discovery through relevant hashtag searches.
### Leveraging Influencer **Marketing collaborations** 
Partnering with influencers is another tactic, as their engaged audiences genuinely trust recommendations. If an influencer advocates for a product, their followers may perceive it as credible too. Working with micro-influencers in particular can provide authentic exposure to niche communities. 
### Timing Posts for Maximum **Organic reach**
The article mentions that Mondays and Thursdays between 8-9AM see the best organic performance. Posting at 5PM or late evenings from 9PM-8AM also tends to work well. Wednesday 7PM and Sunday often see lower engagement levels. It's generally advisable to avoid the 3-4PM slot. However, unique audiences require customized testing to identify prime times.
### Boosting with **Paid Instagram ads**
If organic efforts are not achieving goals, advertising is a scalable option. While ads require budgets, they can quickly multiply viewership by exposing the content to new potential customers outside the existing follower base. Targeting the right audiences with compelling creatives ensures the best return on ad spend. 
### Consistency and Authenticity are Key
At the core, truly understanding one's brand identity and creating accordingly leads to success on Instagram. Gimmicky tactics seldom retain users for long. Regular posting informed by data-driven experimentation, along with authentic engaging experiences, build true advocates over time.
