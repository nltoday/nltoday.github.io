### Buying Games on Steam And Activating with CD Keys
From experience, you [can](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-working-out-funny-chihuahua-fitness-gym-installing-muscles-illustrations5187-t-shirt) buy games on Steam to "try it out" and then refund to purchase the same game during a sale elsewhere and activate through a CD key. However, there are some important factors to consider. When purchasing on Steam, you **won't receive a CD key** to activate the game elsewhere after refunding. The only way this would work is if the other retailer provided a CD key upon purchase.

### Steam Refund Policy and Playtime Limits
It's important to be mindful of Steam's refund policy. You can only receive a refund for games you've purchased through Steam. Anything activated via CD key must be refunded through the original retailer. Additionally, Steam has a **2-hour cumulative playtime limit** for refund eligibility. This means the total time spent in-game across all play sessions can't exceed 2 hours. For example, if you do a 60-minute demo and then buy and play for an hour more, you likely wouldn't qualify for a refund.
### Additional Factors That May Impact Refunds
Steam may also look at **the frequency of refund requests from an account**. Filing too many refunds in a short time frame could trigger a manual review. Other companies have similar policies, reviewing frequent refund activity as potential abuse of return policies. It's generally best to thoroughly research games before buying to limit unnecessary refunds that could impact future eligibility.
### Dealing With Refund Denials From Steam
What options exist if Steam denies a refund request due to playtime or other factors? In some cases, it may be possible to explain the situation and request a one-time exception. Having a clear reason for why you now want a refund, within reason, can help support the request. However, Steam is within its rights to enforce published policies, so exceptions likely depend on individual circumstances and aren't guaranteed.
### Contacting the Original Retailer For a Refund 
If Steam denies the refund, the next step would be contacting the original game retailer used to provide the activation key. Explain that you purchased the key to "try out" the game on Steam but were denied a refund due to playtime limits. Some retailers may offer refunds on unredeemed keys within a reasonable return window. Policies vary by company though, so results may differ. It's important to retain any emails of the original purchase as proof of source.
### Weighing Alternatives Like Gifting or Selling the Game
If all refund options are exhausted, some people may opt to remove the game from their Steam library and either gift it to a friend, or try selling their Steam account. However, this risks violating Steam Subscriber Agreement terms. A safer alternative is accepting the denial, learning from the experience, and being more careful about researching games before buying in the future to avoid similar situations.
### Summary
In summary, there are a few important factors to consider when trying to "demo" Steam games for potential future refunds and purchases elsewhere. Understanding policies on refund eligibility, purchase sources and alternative resolution channels can help manage expectations and make informed choices going forward for any digital game purchases.
