### Film Advancement
The holes on the sides of traditional film reels, known as sprocket holes, play a vital role in advancing the film through projectors and other film equipment. Located along the edges of the film, these circular holes engage with sprocket teeth or pins inside the equipment, which rotate to move the film frame by frame in a precise manner. **Without sprocket holes, it would not be possible to precisely transport the film or synchronize the moving images with sound.**

### Scene Transitions and Effects 
Some films featured additional notches or gaps between the sprocket holes, called cue marks or punch holes. These served as reference points to indicate changes like transitions between reels or scenes. **Different placement and styles of cue markings helped film crews seamlessly switch scenes and integrate visual effects.** For example, corner cue marks signaled particular scene transitions or effects, while center cues enabled finely-tuned synchronization of audio and visuals. 
### Telecine Transfers and Editing
Closely resembling cue marks, edgemarks were located on the very edge of the filmstrip. During the analog film era, these edge-printed markings assisted the telecine transfer process of converting motion picture film into video formats. **Edgemarks also aided nonlinear video editing by matching shots and maintaining sync between film and tape.** Without such synchronization aids, integrating video from multiple sources would have been far more difficult.
### Material Choices and Holes
Early film reels often utilized heavy cast metals like gold, leading to bulky, labor-intensive reels. Later reels employed lighter-weight materials like aluminum to reduce carrying weight and handling stress. **Various hole patterns emerged based on the reel material - aluminum reels featured circular holes while earlier gold reels had a distinctive artistic style.** Functional and ornamental, these holes serve both technical and aesthetic purposes.
### Wall Décor and Memorabilia  
Vintage film reels have become decorative wall accessories and memorabilia, with their distinctive shapes and surface engravings eliciting nostalgia. **Especially when loaded with surviving film footage, empty reels transform into historical time capsules.** Filmmakers and archivists occasionally place reels on display to commemorate key productions, directors or genres. Regardless of original use, empty reels continue inspiring new applications and preserving movie heritage.
### Reel Preservation  
As motion picture technology advanced digitally, film reels transitioned from an industrial necessity to historic artifacts. While many were simply discarded, interested parties began collecting and cataloging and reels for preservation. **Museums and archives now carefully store racks of reels as visual records of 20th century entertainment.** Conservation efforts slow deterioration to keep intact physical elements representing milestones in visual storytelling. Through such stewardship, future generations may better appreciate cinema’s development and rely on original sources for restoration.
