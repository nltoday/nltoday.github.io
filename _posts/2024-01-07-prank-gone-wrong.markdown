The idea seemed harmless at first. As a joke between close friends, I thought we could play a small prank on my parents to give them a good scare. But things didn't go as planned, and it quickly escalated into something much worse. 
## Strange Happenings
Late one night, I set up a hidden camera in my bedroom to record while my friend and I acted out bizarre sleepwalking scenes. We spoke in strange voices and pretended to get instructions from some invisible "master". The next day, my parents noticed the strange footage but didn't think much of it. 
A few nights later, we staged an even creepier scene. Under the cover of darkness, my friend sneaked into my room wearing a disguise. On camera, it looked like a stranger had invaded our home and was manipulating me while I slept. Now my parents were genuinely worried. They reviewed the tapes repeatedly but could find no explanation.

As the days passed, the "incidents" only grew more disturbing. I pretended to cut locks of "hair" from my sleeping mother's head on my friend's orders. My parents were terrified, checking security cameras constantly with no sign of intruders. They seriously considered calling the police but had no evidence of a real crime. The psychological toll was taking its effect.

## A Dark Twist  
My friend suggested our next act should involve a threat. Speaking through me in our "trance", he warned that if my parents tried to get help, some relative would be attacked. I went along, caught up in the moment, but soon realized we had crossed a line. My poor parents were nearing a breakdown watching me spiral further into this "possession".

I knew I had to end the prank before it caused lasting harm. But how could I convince them it was all fake without losing their trust or facing legal trouble? Coming clean riskily, I suggested cutting my mother's hair, hoping she would refuse and see through the ruse. Thankfully, she did, and we were finally able to admit the cruel deception.
## Repairing the Damage
In the difficult discussion that followed, I took full responsibility for my reckless actions and stupidity. Rebuilding their confidence in my sanity and regaining their forgiveness would be a long road. As for my friend, I cut off all contact and sincerely apologized for dragging him into such a hateful scheme. Still, the emotional trauma lingers like a dark cloud, a painful lesson in how easily a harmless joke can spiral into something monstrous if not reined in quickly. My only hope is that with time and effort, the damage can fully heal.
## A Cautionary Tale
Looking back, I see how blind I was to the seriousness of manipulating people's fears, even if just pretending. Psychologically tormenting loved ones for entertainment is never acceptable. While pranks between close friends can bring laughter, they must respect boundaries and people's well-being. This experience taught me to consider potential consequences before any action and to cherish the trust in relationships above all else. If my mistake can persuade even one person not to endanger family for a prank, perhaps some good may come of this dark chapter after all.
