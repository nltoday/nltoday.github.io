### Starting from Scratch
When you have no savings, the idea of making a crore monthly seems impossible. However, with determination and perseverance, it can be achieved through multiple streams of online income. Let's break it down step-by-step:
To start, take up any job that pays daily wages like [construction laborer](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-4th-of-july-merica-men-women-american-flag-gifts-chihuahua-dog) to save money quickly. Work diligently for 10-12 months to accumulate around Rs. 1-2 lakhs. This capital will be invested to kickstart your entrepreneurial journey.

### Purchasing Your First Asset
With Rs. 1.5 lakhs saved, buy a new CNG **auto rickshaw** on loan. Using the auto for passengers, earn around Rs. 30,000 per month after deducting costs. Continue working diligently for 17 months to repay the auto loan and save another Rs. 5-6 lakhs. 
By now, you would have gained valuable experience in transportation business and customer relations. Use the savings to buy a used car suitable for **ride-hailing applications** like Uber. Working 18-20 hours per week for another 10-12 months should earn you close to Rs 10 lakhs.
### Expanding Your Business Ventures 
Once you have Rs. 10 lakhs capital, start a small **general store** selling daily grocery and household items in a populated neighborhood. Run it efficiently while continuing your daily Uber rides.  
Reinvest all profits to gradually increase the store size and product range. Within a year, open a second similar store somewhere else. Continue expanding store network every 6-12 months through systematic reinvestment of earnings.  
In 3-4 years of diligent effort, you would be operating 8-10 stores across cities, giving a combined monthly net income of Rs 60-80 lakhs through your retail mini empire.
### Diversifying Into Higher Income Streams
It is now time to enter bigger businesses with higher revenue potential. Use the Rs. 6-8 crore business valuation of your stores empire to explore new options:
- Apply for a bank loan and establishment grants to set up a medium scale **rice mill** in a major production region. Cost Rs. 20 crores but returns Rs. 50 lakhs monthly profit.
- Invest remaining capital to open online retail websites in high demand categories like **fashion apparel** or **consumer electronics.** Outsource operations and focus on marketing to cross Rs. 50 lakhs revenue within a year. 
- Dabble in stock market trading and **mutual funds** with guidance from experienced investors. Aim for 20-30% annual returns on invested sums of Rs. 1-2 crores.  
With three substantial income sources established, your combined monthly income would comfortably surpass Rs. 1 crore with potential for further scaling up in coming years. Financial freedom requires consistent effort but is well within reach through such a multidimensional approach.
