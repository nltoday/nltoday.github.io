### Photographic Evidence of Change Over Time 
As photography became more widespread in the late 19th century, it allowed us to capture glimpses of life in cities throughout different eras. Looking back through photographs from the 1800s to early 1900s provides fascinating before-and-after comparisons to modern times. Let's take a virtual tour through some landmark urban locations as seen through the lens of history.

### # Paris, France 
Paris was an early adopter of the new photographic technology, with photos dating back to the 1860s showing its famed architecture and bustling streets. Two turn-of-the-century images from 1902 and 1914 depict scenes that have likely changed little outwardly - the Eiffel Tower continues to tower over the City of Light, and outdoor markets still line the pavements. However, life has evolved dramatically, as shown in a 1917 photo of a young girl holding a doll amidst soldier's equipment, remnants of World War I's impact on the city. Today, over a century later, Paris retains its old-world charm while embracing modernity.
### # Berlin, Germany  
A 1910 photo offers a glimpse of Berlin during the German Empire era under Wilhelm II. Horse-drawn carriages rumble down cobbled roads past architecture representative of the period. The city underwent immense upheaval after World War I and the rise of the Nazi regime, culminating in its division during the Cold War. Reunification in 1990 heralded a new chapter, and Berlin has since revitalized into a vibrant cultural and economic hub. Through it all, the spirit of this northern European powerhouse has endured.
### # London, England
Depicted in an 1893 photo, the bustling streets of London showcase Victorian-era fashions and transportation. Just a few decades later, the city endured aerial bombings during World War II. In 2022, London remains one of the world's foremost financial centers and a global cultural melting pot. Iconic sites like Big Ben and Buckingham Palace stand as symbols of Britain's far-reaching influence. Despite wars and social changes, London has maintained its status as one of the most historically significant cities on the planet.
### A Glimpse into Diverse Regions
The rapid global spread of photography in the late 19th/early 20th centuries allows us an unprecedented view into communities worldwide at a pivotal moment in history. A selection of images provide a snapshot into iconic locations across diverse regions.
### # East Asia
Beijing, China circa 1910 shows traditional architecture and modes of transport unchanged for centuries. A photo of Tokyo, Japan from around 1880 portrays the period following the Meiji Restoration, which modernized the country after long isolation. Both cities have since transformed into futuristic global economic powerhouses while preserving cultural heritage. 
### # Southeast Asia  
Jakarta, Indonesia in 1885 highlights the colonial influence of the Dutch East India Company years before independence. Today, Jakarta stands as Indonesia's epicenter of [political and economic activity](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-santa-christmas-tree-lights-funny-xmas-pajama-boys-426-chihuahua-dog).
### # Middle East
Istanbul, Turkey circa 1890-1900 captures a bustling waterfront market at the peak of the Ottoman Empire. Now Turkey's most populous city, Istanbul straddles both Europe and Asia as a vital **cultural, economic and geopolitical center**.
### # South Asia
Images from the late 1800s showcase Karachi, Pakistan and Mumbai (then Bombay), India under British rule as colonial port towns. Both have since grown into sprawling metropolises and remain pivotal to their respective nations.
### # The Americas
One of the earliest US photographs, circa 1900, portrays Manhattan's bustling streets not long after elevation of structures like the Brooklyn Bridge transformed urban infrastructure. Over a century on, NYC stands as one of the premier global cities, a center for business, culture and innovation.
### Advances in Transportation and Technology 
The early 20th century was a period of unprecedented technological progress and innovation which would heavily impact the way people moved and lived. A selection of photos capturing some of these transformative milestones:
- May 1918 saw the first successful US airmail delivery flight between New York and Washington DC, marking the fledgling years of air travel.
- Circa 1911, the Lightning Benz in Germany set land speed records, epitomizing the "Golden Age of Motoring" as automobiles grew in popularity and ability. 
- From 1926, American scientist Robert Goddard pioneered modern rocketry, laying the foundation for future space exploration and satellite technologies reshaping our worldview.
### Enduring Challenges of Warfare
Sadly, war brought immense suffering across two world conflicts during this era. A touching 1917 image from Paris shows a Canadian soldier kindly assisting a wounded German enemy, highlighting our shared humanity even in times of division. Such scenes endured on battlefields from Europe to the Middle East, leaving deep scars but forging international cooperation in future decades. Over a century on, may lessons be learned.
In conclusion, glimpses into iconic urban areas from the late 1800s to early 1900s via photographs provide extraordinary before-and-after comparisons to the modern world. While conflicts and upheavals impacted communities, the human experience of family, commerce and cultural heritage has endured across diverse geographies. Today, while new technologies reshape our daily lives at warp speed, such historic images serve as poignant reminders of our shared past as people navigating an ever-evolving world.
