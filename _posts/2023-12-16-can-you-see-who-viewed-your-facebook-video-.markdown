Video content is a powerful way to engage audiences on Facebook. As a creator, you likely want to understand who is watching and engaging with your videos. This comprehensive guide breaks down how to see viewers for different types of Facebook videos, including posts, stories, and live streams.
### Analytics for Video Posts 
Video posts on your Facebook profile or page behave similarly to images or other regular posts. [You cannot view a list of individual viewers](https://store.fi.io.vn/women-happy-halloween-shirts-pug-dog-happy-hallothanksmas-1), but Facebook provides some analytics. To see overall viewership for your videos, log into Facebook via desktop and navigate to your profile. Click "Videos" then "Your Videos" to view numbers. 
The view counter below each video only increments after 3 seconds of playback. For deeper **insights like demographics and regions**, business pages have access to Facebook Creator Studio with additional metrics. While you can't identify specific viewers, Creator Studio helps optimize future video content.

### Viewer Counts for Facebook Live  
Facebook Live lets you broadcast in real-time to your audience. **While streaming live, a viewer counter displays the current number watching.** You can also see any comments or reactions in real-time. However, after finishing the broadcast, Live videos act like normal posts with no individual viewer data. 
Leverage the live engagement to build an audience before your stream ends. Make sure to prompt viewers to like and comment to track engagement later. Live video is ideal for timely topics that prompt discussion during the broadcast.
### Identifying Story Video Viewers
Story videos disappear after 24 hours but let you see who watched. After uploading a video story, tap the viewer count in the lower left. **A list of all profiles who viewed your story will appear,** allowing you to identify interested audiences. 
Stories offer a less permanent format for testing different types of video content. The viewer list gives insight into what content or topics resonate most with your connections. Consider replicating successful story videos as regular posts or live streams to extend their reach.
### Optimizing Video Content for Facebook 
Facebook provides some analytics to understand video viewership depending on format. **While you cannot view individual profiles for regular posts or past live videos, stories uniquely allow identifying viewers.** 
Consider testing different content in stories before cross-promoting to longer formats. Live video fosters real-time discussion but stories reveal interested audiences. Leverage Facebook insights along with external analytics to strengthen video strategies over time. The right content in the proper format keeps viewers engaged.
