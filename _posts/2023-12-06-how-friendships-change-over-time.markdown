## Start of our journey together
We met in high school and immediately bonded over our love of trashy TV shows and complaints about our parents. As teenagers often do, we thought our parents were so uncool and just didn't understand us. However, we understood each other and that built a strong foundation for our friendship. 
After graduating high school, we went our separate ways for college but stayed close friends. We made sure to make time for each other between classes and introduced each other to people at our new schools. During breaks, we would get together and catch up on all the latest drama from our lives. As many young women experience, we commiserated over crappy ex-boyfriends and agreed that [men can be so annoying sometimes](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-jack-chi-dog-bacon-lover-t-chihuahua-dog). Through it all, we had each other to lean on.
### Finding love 
In college, I met someone who really swept me off my feet. He treated me well and we had an instant connection. I was thrilled to introduce my best friend to him and hoped she would be as happy for me as I was. However, that's not what happened. Instead of supporting my new relationship, she constantly picked apart little things about my boyfriend and his interactions with me. It hurt that she couldn't just be pleased that I found someone who made me happy.

### Drifting apart
As time went on, our lives began moving in different directions. I got engaged to my college sweetheart while she had broken up with her long-term partner. When I told her my exciting news, she made it all about how lonely she now felt. She even bailed on being my maid of honor right before the wedding. Though I was sad, I tried to be understanding of her heartache. Little did I know, this was just the beginning of us growing apart. 
## Changing perspectives 
### Resentment grows
A few years after our weddings, the cracks in our friendship became more apparent. Whenever I brought up plans with my husband, like having kids, she would become very negative. It seemed she now resented any happiness in my relationship. The last straw was when she openly told me that she **hated my husband and wished I had never married him**. I was shocked that someone who had supposedly been my best friend could say something so cruel.
### Realizing the truth 
In retrospect, I see how her own insecurities sabotaged our friendship. Whenever my life was going well, she would find ways to put me down or make things about her instead of being happy for me. Her jealousy grew each time I achieved something she hadn't. While she was going through hard times, I had tried to be understanding. However, there comes a point when someone lets their bitterness poison a friendship. Though it was difficult to accept, I realized our close bond just wasn't there anymore.
### Moving on 
Ending a long-term friendship is never easy, even if it has run its course. There will always be fond memories of our carefree teenage years and all we shared over the past decade. However, people change and not always for the better. With time and space, I've accepted that people grow apart and relationships evolve. Now, I focus on surrounding myself with positive people who celebrate each other's successes instead of finding ways to undermine them. While it was sad to lose a friend, I feel liberated without that negativity in my life anymore.
## Happier times ahead
### A new chapter 
After leaving behind years of friendship that had turned toxic, I felt ready for a fresh start. My husband was very supportive through it all and helped lift my spirits. I took the chance to reconnect with old friends who had faded to the background before. To my delight, catching up with them felt entirely natural as if no time had passed at all. With their encouragement, I decided to pursue my dream of starting my own **small business in interior design**.
### Future looks bright
It has been rewarding to finally cut ties with the negativity and jealousy that had creeped into my longest friendship. Moving forward with positivity and surrounding myself with uplifting people is far better for my mental health and happiness. While I wouldn't wish ill on my ex-friend, I don't miss the way she used to find ways to put me down. Now, I'm excited to see what this new chapter in life and career has in store. With loving people by my side, I know the best is yet to come.
