### What Happens When You Install an Android Update
When you install an Android system update on your device, it replaces the existing OS version with the new updated version. This involves modifying core system files and making changes to the device's firmware. Once the update is complete, the previous OS version is no longer present on the phone. While Android updates aim to improve functionality, security and performance, they don't always go smoothly for every user. Some people face issues after installing major OS updates.

### Why You May Want to Uninstall or Downgrade
There can be several valid reasons why a user may want to uninstall or downgrade from the recently installed Android update. The new OS version could be very [buggy](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/algarin) and **unstable**, introducing multiple app crashes, performance lags or heating issues. Some key features may stop working properly or get messed up. Battery life could take a severe hit. In rare cases, important hardware components like cameras may malfunction post-update. All this can negatively impact the user experience.
### Factory Resetting: A Simple Troubleshooting Step
One of the first things to try in case of update-related issues is a factory reset. This wipes all user-installed apps and data but keeps the system software intact. It resolves many software glitches by cleaning out corrupted app data or caches. To factory reset, go to Settings > System > Advanced > Reset options > Erase all data. Be sure to backup any crucial data beforehand. In some cases, a reset is enough to restore normal functionality.
### Downgrading Via Custom Recovery
If the issues persist even after a factory reset, the next logical step would be to **downgrade to the previous stable Android version**. However, regular users cannot directly uninstall or revert system updates on their phone. Here's where **custom recovery** comes into play. It is a low-level system component used for flashing firmware updates. By installing a custom recovery like TWRP on the phone, one gains the ability to browse and flash different OS versions. Users will need to manually download the firmware package for the desired older Android version and flash it using the custom recovery. The process requires special steps depending on the device model and voiding the warranty. It is not for the faint of heart but can help resolve major update bugs when nothing else works. 
### OEM Repair or Replacement Last Resort
If all troubleshooting fails and the phone remains unusable even after downgrading, it may be damage beyond repair. At this point, the best bet is to contact the original equipment manufacturer or authorized service centres for potential fix options. They could reflash the stock firmware or replace faulty hardware components, if detected. As a last resort, the OEM may offer a replacement unit depending on warranty coverage. However, this involves downtime, costs and no guarantees of success. Proper due diligence before major system updates can save such hassles down the line.
### Avoiding Update Troubles in the Future   
To prevent ending up in such unideal situations in the future, there are a few preventive measures users can take:
- Check online forums for early reports on a new update's stability before installing 
- Only install officially signed updates from the device settings menu
- Back up all important data to external storage beforehand  
- Consider pausing automatic updates if major version changes are underway
- Factory reset after major OS upgrades to wipe caches/bugs  
- Only update when the device is not low on storage space
With the right approach, users can minimize risks while benefitting from Android's frequent improvements over time. The tips shared here provide a guide to troubleshooting or rolling back in worse case scenarios.
