### Welcoming Smiles and Warm Greetings  
When I first moved to the United States from India, I was pleasantly surprised by how polite, respectful and friendly Americans were on a daily basis. Coming from a culture where random strangers don't typically interact, I found it remarkable that people would smile at me and wish me a good day without knowing me at all. Doormen would hold doors open as I walked by, and strangers said "thank you" and "sorry" for even the smallest things. [Cultural norms of courtesy and consideration](https://yt.io.vn/collection/abdi) seemed to be strongly ingrained in American society. 
As a pedestrian, I also appreciated how drivers would apply their brakes when they saw me near a crosswalk, even if I hadn't stepped out yet. Such **respect for pedestrian safety** starkly contrasted with the blaring horns and near-misses I was used to in India. Speaking more slowly due to English being my second language, Americans listened patiently and allowed me to fully express myself without interruption. Not once did anyone mock my pronunciation or grammar mistakes.

### Academic Support for International Students  
Adjusting to the American education system also presented initial difficulties, as the theoretical Indian model I was accustomed to differed significantly from the practical focus here. However, all of my professors at university went above and beyond to help me succeed. They provided extensive reference materials and allowed me to sit in on undergraduate courses at no cost, helping clarify concepts I struggled with. Such **dedication to student success** shone through during my early semesters adjusting to the new system. 
### A Lack of Racism and an Abundance of Help
Contrary to stereotypes I had heard, I have never personally experienced racism or hatred as a foreigner living in the United States. Quite the opposite - people are always eager to lend a helping hand if I appear confused or need assistance navigating an unfamiliar situation as a newcomer to the country and culture. Neighbors, colleagues, acquaintances - all exude kindness, open-mindedness and a willingness to aid those around them. This level of compassion and ** civic-mindedness** toward immigrants contrasts starkly with negative portrayals sometimes presented in foreign media.
### The Positive Impact of American Friendliness  
Interacting regularly with such warm, considerate Americans has made me strive to emulate their good qualities and pay kindness forward. Now, I instinctively hold doors, pick up dropped items and offer help to those who appear lost or struggling - lessons learned from living here. These values of **courtesy, compassion and community** have also shaped how I wish to raise my young daughter, born an American citizen. I hope the qualities exemplified daily, such as friendliness to strangers, consideration for others and eagerness to assist those in need, become inherent aspects of her character as well.
### Confirming Stereotypes, or Challenging Them? 
Interestingly, the only truly friendly foreigners my wife and I encountered during our honeymoon in Mauritius years ago happened to be American. Could their polite, smiley demeanor really have revealed their nationality from halfway across the world? Or does it simply refute common stereotypes associating rudeness with Americans? My brother's equally positive experiences with kindness from roommate and acquaintances during his studies in Montana further corroborate the gracious nature consistently shown to me as well in various regions of this enormous, diverse country. While no place is perfect, interactions with average Americans have undoubtedly left me with an impression of a remarkably welcoming, compassionate people.
### An Example for the World
In conclusion, the hospitality, consideration and helpfulness exhibited by so many towards immigrants, strangers and newcomers in the United States provides an exemplary model for other nations. In a fragmented world where division and intolerance sometimes gain traction, America shows that cultures of courtesy create cohesive, collaborative societies where people genuinely care for one another. I feel fortunate to call this place my adopted home and am grateful for the selfless acts of goodness that smooth my transition each day. Most of all, I appreciate the impact living here has had in cultivating compassion within myself to pay forward.
