The Bible that most Christians use today comes with some criticisms regarding translation errors and alleged missing verses. While no translation is perfect, an examination of the evidence shows that the overall meaning and message has been faithfully conveyed. 
## Evaluating the Evidence 
When analyzing claims of errors or missing text, it's important to evaluate the evidence objectively. [Textual scholars](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-summer-vintage3422-t-shirt) carefully examine the earliest biblical manuscripts in their original languages to determine the original text. Variations that exist in later manuscripts help trace the transmission history and pinpoint possible copying mistakes.
### Comparing Early Manuscripts
For the New Testament, manuscripts like the 4th century **Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus** provide our earliest and most complete records of the Greek text. When variations exist, earlier manuscripts are given more weight. Extant manuscripts are also compared to ancient Bibles translated into other languages like Latin, Syriac and Coptic for verification. This process allows scholars to reconstruct the autographs with a high degree of certainty.

## Assessing Specific Passages
Let's examine some specific passages that have been questioned. In most cases, the evidence suggests they were accidental additions rather than authentic text. 
### Mark's Longer Ending
The earliest Greek manuscripts, including Sinaiticus and Vaticanus, do not contain **Mark 16:9-20**. Scholars believe this was not original but a later attempt by copyists to harmonize Mark with the other Gospels. The abrupt ending at verse 8 was deemed too abrupt, so a longer ending was added.
### The Woman Caught in Adultery 
Similarly, **John 7:53-8:11** is deemed a later insertion. It is absent from the earliest papyri and uncial manuscripts. Likely an authentic saying of Jesus placed in the wrong location by copyists trying to harmonize the Gospels. Though historical, it was not originally part of John's Gospel. 
### 1 John 5:7-8 and the Trinity
The famous Trinitarian statement known as the **Comma Johanneum** is not found in any Greek manuscript until the 15th-16th centuries. Earlier witnesses lack this text, showing it was erroneously added later to support Trinitarian doctrine. However, its doctrine can still be supported from other passages.
## Assessing Whole Books
On the whole, no full book is considered missing from the New Testament. Any questioned passages were later additions, not original text, and the meaning is unaffected by their omission in careful translations. While translations have limitations, the integrity of the biblical manuscripts is remarkably intact. An objective examination of the evidence, guided by **textual scholarship**, continues to solidify how faithfully the original text has been preserved and translated for today's readers.
Over the coming chapters, we'll examine more specific examples of questioned passages, analyze how textual criticism works, and see why Christians can have confidence that the Bibles they read faithfully represent God's inspired Word.
