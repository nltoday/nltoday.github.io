### The Order of Eating  
*[Meals are meant to be shared experiences](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/adkinson)* rather than individual activities. In China, the eldest person at the table is served first as a sign of respect. Everyone waits for the oldest to begin eating before starting their own meals. Courtesy and consideration for others is shown by eating at a moderate pace, neither too fast nor too slow. Food should be brought to your rice bowl before consuming to avoid appearing ravenous or disrespectful with your chopsticks.

### Table Manners 
***Proper chopstick etiquette*** is important in Chinese dining. Avoid playing with or rubbing chopsticks together, and do not stick them straight up in your rice. Always hold them pointed down between bites. Use both hands whenever possible to serve others to demonstrate respect. **Public displays of affection are frowned upon** - save kissing and feeding each other for private moments. Refill drinks for those around you before serving yourself to be considerate. Eat slowly and enjoy your food instead of rushing through the meal.
### Communal Eating 
Meals in China are very much group activities. At hot pot gatherings, ***cooking food for the table rather than just yourself*** shows thoughtfulness. Dim sum is best experienced by passing dishes inward and ordering on behalf of others too. As the closest to serving platters, these diners should refill tea and participate in serving others. Splitting bills equally regardless of consumption is considered rude - each should pay according to what was ordered. Babies are doted on at the table so parents can enjoy their meals too. 
### Table Protocol 
***Spatial positioning carries meaning***. Do not rush to sit but allow the host to guide you respectfully. The inside and right sides imply seniority while the outside and left imply junior status. Keep all parts of your body above the table at all times - even leaning in to reach for something is taboo. Leave scraps like lettuce, carrot strands, or flowers on your plate since consuming garnishes is inappropriate. Spinning lazy susans should only be done after ensuring no one is reaching to select food. Slurping noodles and making appreciative noises while eating is normal and encouraged in China.
### Shared Meal Traditions
Potluck-style gatherings promote camaraderie through ***shared cooking and dining***. At hotpot parties for example, diners take turns preparing ingredients together in the simmering broth. This interactive cooking process fosters connection and celebrates diversity as various dishes are sampled. Meals taken with elders instill gratitude - do not insist on paying or it may come across as disrespect. Traditions like these have nourished Chinese families and communities through generations of shared meals and memories.
### Finishing the Meal
As the meal draws to an end, remember that ***leaving a clean plate*** signals enjoyment of the hostâ€™s hospitality. However, taking the last remaining serving is considered greedy unless specifically offered to you as a VIP guest. Although dining rooms are clearing, conversations often continue long after as companions linger over tea. Chinese food brings people together through rituals of nourishment, tradition and fellowship far beyond just refueling body and mind. Tableside camaraderie outlives individual appetites, making every meal much more than the sum of its flavors.
