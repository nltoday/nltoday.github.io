Emotionally detaching from someone you have feelings for can be incredibly difficult, but it's an important life skill to learn for your emotional and mental well-being. In this guide, we will go through the steps and strategies you need to use to successfully detach yourself emotionally and protect your heart.
### Take Physical Space First
The very first step is to put physical distance between you. This means no contacting them at all through calls, texts, emails, social media, or asking mutual friends about them. Complete physical detachment makes emotional detachment possible, as being in constant contact will keep reopening old wounds. While it may be hard, you need this clean break to fully heal and move on. 
You may have thoughts of remaining friends, but true friendship will not be possible for a long time, if ever. Both people need space and time apart to transition out of a romantic relationship mindset. Revisiting the relationship too soon often does more harm than good. Respect each other enough to go no contact for now.

### Grieve and Process Your Emotions
Denying your feelings will only drag out the process. Allow yourself time each day to feel whatever emotions arise - sadness, anger, regret. But avoid getting stuck there. Spend this time with supportive friends and family who can offer a compassionate ear and a shoulder to cry on. Expressing what's on your mind and in your heart helps release bottled up feelings. 
A change of scenery through travel, even just for a weekend, can do wonders. An overnight getaway, short solo vacation, or visiting others in a new place provides a welcomed distraction and shift in mental energy. Sunshine, fresh air, and novel experiences stimulate positivity and renewal.
### Fill Your Time with Self-Care and New Pursuits
Taking on a long-term **"bold_hobby"**, such as learning an instrument, training for an athletic event, or volunteering your skills, engages your mind productively. Pouring energy into bettering yourself and helping others through acts of service boosts self-worth and fosters gratitude.
Other tactics like redecorating your living space, getting a haircut or new glasses, decluttering your home, or upgrading your wardrobe through retail therapy empower you to rewrite your personal story - the next chapter is yours to author. Small transformations mirror internal growth. 
### Limit Social Media Use 
Resist temptation to cyberstalk them or lurk on mutual friends' pages hoping for relationship status updates. Over-exposure to their online persona reopens attachment wounds. Take a temporary social media fast if needed. Out of sight, out of mind, out of heart.
### Redirect Your Emotions
Acknowledge that you have so much love still within you, ready to be given. Redirect that love towards caring for yourself through acts of self-compassion. Nurture platonic relationships by checking in on friend in your support circle. Express gratitude for what you do have. With time and effort, you have the power to detach emotionally from someone and redirect your energy to more positive outlets.
### Accept You Will Have Setbacks
Healing isn't linear. On harder days, allow gentle self-care through comfort foods, cozy activities at home, or just extra sleep. Notice negative thought patterns and consciously redirect. Be patient through this transition. With each passing month, the hurt dulls and fond memories fade, replaced by new milestones and adventures ahead. Stay determined yet kind to yourself throughout this journey of recovery.
### Move Forward with Hope for the Future  
One day soon, you'll realize weeks have gone by without crying over them. Trigging songs no longer sting. Fond memories bring a smile, not tears. Be proud of how far you've come. Continue investing in your future self - relationships ahead may surprise you in the happiest ways. With emotional detachment comes freedom, growth and renewed optimism for what's to follow.
The road to healthy detachment takes perseverance and self-compassion, but protecting your heart is worth the effort. Be gentle yet determined. Have faith that in time, you will regain emotional independence and emerge even stronger. Focus on you - your well-being, happiness and future are what really matter most. This too shall pass, so keep going one day at a time.
