## Tracking Game Prices Across Stores
As digital game platforms like [Steam game sale tracker](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-crazy-beagle-lady-dog-lover-v-neck-t-shirt/men&) provide, there are a few websites that help gamers keep track of game prices across different stores. IsThereAnyDeal is a popular service for this as it tracks historical game prices on Steam along with other stores like Humble Bundle, Fanatical, GOG and more. Users can add games to their wishlist and get notified via email when a sale happens. 
The site also shows price history which can help determine if waiting for a bigger sale is worthwhile. For example, a game may occasionally get 20-30% off but during major seasonal events it could drop to 50% or more. Having the historical data available allows making an informed purchase decision. Besides IsThereAnyDeal, other trackers like DekuDeals (for Nintendo Switch games) and Psprices (for PlayStation games) offer similar tracking features tailored to their respective platforms.
### Timing Game Purchases for Major Steam Sales  
Steam holds several major sales throughout the year that coincide with different seasons. The **Steam fall sale** usually takes place around late October or early November which lines up with Halloween. Following that is the massive **Steam winter sale** in late December through early January to encompass the Christmas and New Year period. In the summer, there is the **Steam summer sale** between June and July. Lastly, there is typically a spring sale sometime between March and May. 
During these major events, thousands of games go on significant discounts, with many titles seeing their lowest historical prices. It's not uncommon for even newer AAA games to get 50% off or more. Waiting for these big sales before making non-urgent game purchases can result in substantial savings.

## Other Digital Stores Follow Steam's Lead
Steam's massive seasonal sales tend to influence pricing strategies on other major PC game retailers as well. When Steam kicks off their winter or summer sale, sites like **Epic Games Store**, GOG, Origin, Uplay, and digital storefronts on consoles usually run complementary promotions. 
While the discounts may not be as deep, competition ensures players have options. **Epic Games Store game sale** in particular tries to undercut Steam by offering bigger discounts or entirely free games during their sales windows. Using a price tracking site, savvy customers can always pick up a game from wherever it's least expensive between Steam and all other outlets.
### Weekly and Midweek Deals Beyond Major Events  
Between Steam's giant seasonal sales are occasional smaller sales and midweek/weekend promotions. The **"Steam midweek madness"** promotion runs every Tuesday where they feature selected indie games at steeper than normal discounts for the week. Subscribing to Steam's newsletter ensures not missing out on these bite-sized deals.
Likewise, other storefronts try luring in customers with routine daily deals, weekend bargains, or publisher-themed sales. For instance, fans should watch out for Bandai Namco, Ubisoft, or Capcom publisher weeks on Steam for deeper discounts on their games. Setting up deal alerts on a price tracking site takes the homework out of manually checking stores.
## Game Bundles - A Cost-Effective Option  
While individual game deals attract the most attention, another thrifty method of building up one's game library is through bundles. Sites like **Humble Bundle** and Fanatical routinely offer curated bundles packing multiple games - often with big name titles - at extremely low fixed prices or pay-what-you-want models. 
The games come as redeemable keys for activation on respective platforms like Steam. Forinstance, a bundle may package 10+ indie or older AAA games worth $250 together but be available for just $15. For patient gamers, bundles provide a fun way to try different genres on a limited budget. Some bundles also donate a portion of sales to charity.
### Deal Alerts from Trackers and Third-Party Apps
Beyond visiting deal sites like IsThereAnyDeal manually, there are ways to stay automatically updated. Many trackers let users create watchlists of desired games then send notifications by email or through their websites/apps. Alternately, third-party apps like **Razer Cortex** sync with Steam wishlists to push local desktop alerts for price drops.
The set-it-and-forget convenience of these services removes the work of constantly trawling stores. They effectively serve up good deals on a digital platter. Between bundles, trackers, routine sales, and major events, PC gamers now have more options than ever to build up a backlog affordably without missing out on savings. Proper planning and utilizing deal alerts ensure lining one's pockets instead of game publishers' during purchases.
# In Conclusion 
As covered above, there are plenty of opportunities throughout the year for PC gamers to save big on games. Major Steam seasonal sales remain the heavyweights due to their scale. However, smaller, more frequent promotions on Steam and beyond warrant regular monitoring. Sites like IsThereAnyDeal excel at this by surfacing deals across stores with price history. 
Bundling several games together at basement prices is another cost-effective strategy employed by top bundle sites. Lastly, deal trackers and third-party apps like Razer Cortex that integrate with Steam wishlists deliver a set-it-and-forget convenience. With a variety of online discount sources and deal alerts, budget-conscious players need never pay full price and can steadily build their backlogs for much less. Proper research and a sales-aware mentality ensures making the most out of deep PC game deals all year round.
