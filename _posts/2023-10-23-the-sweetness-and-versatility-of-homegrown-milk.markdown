### Nourishing from Newborn to Elderly
Raw milk from small farms is a nutrient-dense food that can nourish humans across all life stages, from infants to the elderly. Containing a complete set of vitamins, minerals, proteins and fats, milk is one of few foods that could feasibly sustain a human from birth through old age alone. The author recalls drinking raw milk with every meal as a child on local farms, where it was the centerpiece of pies, cakes, breads and more.

### Preference for Jersey Milk and Goat's Milk  
Of the milk from Holstein, Guernsey and Jersey cows on surrounding farms, the author's favorite was always Jersey milk for its creaminess and sweetness akin to drinking liquid ice cream. Goat's milk from the author's own Nubian herd is similarly sweet while being **naturally homogenized creamy**. Though difficult for butter production, goat milk separates less in the carton than cow milk.
### Home-Raised Animals and Hand-Milked Raw Milk
The author will not drink store-bought milk due to its inferior taste and opts to hand-milk their own Jersey cows instead. This provides milk that is higher in calories and nutrients to fuel the labor of the farm. Excess milk also nourishes chickens and dogs on the homestead. **Freshly hand-milked farm milk**.
### Versatile Milk Product Creation
Beyond drinking milk, the author utilizes it to create yogurt, ghee and cheese when production exceeds consumption. **Homemade dairy versatile**. This value-adds to the raw materials and avoids waste, providing more nutrition from the same source. 
### Transforming Brush into Sweet Creamy Milk
A photo shows one of the author's Nubian dairy goats filling up on leaves, sticks, blackberry bushes and poison ivy - plants most animals cannot digest. Yet goats transform this "brush" into delicious, creamy milk through their specialized stomachs. **Goat milk nutritional magic**. This is a feat modern science has not replicated in creating a complete food from low-value feedstuffs.
### Regional Raw Milk Varieties 
Having sampled milk from Holsteins, Guernseys, Jerseys and various goat breeds on neighboring farms, the author became very familiar with the flavors between dairy animals. Regional milk differs significantly from mass-produced brands. **Farm-fresh regional milk flavor**. Those seeking superior taste should obtain raw milk directly from small farm producers versus homogenized store brands.
### Human Milk Comparison
While nourishing, the author notes human milk tastes slightly thinner and fruitier than cow or goat milk due to its higher sugar content. Yet breastmilk differs greatly from even the best raw dairy cows or goats. **Breastmilk superior sweetness**. Mothers provide a perfectmilk uniquely suited for infants in both nutrients and flavor.
