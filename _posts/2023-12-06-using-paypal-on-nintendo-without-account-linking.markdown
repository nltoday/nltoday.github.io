## An Indirect Way to Add Funds 
One of the conveniences of PayPal is the ability to add funds to your Nintendo account without needing to input credit card information. However, recently Nintendo has required linking a PayPal account to complete purchases from the eShop. For those wishing to avoid this, there are still [indirect alternatives](https://store.fi.io.vn/funny-xmas-this-is-my-christmas-pajama-heartbeat-video-game-98/women&).
### Purchasing Digital Gift Cards
The most straightforward option is to purchase digital Nintendo eShop gift cards. These can be found on sites like **Amazon.com** with a wide selection of denominations available. Once purchased, the gift card code simply needs to be redeemed on the Nintendo website or console to add the funds to your account balance. This allows making purchases without any account linking. Gift cards are very user-friendly and protect financial information.

## Redeeming Physical Cards
For those who prefer physical gift cards, these can still be utilized as well. Cards can be found for sale at most major retailers like Walmart, Target, GameStop and more. The card contains a redeem code on the back that is entered on the Nintendo site or device just like a digital code. One advantage of physical cards is they can make great gifts that don't require the recipient to input their payment details. Just the code is all that's needed to access the funds.
### Recommended Retailers
When shopping for either digital or physical Nintendo eShop gift cards, there are a few retailers that tend to offer especiallycompetitive prices and purchase options. ***Amazon*** is a top choice thanks to their widespreadavailability of both physical and digital formats along with fast shipping. For physical cards, looking at discount retailers like ***Walmart*** can sometimes find better deals than specialized gaming shops. Prices should always be compared across multiple sellers before settling on a purchase. Deals can vary so it's worth taking a few extra minutes to scan options.
## Anonymously Adding Funds with Cash
For those looking for an even more private method to add Nintendo funds, relying on cash may be a good fit. Several retailers like ***GameStop*** allow redeeming gift cards purchased with cash instead of credit cards. The customer simply buys the physical gift card from the storefront with bills and coins then redeems the included code. No accounts need be connected at all since only the money was exchanged, not personal information. It's one of the most anonymous means of loading an eShop balance.
### Additional Cash Purchase Methods 
A few other cash reload options exist beyond GameStop cards. Services like ***PayNearMe*** permit paying cash to load funds onto gift cards from various brands at convenient locations like convenience stores and pay centers. The recipient would then redeem the gift card code on the desired platform like Nintendo. Finally, certain retailers may enable adding cash directly to an existing gift card balance in-store without needing to purchase a new card. Always checking for these kinds of flexible cash payment alternatives preserves privacy.
## Alternative Digital Wallet Options
While PayPal linking may now be required on Nintendo, other digital wallet services can still be utilized without connecting accounts. Both ***Apple Pay*** and ***Google Pay*** allow loading funds then using those balances on eligible consoles instead of linking bank details. For example, on Switch an Apple Pay balance can be used to purchase games and subscriptions from the Nintendo eShop app. These recognized payment services maintain anonymity compared to directly inputting financial information.
### Compatible Devices and Consoles 
When considering digital wallets, itâ€™s important to confirm the option is supported on the target device or console. Apple Pay works seamlessly on iOS devices as well as Switch. Google Pay functions smoothly on Android phones and tablets for Nintendo-compatiblepurchases. However, neither program is usable for Windows or non-mobile systems at this time without some workaround. Carefully checking cross-compatibility first avoids potential issues down the line. With preparation, trusted digital wallets can privately fund Nintendo accounts as needed.
## Maintaining Privacy with Prepaid Cards
For users seeking the most discretion possible, prepaid debit cards may offer the strongest financial anonymity on Nintendo. Unlike reloading existing accounts, prepaid cards behave more like physical cash with no holder name or lengthy money trail. Many major brands like ***Visa*** and ***Mastercard*** produce these single-use cards that can be purchased with cash. Funds are then added during the purchase process.
### Where to Buy Prepaid Cards
The two primary locations to obtain prepaid cards using cash are major retailers and online resellers. Brick and mortar stores like ***Walmart*** and ***Target*** stock cards from major networks near the front registers. Online, suppliers such as ***PrepaidGiftbalance*** sell an array of Visa, Mastercard, and other branded cards that ship quickly after ordering with cash by mail. Either channel supplies the needed prepaid card to privately spend within Nintendo's digital ecosystem without sharing currency sources.
In summary, various retailers, alternative digital services, and prepaid resources provide discreet means of adding funds to Nintendo accounts beyond direct PayPal linking. With a bit of flexibility and research into valid cash payment and reload options, user privacy can still be prioritized.
