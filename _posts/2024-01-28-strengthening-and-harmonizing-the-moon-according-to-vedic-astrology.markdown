### Understanding the Moon in Vedic Astrology
The moon occupies a place of great importance in Vedic astrology. Known as Chandra in Sanskrit, the moon represents the mind, emotions, desires, and experiences of an individual. It governs the [subtle body](https://store.fi.io.vn/dear-person-behind-me-you-look-great-today) and determines one's basic nature according to the sign and nakshatra of the moon at birth. As the moon is closely connected with water, issues relating to fluid balance in the body and communication are reflected by one's relationship with the water element. The moon also oversees sleep and various **meditative hypnotic** states.

### Signs of an Afflicted Moon
An afflicted or weak moon can manifest in various **negative qualities**.

Specific foods, herbs, activities and items associated with the moon can be incorporated as remedies when practiced regularly. Consuming milky foods like rice, coconut, cheese and almonds supports the moon, as does spending time near water bodies in nature. Herbs like mint and lemon balm soothe the mind and mood. Wearing silver, pearls or moonstones after consultation with an astrologer and meditating on the moon yantra strengthen its signification when weak.

Adorning white or silvery clothing crafted from natural fibers and wearing modest attire honors the inner moon's light. Channelling artistic talents through crafts, dance or music soothes lunar consciousness.
