### Physical Inspection 
The first step is to do a physical inspection of the fabric. [Check the packaging label](https://store.fi.io.vn/mommysaurus-mom-mom-2-kids3091-t-shirt) - if it mentions being wrinkle-free or easy care, it's likely a blend. Pure cotton can shrink and requires ironing. Examine the **feel and drape of the material** - cotton has a soft, breathable texture while blends may feel stiffer or less breathable. Look closely at the **weave structure** under light - cotton has a loose, airy weave whereas blends have tighter weaves to maintain shape. Physical clues on the packaging and fabric itself can provide early indications of cotton versus blends.

### Evaluate Care Requirements
The care requirements listed on the label and fabric content also provide insight. **Cotton-only fabrics** can often be **machine washed and dried** but may shrink, whereas blends designed to keep their shape can usually be **tumble dried on low heat or line dried.** Pure cotton often needs ironing to remove wrinkles while blends are meant to **resist wrinkling and creasing.** Consider wash/dry methods and whether ironing is required - low-maintenance needs point to blend content versus high-maintenance suggesting pure cotton. Care instructions shed light on fiber composition.
### Test Fabric Behavior with Water
Another simple method is testing the fabric's reaction to water. With a **clean cotton swatch,** wet your fingertip and smooth over the material - cotton should feel soft and supple when damp. Now try the same with a suspected blend. If the **fabric feels coarser when wet,** it contains non-cotton fibers meant to maintain structure when damp like polyester. To confirm, wipe your wet finger on a towel and rub it over the swatch again - cotton regains its soft hand while blends stay coarser. Water behavior between soaked cotton versus blend reveals differences.
### Check Thread Burn Test Results 
For a more conclusive test, conduct the thread burn method. Carefully pull or cut several **loose threads from a seam or hem** to avoid damaging the garment. Twist the cotton fibers tightly together to make a thin cord. Do the same with suspected blend threads. Then, **lightly burn each thread strand with a match or lighter.** **Pure cotton burns cleanly** to a soft fluffy ash, whereas synthetic blends like polyester leave small plastic beads. Examine residue closely - beads indicate non-cotton content while clean ash means a cotton-only fabric. The thread burn test provides definitive proof of fiber types.
### Evaluate Talcum Powder Absorption 
Another fabric testing method involves talcum powder. Find a **small inside fabric patch that won't be seen** when damp, like inside a hem or seam. **Rub a little talcum powder onto the area using your thumb.** Let it sit for a minute, then wipe clean with a damp cloth or finger. **Pure cotton absorbs the powder evenly** while non-absorbent synthetics like polyester leave a powdery residue that doesn't fully wipe away. Evaluate powder absorption - complete absorption suggests cotton content versus residue meaning blends or synthetics. Talcum testing identifies absorbency differences between natural and man-made fibers. 
### Perform the Burn Test 
For fabrics you don't want to damage, the burn test provides a non-destructive method to positively identify fiber content. Find a small inside seam, hem or tag corner to avoid noticeable burning. **Light a match or candle flame** and carefully hold the fabric edge in the flame for 5-10 seconds until it catches fire. **Cotton burns cleanly to soft white ash without fueling further flame.** Synthetics like polyester leave small plastic-like beads as residue. Examine burn patterns - cotton ash confirms pure cotton while plastic beads point to blends. Though potentially risky, the fabric burn test provides an easy definitive way to uncover fiber composition secrets.
### Analyze Fabric Under Magnification
For accurate identification of very similar-looking fabrics, use macro photography or a magnifying glass. The **microscopic weave structure** and individual **fiber cross-sections** reveal unique differences between cotton and blends. Under 10x magnification or more, the round cross-section and spiraled shape of **pure cotton is distinguishable** from the compact oval or amorphous appearance of synthetics. Evaluate texture up close - naturally spiraled cotton fibers versus uniform synthetic shapes indicate pure versus blended fabrics. Macro analysis exposes hidden compositional secrets invisible to the naked eye.
Determining fabric composition provides insight to care requirements, performance characteristics and sourcing. Various testing techniques analyze fiber behaviors, burn residue, absorption properties and microscopic structures to definitively identify cotton versus synthetic blends. Combining visual inspection, wash trials and scientific identification methods uncovers the true composition of any textile. An informed analysis empowers consumers to care for fabrics properly and make sustainable purchasing choices.
