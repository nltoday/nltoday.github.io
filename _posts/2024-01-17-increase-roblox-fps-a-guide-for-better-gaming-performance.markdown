Roblox has a default frame rate cap of 60 frames per second (FPS) to match older monitors. But many newer monitors support higher refresh rates. By unlocking the FPS cap, you can take advantage of 120Hz or 144Hz displays for smoother gameplay. In this guide, we'll discuss various ways to boost Roblox performance and FPS, including settings tweaks, hardware upgrades, and using an FPS unlocker.
### Hardware Basics
Integrated graphics like Intel HD Graphics will struggle to run Roblox at high FPS. Look for a [dedicated graphics card](https://store.fi.io.vn/french-bulldog-frenchie-dog-black-dog-lover-frenchies-1) like Nvidia or AMD that provides dedicated VRAM. Also, Roblox recommends at least 4GB of system RAM, though more will allow better multitasking. As for the processor, try for an Intel Core i3/i5 or Ryzen 3/5 and above for acceptable performance.

### Graphic Settings Optimization  
In the Roblox launcher, click the gear icon to access graphic settings. Lowering settings like Graphics Quality, Terrain, Sky, and View Distance can give a significant FPS boost, especially on lower-end PCs. **Test different preset levels** like "Automatic", "Best Performance", and "Beautiful" to find the optimal balance of visuals and frame rate for your specs. 
### Boost Performance with an **"FPS Unlocker"**
Many players use the popular **RBXFPSUnlocker** available on GitHub to uncap the frame rate. Simply download the executable, allow it through your antivirus, and adjust the FPS limit as desired in the system tray. This lets higher-refresh displays run at their full potential. However, on older hardware, pushing beyond 60 FPS may cause instability without a real benefit.
### Upgrade Your Hardware Gradually
Minor tweaks can only go so far - eventually hardware will need an upgrade. Consider a used graphics card first if your budget is tight. Also, adding more system memory improves frame rate consistency in complex games and servers. A solid state drive (SSD) replaces slow hard disks for snappier load times too. Finally, evaluate your CPU - a modern quad-core likely performs much better than previous dual-core models.
### Monitor Refresh Rate Fundamentals  
Most standard desktop monitors are 60Hz, refreshing the display 60 times per second. But 120Hz and 144Hz monitors refresh twice and 2.4 times faster, yielding a smoother visual experience. **If your display supports 120Hz or higher, an FPS unlocker allows taking advantage of that capability.** However, upgrading the monitor alone without capable hardware won't magically boost performance.
### Check Network Settings and Latency  
Network issues can cause stuttering, lag, and reduce FPS. Ensure you have a fast, wired Ethernet connection whenever possible for optimal ping times. If WiFi is necessary, use the 5GHz band for less interference. Also look at router settings, try different channels, and consider upgrading network hardware for notable improvements in **online gameplay experiences**.
### Troubleshoot with the Roblox Developer Hub
For persistent performance problems, check the Roblox Developer Hub for known issues, fixes, and optimization advice from the source. They provide developer tools for monitoring stats like memory usage too. The community also shares performance tweaks on platforms like Reddit and YouTube. With some experimentation following this guide, most players should find ways to boost FPS and smooth out their Roblox gaming!
