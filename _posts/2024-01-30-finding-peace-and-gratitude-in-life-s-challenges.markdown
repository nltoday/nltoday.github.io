Hawai'i was a place of healing for me. After experiencing trauma and depression in Kansas, the islands brought me calm and confidence. Through embracing local culture and connecting with kind people, my severe PTSD eased. Even difficult times hold opportunity, if we open our hearts to life's lessons.
### A New Perspective 
Escaping hell left me thankful to reach paradise. What seemed problems became blessings once viewed through compassion. Comparable to native Hawaiians, Americans often act entitled where we should feel privileged. Suffering humbled me to see life's precious fragility. Each day merits gratitude however small our troubles seem.

### Restoring Your Soul
In green pastures and still waters, the Lord restores weary souls. Dark valleys appear less fearsome with His rod and staff as comfort. Recovery demands allowing goodness and mercy their work. Forces beyond our control shape us, so choose healing over bitterness. What cures one may wound another; have faith another path exists. Hardship passes but renewal lasts, if we make peace within.
### Modern Medicine's Miracles 
For eighteen years, a miracle drug has dramatically improved my condition and life. Prior to its invention, chronic pain ruled me. Now I feel restored and able to thrive each day. We enter illness, but it need not define us. Through supporting one another with compassion, medicine and faith combine to deliver us from hell on Earth. All possess strength for someone's struggle; share it freely as you've received gifts.
### Walking with Gratitude 
My cup overflows daily with blessings, however simply. In darkness' shadow, His light guides safely home. With problems small or great, give thanks just to draw breath. Compare struggles to what others bear, and your burden lightens. The past shapes but need not imprison us; each dawn brings opportunity to grow. Keep faith that goodness and mercy will see you through all your days, as they have thus far, and more. 
### Lessons from Suffering
Trauma tested but also taught me. It humbled arrogance and opened my eyes to life's fragility. Now I see hardship differently, through a lens of compassion. What once isolated connects me to others' experiences. Illness alone need not mean identity; we contain multitudes. Even pain holds purpose, if we embrace life's lessons with open and grateful hearts. May dark valleys strengthen rather than defeat the traveler passing through.
### Aloha, Hawai'i
This island gave me calm, confidence and love after years of turmoil. Leaving with profound thanks, I carry its lessons of healing, nature's peace and aloha's warmth. Comparable kindness from residents rekindled hope that goodness prevails. Though paths diverge, the spirit of this place stays folded in my soul. May its essence of renewal, community and gratitude uplift all who cross its shores in need of refuge and revival. A hui hou, Hawai'iâ€”until we meet again in paradise.
### Gratitude, the Constant
No matter life's challenges, gratitude remains constant. It lightens burdens and breathes hope into suffering. Where illness strikes or trauma wounds, thankfulness for each small blessing reminds us of resilience's power. As modern medicine performs miracles and faith walks with us through darkness, keeping a thankful heart keeps despair at bay. Every dawn brings promise that this too shall pass. So long as we remember to count gifts rather than grievances, goodness and mercy will surely follow us all our days.
