### Finding the Truth  
I grew up in a devout Muslim family and faithfully followed Islam for many years. **However, as I learned more about Christianity and Jesus, I began to question some things about my own religion that didn't sit right with me.** I admired figures like Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein as Islamic heroes, but when I studied Jesus, I saw He lived a perfect, sinless life — something no other religious founder has done. This discrepancy troubled me.

### Uncomfortable Exposure to Christianity
When my parents enrolled me in a Christian school for safety reasons, I felt very uneasy attending church services. **The lively singing and praising of Jesus shocked me, as I had been taught this was blasphemy in Islam.** However, being immersed in Christianity gave me a new perspective. I started comparing Jesus and Muhammad objectively. Jesus preached peace while Muhammad used violence — this conflict tore at my faith. 
### A Heart Won Over
The more I learned about Jesus' character and teachings, the more I admired Him. **He never forced His message on anyone or condoned harming unbelievers, unlike what I had been taught about Islam.** Jesus' perfection and tenderness captured my heart in a way Muhammad's imperfect humanity never had. I fell in love with Jesus and could no longer reconcile worshiping a sinful man like Muhammad. 
### Confiding in Trusted Relations
Once I understood Jesus was the Savior I wanted to follow, it was important to share this journey with others. **My wise grandmother encouraged me to tell my parents when ready and pray for their understanding.** Bracing myself, I revealed the truth and was relieved they didn't disown me, though disappointed. With time and prayer, even they grew more accepting of my [Christian belief system](https://store.fi.io.vn/funny-video-gamer-xmas-i-paused-my-game-to-be-here-christmas-24/women&) and faith in Christ.
### Witnessing Mass Evangelism  
A trip to Trinidad expanded my faith beyond anything I'd known. **Attending my first Christian "Crusade" rally, I glimpsed the immense global body of Christ.** Thousands publicly praised Jesus with an fervor Muslims reserve privately for Allah. This validated Christianity's life-changing power and community. Overwhelmed, I re-committed to Christ with fresh conviction.
### Finding Purpose After Tragedy  
Losing my young daughter suddenly challenged my faith in unthinkable ways. **Grieving parents**, we sought meaning in her signs that "God [had] just [taken] her." Her innocence reminded me most need earthly lifetimes to become God-ready, while she didn't. I realized our sanctification and God-given purposes remain unfinished—we must "determine to live for Him" each day.
### Jesus: The Author and Perfecter of Our Faith  
Studying Scripture and history, the facts converge that Jesus likely lived around 2022 years ago based on the Gregorian calendar's foundation in His estimated birth year. **Though scholars debate +/- a few years**, this helps place in context His life, ministry and Resurrection as the Way, Truth and Life for all humanity. JesusChrist offers purpose, hope and new life to anyone willing to follow Him through faith—as He has for me.
