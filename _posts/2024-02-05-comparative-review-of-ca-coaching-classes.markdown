Advanced Accounts is an important subject for aspiring Chartered Accountants in India. There are several coaching options available for this subject at different price points. Two of the prominent names in this space are Sarthak Sir and Praveen Sharma Sir. In this article, let us compare the teaching style and effectiveness of these two coaching institutes based on real student reviews and feedback.
### Quality over Cost 
While Sarthak Sir's lectures are more affordable due to their lower cost, students have complained about the poor quality of teaching despite accounting being a conceptual subject.
