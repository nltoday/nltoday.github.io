## Introduction
This is the story of my father's experience working as a contractor on a renovation project at Trump Tower in the 1990s. It provides insights into Donald Trump's business practices and character from someone who had direct dealings with him. 
### The Project Begins
My father's construction company was contracted by a Trump assistant to complete renovations at Trump Tower that had originally been started by another contractor. My father, a lifelong Republican, was excited for the opportunity to meet Trump, who he admired as a fellow "deal-maker". However, during their initial meeting, Trump was preoccupied with boasting about himself and name-dropping celebrities. He made inappropriate comments about his daughter and abruptly changed subjects, making it hard to follow what he was saying.

### Negotiating the Contract  
When they began discussing contract details, Trump immediately started arguing to lower costs and wages. My father explained the industry-standard terms in his original bid. Trump begrudgingly agreed to less than the standard 50% down payment that my father required to cover materials and expenses.   
### Completing the Work
My father's team worked diligently to fit Trump's demanding schedule. They finished the project early and to a high quality. However, two weeks after being told Trump was away, my father was unexpectedly served papers saying the work was subpar and Trump would not pay the remaining balance.
### The Lawsuit
For the next four years, my father spent time and money tied up in litigation as Trump's lawyers dragged out the case. Eventually he settled for just half of what was owed, after already losing money on the job once legal fees were deducted. It took over three years for my father to realize Trump had never intended to pay in full.
### Lessons Learned
The experience shattered my father's admiration of Trump and changed his business model. He now avoids speculative developer projects and focuses on reputable public sector work. The story provides a telling glimpse into Trump's history of dishonest business practices and bullying tactics to avoid paying contractors for work completed.
## Trump's Pattern of Stiffing Contractors  
Beyond my father's experience, there is a clear decades-long pattern of Trump failing to pay contractors for work once completed. Numerous reports and testimonials from other contractors detail similar experiences of doing high quality work for Trump, only to eventually be stalled or taken to court when pressing for final payment.
### Multiple Reports of Unpaid Contractors
Investigative journalists have uncovered [hundreds of documented cases](https://store.fi.io.vn/los-angeles-best-mom-best-mom-mothers-day-los-angeles-city645-t-shirt) of Trump refusing to pay contractors and eventually settling lawsuits for pennies on the dollar after years of litigation. These accounts span back to at least the 1980s involving everything from architecture, construction, landscaping to entertainment services. 
### Lawsuits Were Part of the Business Model
It is evident Trump used litigation and bankruptcy to avoid paying debts as a matter of course in his business dealings. For him, fully paying contractors was the exception, not the standard practice. He relied on the fact that legal battles would be too costly for most small businesses to pursue repayment in full.
### Lack of Integrity and Empathy  
While lucrative real estate deals were made on the backs of these contractors, many small family companies were bankrupted by Trump's refusal to honor agreed-upon contracts. His actions show a disturbing lack of integrity and empathy for others impacted by his business decisions. Hiring and not paying workers was simply another negotiation tactic for him.
## My Father's Awakening
Though initially a devoted Republican and Trump supporter, witnessing Trump's dishonesty and abuse of the legal system firsthand was a sobering awakening for my father. It took losing over a year of money and time to realize the type of person Trump truly was - careless of the hardship he inflicted on others to enrich himself. 
### Shattered Illusions About Trump 
The experience destroyed my father's illusions that Trump was some kind of folksy businessman like himself. He came to see Trump for who he has always been - an untrustworthy egomaniac who views people as disposable means to expand his wealth and fame. 
### Changed Views on Character and Leadership
Most impactfully, it altered my father's evaluation of what qualities make a good leader. Showing empathy, integrity and fairness in business dealings, even when legally allowed not to, became more important to him than partisan political positions. He now judges leadership candidates based more on character than ideology.
## Conclusion
While working for Trump was a difficult personal setback for my father and his company, in the end it served an unintended greater good. His experience provided a small counterweight to the unchecked propaganda of Trump's handbook and paved the way for him to see beyond political dogma. It opened his eyes to evaluate leadership and policy matters with a renewed skepticism and emphasis on ethics that has stayed with him since.
