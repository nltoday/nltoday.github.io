Two high-ranking IDF officers, Colonel Eli Cohen and Colonel David Golan, decided to get some fresh air and nature during their day off. However, their relaxing trip in nature took an unexpected turn.
### Lost and Found
Eli and David enjoyed their hike in the forests surrounding their IDF base. After two hours of walking trails and taking in the scenic views, they began making their way back to the base. As they approached the gates, Eli suddenly realized something was missing. "I can't believe it, I lost my gun!" he exclaimed to David. David checked his holster and sighed, "Shit! Me too!"

### A Plan in Motion  
The colonels knew they were in big trouble. Losing a service weapon was a serious offense that could end their careers. As they debated their next moves, David came up with an idea. "Since we are both **high-ranking IDF officers entitled to military courts**, let's judge one another. That way we avoid another officer finding out and punishing us both severely." Eli thought it over, "Great plan! At least this way one of us can go easy on the other." They hatched a scheme to switch roles as accuser and accused in a staged military tribunal.
### Trial of Colonel Eli Cohen
Back at the base, David suited up in his formal IDF uniform and entered the makeshift courtroom. Eli marched in and saluted his "judge". David began, "Colonel Eli Cohen, you stand accused of losing your service weapon on a recreational hike two hours past. How do you plead?" Eli responded somberly, "I admit to the charges, your honor." He recounted the events, assured it would not happen again, and pleaded for leniency. David deliberated briefly, "In light of your clean record and honest testimony, I hereby issue only a stern warning. Dismissed." Eli thanked David and left, Phase 1 complete. 
### Trial of Colonel David Golan  
Now it was David's turn in the defendant's chair. Eli sat as the imposing "judge" and read the charges against David, who admitted guilt just as planned. After David's plea, Eli said thoughtfully, "Normally a warning would suffice... [but losing weapons has become an alarming trend today](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-papillon-i-may-not-be-rich-and-famous-but-im-a-dog-mom-3). I'm afraid more than words are needed here to set an example. You are hereby sentenced to kitchen duty for one week." David accepted his punishment with grace, grateful the ordeal was over. Their secret remained safe, for now.
### A Surprise Inspection
The next day, Major Zahava Shalev was making her rounds through the base. As commanding officer, surprise inspections kept her soldiers on their toes. She entered the kitchen to review meal prep and stopped dead in her tracks. "Colonel Golan?! What are you doing here?" A deer-in-the-headlights look came over David. He stammered out an excuse involving punishment but Zahava wasn't convinced. Her suspicions grew by the hour as she began digging into the missing weapons report. 
### The Investigation Unfolds
Zahava pulled the incident logs and noticed anomalies in Eli and David's statements. Their stories didn't line up on key details like time of return and location of the supposed losses. She called them into her office for questioning. Under pressure, Eli broke first and came clean about their fake tribunal scheme. Zahava was furious at their blatant abuse of authority. Even worse, their plan had left a huge security gap that could be exploited by enemies. She had no choice but to bring their transgressions to the High Command for a **real military tribunal with serious consequences**.
### Before the Tribunal  
Eli and David anxiously awaited their fate as word spread of the unfolding scandal. The High Command took matters extremely seriously given the colonels' high security clearances and leadership roles. As the tribunal date approached, media buzz grew around potential punishments like dishonorable discharges, demotions, even jail time. The colonels knew this could end their careers in disgrace. Desperate, they wrote letters taking full responsibility in hopes of mercy. But they had truly broken the sacred trust of their positions and country. On judgment day, their fates would be in far less friendly hands than each others'. 
### Facing the Music
The courtroom fell silent as Eli and David entered in full dress uniform, likely for the last time. The panel of five star generals, judges, and advisors stared down from on high, unimpressed by past heroism or rank. Over four grueling hours, the flaws in the "tribunal" scheme and security dangers were laid bare. Eli and David had no more defenses, only contrite apologies. After private deliberation, the head judge stepped forward. He condemned their " arrogant abuse of power" that compromised service members everywhere. Then came the verdict: dishonorable discharge and six months confinement. Humbled, the former colonels quietly exited to begin their falls from grace.
### Aftermath and Legacy  
News of the IDF scandal rocked the nation, shaking confidence. Eli and David saw their long, decorated careers dismantled in an instant due to a foolish lapse in judgment. In prison, they reflected deeply on how far their pride had taken them from duty and truth. Upon release, civilian life was an adjustment with shadows from their past choices. However, over time both rebuilt purpose through service in smaller ways. Their case also left a mark, ensuring no one in the IDF could ever question or circumvent true process again without severe consequence. It served as a stern lesson for all on protecting obligations over ego, no matter one's status.
