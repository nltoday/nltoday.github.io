### Optimizing Game Performance
There are several things Simmers can do to optimize their game's performance and troubleshoot common errors. Properly managing custom content, mods, and save files is crucial.

### Keeping Your Save Files Lean
Like any open-world simulation game, The Sims 4 save files can gradually increase in size over time. Large or bloated save files are more prone to errors and bugs. It's recommended to back up saves regularly and start fresh neighborhoods occasionally. [Bulldozing unused lots](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/dog) and limiting excessive custom content and mods helps keep save files lean. Switching between households also clears excess processed data from memory.
### Utilizing Mods Wisely
While mods like Nraas Overwatch can fix bugs and improve stability, having too many or outdated mods could actually cause issues. Be sure to only use mods from reputable sources that are updated for your game version. Periodically remove mods you're not using to rule them out as potential problems. The **Overwatch error management mod** is highly recommended for its automated cleanup scripts.
### Troubleshooting Specific Error Codes 
Common error codes in The Sims 4 have diagnostic meanings and potential fixes. Error code 16 signals an overloaded save file exceeding 4GB limits. Try reducing lot counts, limiting textures, and starting a new neighborhood. Error code 12 relates to insufficient RAM to save. Close extra programs, switch households, or install Overwatch to free up memory.
### Fresh Installs for Persistent Issues
If problems persist despite troubleshooting, a fresh reinstall may be needed. Backup any saved data or custom content you want to keep. Start by moving your entire "The Sims 4" folder from Documents to safely store it offline. Launch the game to generate a new empty folder. Slowly add back Saves, then CC in batches to identify what may be causing issues. As a last resort, completely uninstall and reinstall the game in a clean configuration.
### Optimizing Computer Hardware 
For the best performance, utilize a computer that meets or exceeds The Sims 4's minimum requirements. Ensure you have at least 2GB of available RAM for the game alone, without other programs running. Graphics cards with 1GB or more video RAM allow better visual quality settings. SSD drives load saves faster than traditional HDDs. Regularly maintaining your computer through updates and minimizing background processes also helps optimize Sims 4's performance.
### Handling Specific Bugs Methodically
If encountering unexpected or strange bugs, take time to isolate the cause before assuming it's a game or system issue. Create a test save without CC or mods to see if the problem persists. If so, try repairing or reinstalling the game. Report technical bugs directly to EA/Maxis with detailed descriptions, your system specs, and reproduction steps so they can address the problem globally. Most problems stem from external factors that patient troubleshooting can identify and fix.
### When to Contact Customer Support
While many issues can be solved through community troubleshooting, some problems warrant official support. Contact EA Help if: a fresh reinstall doesn't resolve persistent issues, your game becomes corrupted or won't launch, or you experience critical bugs that can't be reproduced in test saves. Be prepared to provide thorough information about the behavior, your hardware, and all troubleshooting already attempted. The support team is better equipped to diagnose complex problems or submit bug reports to developers.
Overall, The Sims 4 remains one of the most stable and customizable life simulation games. With some preventative maintenance of saves, strategic mod usage, and methodical troubleshooting of errors, most problems can be resolved without disruptions to the Simming experience. Don't hesitate to leverage community support as well during trouble times.
