The path to success is never easy. It requires resilience, dedication, hard work and perseverance. What follows is my JEE journey - the ups and downs, challenges faced, lessons learned and ultimately achieving success. I hope it inspires and motivates others who are striving to achieve their goals. 
### Beginning preparations
I started preparing for JEE from class 11th at a reputed coaching institute in Ahmedabad. Initially classes were online due to the **COVID-19 pandemic**, which was a difficult adjustment. However, I worked hard to overcome the challenges and ensure **foundational concepts in Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics** were clear. Regular practice and tests helped improve **problem-solving ability and exam temperament**. Though the initial AIT exam results were below expectations, it served as a [wakeup call to go deeper into concepts](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-matching-funny-santa-riding-shetland-sheepdog-christmas-3-2) and practice tougher questions.

### Focusing on the core subjects
In class 12th, consistent performance saw me recommended for the star batch. With syllabus differences, I had to put in extra hours to **cover additional topics in parallel** while learning current ones. Staying true to my **rigorous timetable and practice routine** , I completed the Physics syllabus by August. For rest of the subjects, focus was on completing syllabus before start of full tests and exams. It was a **stressful period managing tests, final topic coverage and revisions** simultaneously. However, perseverance paid off as I started scoring in the medium range consistently.
### First JEE mains attempt 
The sudden announcement that mains 1st attempt will be in January 2022 instead of April added more pressure due to **school practicals and preboards** clashing. Yet, I dedicated maximum time to **Chemistry revision and practicing weaker topics** in the limited days. On exam day, I remained calm and focused despite initial nerves. Securing 99.9944732 percentile, just missing the perfect score due to a silly mistake, boosted my morale for advanced preparations. 
### Preparing for advanced intensely
After boards, I exclusively devoted myself to advanced prep for 45-50 days intensively. Regular **mock tests and detailed analysis** along with classroom learning helped improve. Targeting top 100 initially, consistent self-belief and hard work helped exceed even my own expectations on result day - securing AIR 49 with 301/360 marks. It was indeed a dream come true moment!
### Facing setbacks and disappointment 
What followed was not easy. Dropping out of motivation in class 12th, wasting an entire month without studies and falling into depression seeing preparation gaps were **major speed breakers**. However, taking a step back, objectively analysing weaknesses and following a targeted **revision-focused plan** helped get back on track. Attempting numerous full-length mocks under examination conditions and reviewing thoroughly was instrumental.  
### Closing in on the final target
All the effort finally paid off. Attempting around 20 full tests in the lead up to mains 2nd attempt, my average scores saw **consistent improvement crossing 180 marks**. Though boards preparation caused some distraction, practice under Allen helped. Scoring well inalmost all major tests boosted confidence. While results could have been better given silly mistakes, it was indeed a long and fruitful journey. 
### Looking back at learnings 
In retrospect, some key lessons were - consistency in practicing from the basics is vital, targeted revision and note making skills are most important. Seeking guidance from mentors and learning from peers also helped tremendously. Above all, perseverance, resilience and remaining focused on long term goals are biggest success mantras. Though IIT may not have been achieved, the invaluable life lessons from this experience will stay with me forever as I embark on the next chapter.
I hope sharing my JEE story provides motivation and inspiration to other aspirants to keep striving towards their dreams through ups and downs. Success lies in continuous effort and belief in oneself. Wishing everyone the very best in their preparatory journey!
