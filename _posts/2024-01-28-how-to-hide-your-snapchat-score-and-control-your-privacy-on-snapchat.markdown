Snapchat is a wildly popular social media platform that allows users to share photos, videos, and messages with friends on the platform. However, one aspect of Snapchat that many desire more privacy over is their Snapchat score - the number that indicates how many snaps a user has sent. 
While Snapchat does not currently offer a direct way to hide your snap score from friends, there are some effective methods users can employ to control who is able to view their score and enhance their privacy on the platform. This comprehensive guide will break down exactly how to hide your Snapchat score or make it private, as well as other privacy settings available to customize your experience.
### Controlling Snapchat Score Visibility 
The most direct way to control who can see your Snapchat score is by carefully managing your friends list. [Snapchat score visibility](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/agrawal) is tied to your friends - only other users who have added each other as friends on the platform are able to view each other's scores. If you want to hide your score from specific people, your best option is to remove or block them. This severs the score visibility between you.

### Adjusting Other Privacy Settings
While Snapchat does not have a dedicated "Make Score Private" setting, the platform does offer granular controls over other aspects of your privacy. You can adjust who is able to view your story, contact you, see your posted location, and find you in Quick Add. Carefully configuring these **privacy settings** allows you to selectively share different elements of your profile and activity with friends.
### Removing Friends Temporarily  
Rather than permanently blocking someone, you can opt to simply remove them as a friend for a period of time to hide your score. Once removed, they will not be able to see your score updates until added back. This is useful if you only want to temporarily block score visibility from selective peers. Just be sure to add them back once wanting your score visible again.
### Increasing Your Snap Score Fast
Some users looking to boost their seemingly "inactive" snap score have resorted to sneaky techniques like adding public figures or sending mass snaps to themselves. While this artificially inflates the number, it does not actually reflect real social engagement. A more honest approach is simply to actively use Snapchat as intended - by genuinely snapping and chatting with close friends and groups.
### Why Snapchat Scores Stop Increasing   
Don't panic if you notice a friend's snap score has ceased climbing. Most likely, they have become less active on the platform instead of trying to hide something. Remember scores only go up from active snapping. If they are chatting more than snapping lately, or spent time away from the app, it's normal for scores to plateau temporarily. Unless other odd behavior is spotted, no need to suspect foul play.
### Separating Online Personas
For some users like influencers or public figures, maintaining anonymity or multiple online personas is important. While Snapchat does not offer the ability to hide core identifying info like your snapped location or username, you can selectively control what parts of your activity different groups of followers see. Careful utilization of privacy toggles allows separation of personal vs professional audiences. 
### In Conclusion
While Snapchat continues improving, giving users more control over privacy aspects like a score hidden toggle would further empower members to customize their experience. In the meantime, leveraging available tools like selective friend removal, granular privacy settings adjustment and periodically vary online activity can still help achieve privacy goals on the popular platform. But focus above all on genuine engagement with close connections versus invisible metrics.
