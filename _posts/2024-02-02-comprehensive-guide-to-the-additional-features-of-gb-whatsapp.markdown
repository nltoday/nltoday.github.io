## Extensive Customization Options
GB WhatsApp provides users with extensive customization options not available on the default WhatsApp app. You can customize various aspects of the interface like **themes, fonts, colors,[ and ](https://yt.io.vn/collection/abdo)chat backgrounds.** This level of personalization allows you to create a unique look and feel for your chatting experience. In addition to pre-loaded themes, you can download additional high-quality **custom themes** and **emoji packs** from third-party sources to make your chats more lively and fun.  
### Enhanced Privacy Controls
The default privacy settings on GB WhatsApp are more robust. You get granular control over what parts of your profile others can see like your **online status, read receipts,** and **typing indicator.** This is useful if you want to selectively hide this information from certain contacts. You can also hide your general **WhatsApp status updates** to restrict visibility.

### Convenient Message Scheduling  
With the built-in **message scheduler,** you don't have to worry about forgetting to send important messages like **birthday greetings** or **event reminders** on time. Plan your messages in advance and schedule them to be delivered at the designated date and time in the future.
## Support for Dual Accounts and Extended Storage
### Run Two Accounts Simultaneously
GB WhatsApp lets you run **two WhatsApp accounts** simultaneously on a single device. This is perfect if you need to maintain separation between your **personal and professional** contacts. You no longer need to constantly log in and out or use multiple devices.
### Store More Media Content
The file sharing limits on GB WhatsApp are more generous. You can send videos up to **50MB** in size and audio clips up to **100MB** comfortably. You're also able to send a burst of **90 pictures** together. This is ideal if you want to quickly share high-resolution photos or elongated videos with your contacts. 
## Additional Helpful Tools
### Prevent Accidental Message Revocations  
GB WhatsApp claims to offer a way for messages not to be revoked or deleted after being sent. This protects the integrity and trustworthiness of important conversations by preventing accidental or intentional message tampering.
### Extend Status Update Visibility
You get more characters to work with for your WhatsApp status updates. Use the extra space to share longer, more informative **status updates** about yourself with your network.
### Accessibility Across Multiple Languages
The app supports over **100 languages** including popular ones like **Spanish, Chinese,** and **Arabic.** You don't need to change apps if you communicate with contacts worldwide.
## In Summary
In summary, GB WhatsApp unlocks many additional features that enhance convenience, privacy and customization compared to the official WhatsApp app. However, there are also inherent risks using an unauthorized third-party version. Carefully consider security, compatibility issues and the developer's ongoing support when deciding if GB WhatsApp is right for you.
