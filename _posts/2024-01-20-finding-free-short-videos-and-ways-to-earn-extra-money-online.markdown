## Finding Free Short Video Content
### Public Domain Platforms
Some older short films and shows may be available on public domain platforms where copyright has expired. However, these may not be the latest or highest production quality content. Platforms like Wikimedia Commons provide access to films and shows in the public domain.

### Non-Profit and Educational Platforms 
Certain non-profit or educational platforms may offer short videos for free without ads. Content on these platforms is often [educational videos](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-riding-moon-bike-halloween-lunar-cycling) or videos created to support specific causes. Examples include Khan Academy and OpenCulture which have short educational clips without advertisements. 
### Film Festivals and Competitions
Websites associated with film festivals and short film competitions sometimes provide free access to selected competition entries and winners. Keep an eye on well-known film festival sites like Sundance Film Festival for potential free releases of shorts.
### Creative Commons Licensed Content  
Platforms hosting content with **Creative Commons licenses** may provide ad-free shows. Sites like ccMixter and Wikimedia Commons have works licensed for public use and redistribution. Always check the specific Creative Commons license terms for each work.
## Watching Ads for Reward Sites like Swagbucks
One way to earn extra money online is by watching short video ads on reward websites like Swagbucks. These sites pay you in the form of points or cash rewards for completing tasks such as watching ads, taking surveys and shopping online.
### How Swagbucks Works
Swagbucks is a popular rewards site that allows users to earn Swagbucks credits (SB) for watching videos and other activities. You can earn up to 100 SB per day just from watching ads. Swagbucks frequently runs special offers and bonuses that can increase your daily earnings. 
Rewards are issued via PayPal or gift cards to popular retailers. It may take some time to accumulate enough SB for a higher reward, but Swagbucks is a legitimate site that pays users promptly. Always read the full terms of use on any reward site before spending significant time earning points.
### Other Sites Like Swagbucks
InboxDollars is another good option for watching short ads and earning rewards. While it caps daily video views at 30 compared to Swagbucks' 100, InboxDollars often runs video bonus promotions. Signing up to multiple reward sites gives more opportunities to maximize daily earnings through short ads.  
Both Swagbucks and InboxDollars require dedication to watch all available daily ads, but doing so passively while engaging in other tasks allows you to earn extra income for very little active effort. Just be sure not to expect large payouts from ad-viewing alone.
## Additional Platforms to Consider
### Library Streaming Services  
Many public and academic libraries now offer streaming services with video content. Sites like Kanopy and Hoopla Digital have short films, documentaries and TV episodes available to stream for free with a library card. Selection varies by library so check your local options.
### Educational Video Platforms
Websites oriented towards education typically have a range of short videos suitable for research or learning. Examples are Khan Academy, Crash Course and Ted-Ed, with short video lessons on various topics. Quality educational content is often provided free of charge or with limited ads.  
### Video Sharing Websites 
While sites like YouTube show ads, it also has a vast selection of short creative videos uploaded by users. Setting your account preferences to only search public domain or Creative Commons-licensed videos can surface many ad-free options. But video availability on any platform could change over time.
In summary, searching across all the platforms discussed here should uncover free short video content without ads. Be sure to thoroughly research each site's terms and any copyright or licensing restrictions on content. Checking a variety of sources also future-proofs your options as online video availability will likely continue evolving rapidly.
## Conclusion 
The online video landscape presents many opportunities to both access short free content and earn extra money through reward sites. Always research the legitimacy and track record of any money-earning platforms considered. While returns from ad-viewing won't substantially increase income, it provides a very passive way to accumulate small periodic rewards.  
For those seeking primarily free entertainment or educational content without advertisements, exploring options like public libraries, Creative Commons works and educational platforms should uncover suitable short video selections. Staying aware of new developments across all these spaces ensures ongoing access to viewing and earning options into the future. With a bit of effort, the online world can be leveraged both to further learning and to supplement income through short videos.
