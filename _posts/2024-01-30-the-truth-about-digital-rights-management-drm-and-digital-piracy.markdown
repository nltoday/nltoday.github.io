### A Losing Battle
DRM is a constant losing battle against piracy. Any DRM implemented is [always circumvented](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-king-chihuahua-wearing-crownqueen-chihuahua-dog-302-chihuahua-dog) within days. Game developers and publishers promote the false narrative that their games are protected to an extreme degree through various DRM implementations. However, it is merely a PR strategy to trick investors rather than a realistic defence against piracy. The cold hard fact remains that **anti-piracy efforts are futile**.

### Annoying Customers and Wasting Resources
DRM is a complete **waste of development time and money**. Not only does it fail to curb piracy, it results in legitimate customers facing **excessive annoyance and inconvenience**. Imagine if retail stores designed anti-shoplifting measures as intrusive as the average DRM system. It would drive away honest paying customers while doing little to nothing against shoplifters. All the resources poured into DRM could have been better spent on areas like marketing and game development itself to provide superior customer experience and value.
### The Golden Age of Digital Piracy 
For digital pirates, we are truly living in a golden age. With gigabit internet connections becoming mainstream, pirating games and other digital content is trivial. Even the most aggressive DRM implementations pose little obstacle. Pirates face practically zero risk while enjoying the spoils of others' work for free. For developers, it is an unfortunate reality that **piracy cannot be stopped through restrictions or bans alone**. 
### Understanding Your True Customers
Developers must accept that pirates are not their customers and will never pay regardless of any measures taken. The design and business model of a product should not be compromised to please those who never intended to pay in the first place. Rather, priority must be given to **treating honest customers with respect** by avoiding invasive DRM that negatively impacts the experience of those providing financial support.
### Spending Wisely to Achieve Growth
With piracy an unstoppable force, developers are better off focusing energies elsewhere. All the money spent developing and maintaining DRM systems would be far more productive if redirected to areas like **extensive marketing campaigns** and ongoing game support with new content updates. This stimulates legitimate sales and builds a large, dedicated player base with a vested interest who are then promoters for future titles. 
### Digital Ownership in the Streaming Era 
As gaming transitions to a streaming and subscription based model, the concept of digital ownership becomes ambiguous. While services offer extensive libraries for a low monthly fee, what happens down the line if that service disappears? For customers who have invested sizable funds purchasing games over the years, the prospect of losing access is understandably worrying. As such, it is only right that customers backing up their own **legally purchased libraries through piracy** cannot be condemned, especially given shady industry practices of removing titles from services without notice.
### Accepting Reality and Thriving Despite It
Ultimately, the reality is piracy cannot be defeated, only accepted. Rather than wasting efforts on a hopeless cause, developers are better served focusing on superior products that are worth the asking price on their own merit. By treating customers with respect while maintaining quality, popularity and revenue streams can be sustained even in a world of easy piracy access. Those accepting this tough truth will thrive, while those living in denial will continue burning resources in a futile battle against the inevitable.
### The Lure of Steam Sales Addiction 
For legitimate customers, the gaming platform of choice has long been Steam. And its seasonal mega sales are a true danger to budgets. Once hooked, it becomes seemingly impossible to resist impulse buying titles at steep discounts that may never even be played. Before long, libraries swell to massive proportions. While this is lucrative for Valve in the short term, it also risks customer fatigue if taken too far. Moderation is key to avoid potential backlash in future.
### A Backlog of Unplayed Games    
With constant deals too good to pass up, the backlog of untouched Steam games continues growing out of control for many. Titles get purchased on a whim with no real intention of imminent play, driven solely by the irresistible low price. While completists may find joy in slowly chipping away, this hoarding behavior does neither the customer nor developer any favors. Perhaps limiting future purchases until the existing library receives substantial attention could be a wise move to avoid wasted spending and bring the focus back to engaging gameplay over mindless accumulation. 
### Accepting a Gigabit Future of Piracy
For customers who have invested considerable funds amassing digital libraries, taking local backups through piracy must be accepted as a reasonable response if services disappear overnight as they are prone to do. No draconian EULA or terms of service can reasonably expect compliance when consumers are left high and dry with nothing to show after supporting developers for years. In the high-speed gigabit age, attempting to ban or curb piracy is an utterly lost cause. A more pragmatic approach is for services and developers to avoid antagonizing paying users through unreasonable restrictions or sudden access revokes that drive legitimate customers towards piracy out of justifiable frustration and a desire to preserve their investments.
### Moving Forward with Understanding 
Recognizing the futility of the piracy battle while respectfully serving genuine paying customers is the wise path for all involved moving forward. Developers should focus on creating great works worth supporting through fair business practices rather than wasting time on punitive DRM. Meanwhile, customers too can exercise greater restraint in their purchasing habits for a healthier relationship with gaming. With understanding from all sides, thriving can continue despite piracy being an inescapable reality of the digital domain.
