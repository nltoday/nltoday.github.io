### Resetting Windows Update Components
If the troubleshooter does not resolve the error, you may need to manually reset the Windows update services and components. Open an administrative Command Prompt and enter the following commands one by one to stop and rename specific update folders:
```
net stop wuauserv
net stop cryptSvc
net stop bits
net stop msiserver
ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 catroot2.old
```
Once complete, restart the services:
```
net start wuauserv
net start cryptSvc
net start bits
net start msiserver
```
This [resets Windows update folders](https://store.fi.io.vn/woman-cant-resist-her-shiba-inu-dog-lover-1) and components to their original state. Try installing updates again after restarting your PC.
### Scanning for System File Issues
System file corruption is a common cause of error 0x80070490. The System File Checker (SFC) scans for and fixes issues with important Windows files. Open an administrative Command Prompt and run:
```
sfc /scannow
```
Be patient - this **scans all system files** for integrity and may take some time to complete. It will repair any files found to be damaged without needing to reinstall Windows.
### Checking for Hard Drive Errors
Hard drive problems can also interfere with Windows updates. Use the CHKDSK tool to scan for and fix disk errors:
```
chkdsk /f
```
Restart your PC after running this command to initiate the **disk checking and repair process**.
### Utilizing the Windows Repair Tool
Microsoft provides a dedicated Windows Update Repair Tool that can automatically detect and mend update-related problems. Download the tool, run it, and let it thoroughly check your system. This is an easy way to leverage a **Microsoft-supported troubleshooting application**.
### Dismantling Corrupted System Files
As a last resort, use the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool to verify and restore the health of all core Windows files. Open an administrative Command Prompt and enter:
```
DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
```
Be very patient, as DISM may take over an hour to complete its thorough scanning and repairing of any damaged files. Once done, restart and attempt updates again - DISM aims to ensure all files are **100% intact and problem-free**.
### Considering a Clean Reinstall
If the error persists after exhausting all troubleshooting options, you may need to perform a clean reinstall of Windows. This ensures your OS installation and files are in pristine condition from the start. Back up your personal files first to avoid data loss.
While reinstalling is a big task, it can resolve underlying issues better than any troubleshooting methods. Just be prepared to reconfigure Windows and reinstall all applications and drivers from scratch afterwards. For serious system problems, a clean wipe and fresh start may be necessary.
### Seeking Further Assistance
If the error code 0x80070490 remains even after a clean Windows reinstall, you likely have a hardware problem requiring professional diagnosis and repair. Contact Microsoft support for guidance troubleshooting driver and firmware issues. An IT professional may also need to inspect your computer if all software solutions have failed. Don't lose hope - with patience and the right help, your update problems can be fixed!
In summary, carefully working through resets, scans, repairs and reinstalls is often needed to resolve this frustrating Windows error. Have persistence and try each method thoroughly before moving on. With some trial and error, you should eventually get your system in a stable state where updates install smoothly again.
