### Downloading Games on PC
When you purchase a Steam game from the mobile app, it automatically unlocks that game on your linked Steam account. This means you now have access to download and play that game on any device linked to your account, including your PC. To start downloading, simply open the Steam desktop client and login with the same credentials. 
Navigate to your game library either from the main navigation menu or by clicking "Library" at the top. Here you will see all games you own, including the recently purchased mobile title. Click on the game tile and then select the "Install" button to begin downloading the game files to your computer. [Steam downloads](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-tote-bag-chihuahua-shopping-bag-chihuahua-chihuahua-gift5365-t-shirt) can vary in size depending on the game but expect it to take some time over your home internet connection. Once complete, the game is ready to launch and play directly from your library.

### Activating Steam Keys 
An alternative to direct purchasing on Steam is buying keys from authorized retailers. These are delivered as a 25-character product code that needs activating in your Steam account before downloading. To do this, look for the "Games" menu item and select "Activate a Product on Steam...". A new window will open prompting for the code. Enter it carefully and click "Next", then your game will be added to your account. The process from here is the same as above - find the game in your library and install. Be wary of illegitimate key sellers as there is a risk of codes being revoked. Only buy from trusted brands.
### Streaming from Mobile 
For lighter games that your PC may struggle with, Steam introduced remote play functionality a few years ago. This allows streaming select titles directly from your mobile device over WiFi. After installing the Steam Link app on Android/iOS, open it and sign in. Your PC's game library will appear for remote access. Pick the game, adjust screen resolution if needed, then use on-screen controls or pair a compatible controller. Latency can vary by your network but it's a handy option for casual play anywhere in your home.
### Improving Download Speeds
The speed of downloading games depends on your internet plan of course but there are some tricks to potentially boost throughput. First, check that you have the latest network card drivers installed as outdated versions can negatively impact performance. Also quit any other bandwidth-hogging apps like torrent clients or video streaming services. Within Steam settings under "Downloads", try limiting the maximum connections or changing server location - a nearer regional server may be faster. As a last resort, pausing other downloads temporarily gives your connection full capacity for that one game.
### Offline Game Access  
While an internet connection is required for the initial install, many Steam games can still be played offline once installed. Right-click the game in your library, select Properties, then check the box for "Enable Offline Mode". This allows launching without being online. Handy if you want to game while away from home or during an outage. Some multiplayer or games-as-a-service titles will not work offline but most single-player experiences should. Just be aware Steam will want to go back online periodically to sync saves/progress with the cloud.
### Choosing Install Location
By default, all Steam games get installed to your main drive's Program Files folder. However, you have flexibility to change this if needed. Go to Steam settings, Downloads, and the Steam Library Folders option. Here you can add new library paths on additional drives/partitions. When installing a new game, a drop-down will let you pick the drive to use. This is useful for SSD/HDD setups where you want frequently played games on the speedier SSD for quicker load times but save storage space by moving older titles elsewhere. Just remember to keep library folders backed up.  
### Transferring Games between PCs  
Rather than re-downloading an entire game on a new PC, it's possible to transfer the existing installed files over. First, backup the Game folder found within your Steam library location. Then logout of Steam on the original machine. On the new PC, log into Steam, navigate to the installation location dropdown and select to add a new Steam library folder. Point this to the backup folder from the first PC. Steam will scan and detect the already installed game, just hit "Install" and it will be ready to launch without further download. Saves may need to be moved separately.
### Optimizing Your Gaming Experience
Taking the time to properly install and configure Steam on your PC ensures the smoothest experience buying and playing games. Use good network practices, choose appropriate library locations, and consider offline access and backup plans. With a bit of setup, you can be up and gaming in no time after purchases on mobile or wherever Steam may take you. Always enjoy gaming responsibly and be sure to keep hardware, software and accounts secured against potential risks online and off.
