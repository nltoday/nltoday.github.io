### Choosing the Right Location
The location of your farm depends on whether you are playing on a multiplayer server or single player world. 
On a server, you may not have access to the seed or creative mode abilities depending on the rules. [Trial and error](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cow-funny-animal-cute-rainbow-graphic-for-men-women-and-kids-v-neck-t-shirt/men&) is often the best approach to finding slime chunks by exploring underground areas below Y=40 where slimes spawn naturally. Another reliable option is checking swamp biomes which commonly spawn slimes but yields are lower than a dedicated farm. 
If mods are allowed, client-side minimap mods and online chunk mappers can help locate slime chunks. **Xaero's Minimap** is a popular choice with built-in slime chunk finding. Otherwise, you'll need to hollow out spaces in every chunk and monitor for spawns.
For single player worlds, it's much easier. Using the **slime chunk finder** tool with your world seed shows the precise chunks where slimes will spawn. Mark them on a map for an automated farm location.

### Designing the Farm Structure
When building a slime farm, the ideal setup uses a group of 4 adjacent chunks in a plus shape with a central chunk left open below Y=40. This **maximizes spawn rates** across the four outer chunks which are all within the spawning range of each other and the central area. 
Leave the center space free for other uses like item sorting systems and storage. Place a few half slab floors within the spawning chunks to restrict slime movement while keeping the spawnable space open. Add water streams or minecart elevators to efficiently transport the slimeballs to collection areas.
### Automating Slime Collection
With the 1.13 update, **water streams** provide an easy way to transfer slimes and slimeballs upwards without needing rails or minecarts. Place source blocks every few blocks leading to a 1-block gap, allowing items to flow up gradually. At the top, sort items and xp into storage with hopper lines.
Another method uses minecarts and **hopper minecarts** running on rails in the center area. With detector rails connected to pulse generators, the carts can pick up drops and transfer them downwards layer by layer. Store everything at bedrock using an underground chest container accessible by hoppers.
### Enhancing Spawn Rates  
For extra efficiency, light up all caves within a 128-block radius to discourage mobs from spawning elsewhere. Also isolate the farm area with walls at least 24 blocks out from the edges to prevent other surface spawns from interfering.
During a full moon phase, slime spawn chances doubles naturally in swamp biomes. For bursts of rapid collection, visit the swamp at night but it's not suitable as an AFK farm. **Restoking supplies overnight** is more practical using an automated slime chunk farm.
### Maximizing Long-Term Yields
Well-built slime farms can produce great quantities of slimeballs for crafting purposes without much manual effort. Periodic improvements like expanding the spawnable area or upgrading collection systems keep yields high long-term. With the right multi-chunk design and automation, **afk slime farming provides a renewable slime supply.**
