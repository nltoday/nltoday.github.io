Mailing something involves more factors than simply putting it in an envelope and dropping it in a mailbox. This guide covers the key things to know about the mail delivery process to help ensure your mail reaches its destination.
### Address Accuracy is Key
Getting the address correct is important for mail delivery. Using the full Zip code increases the chances of successful delivery. The closer the address matches the intended recipient, the better. Minor errors may still allow delivery, but significant mistakes could result in returns. Always double check addresses before mailing.
Mailing addresses have very specific formats to help sorting machines and carriers efficiently route mail. [Zip code](https://store.fi.io.vn/ugly-christmas-sweater-funny-french-bulldog-dog-unicorn) plus four digits provide the most accurate location information. Five-digit Zips give a general area but not a precise delivery point. Ensure the name, street, city, state and full nine-digit Zip are included and spelled correctly. Typos can divert mail to the wrong place.

### Deposit Location Matters for Some Items  
Where you deposit your mail for some items, like packages, can impact costs. Postage rates are often based on the distance traveled. Calculating postage from one post office but depositing at another further away could result in additional fees. Mailing labels have an option to specify the "Mailed From" location to account for this. Always check rates for distance-based products using your actual mailing location.
### International Mail Needs More Details
Sending mail internationally adds layers of complexity. Clarifying your country of residence and how the item was sent is key to determining delivery odds. Some places lack a postal system, while others only deliver within their own infrastructure. Knowing the destination country guides applicable rules and regulations. International shipments typically require extra customs forms, **tracking numbers** for visibility, and sufficient postage for transit between postal administrations.
### Packaging is Vital for Protection
Proper packaging preserves mail integrity which means a higher chance of intact delivery. Fragile items need padding, cushioning and enclosure in a box designed for content type and size. Don't overstuff envelopes as they may burst open in transit. Clearly write "FRAGILE" on packaging containing breakables. Avoid liquids, perishables or hazardous materials which are restricted in postal transportation. Your goal is for the recipient to receive mail in the same condition as when sent.
### Delivery Timelines Depend on Service
Standard mail takes a few days but priority is faster. Choosing the appropriate class affects transit time and costs. Understand service level commitments for when delivery is expected versus guaranteed. Certain services have delivery timeframe goals but no penalties for occasional lateness due to volume fluctuations or weather events. Opt for tracking when a delivery timestamp matters. Otherwise basic untracked mail relies on best effort routing through postal networks.
### Common Issues and Exceptions Explained
Occasionally things go wrong - mail is lost, damaged or delayed. Customer service can help troubleshoot if issues arise. Mistakes happen as mail moves through automated facilities and human hands. Inclement weather, natural disasters or staffing problems impact operations. The Postal Service works to get mail there in a reasonable timeframe barring any difficulties. Understanding potential roadblocks prevents unrealistic expectations. Their goal is reliable delivery within service commitments whenever feasible.
### Contact Support for Resolution
If mail does not arrive as planned, first check for address errors or delays due to special circumstances before assuming loss. Contact the sending Postal Service with tracking details to research status. Lost international items may require working with both origin and destination postal administrations. Stating the full contents aids recovery efforts. Inquire about indemnity claims if replacements are owed due to damage or destruction to regulated mail. With patience and cooperation, representatives strive to resolve every reported problem.
