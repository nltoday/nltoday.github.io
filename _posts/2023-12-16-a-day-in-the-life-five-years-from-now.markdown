### Reflecting on the Future
It was a sunny Saturday afternoon and I found myself daydreaming about what my life might look like in five years time. At twenty years old, I would have just graduated from college with a double major in [writing and psychology](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-matching-holiday-outfits-shiba-inu-dog-christmas-tree-2). Throughout high school, I had always loved exploring both creative writing and learning about human behavior and development. Now, I hoped to put those interests to use helping others.

### Plans for College and Beyond  
As I reflected on possible career paths, becoming a **pediatric psychotherapist** really appealed to me. I wanted to provide counseling and support to children and teenagers struggling with mental health issues, academic pressure, social challenges, and more. Even if I could make a positive impact in the lives of just a few young people, it would be deeply fulfilling. However, I realized I still had some personal growth ahead of me before deciding on a specific career path or college. For now, those decisions could wait.
### Hopes for Relationships
One relationship I hoped would still be going strong five years in the future was with my high school boyfriend. We had a **long-distance relationship** now while attending different colleges, which certainly posed challenges. But I chose to remain optimistic that our connection could withstand the trials of physical separation and busy schedules. More than anything, I wanted us to still be together, holding hands as we faced the adventures and uncertainties of early adulthood side by side. 
### Connections with Dear Friends
Another key part of my vision for the future involved the invaluable people I had met through online communities and social networks. I cherished the deep bonds I had formed with many talented and kind-hearted individuals from all over the world. While we may not be physically side by side, I knew our emotional support for one another would endure for years to come. Five years from now, I hoped all of my **"frenzies"** remained close friends offering encouragement and joy in my life's journey.
### A Day on the Farm Five Years Later
Shifting my mindset forward five more years, I imagined what a typical day might look like for me living in a small village. By then, I expected to be married and settling into life on our family's farm. In my daydream, I saw myself waking before dawn to begin daily chores with my wife by my side. We would tend to the buffaloes, check on crops, and spend meaningful moments together between tasks. Family and hard work uniquely intertwined in the peaceful rural lifestyle I envisioned for my future.
### Treasured Time with Loved Ones 
Once work was done for the day, relaxing time would be cherished. I pictured sharing evening meals surrounded by loved ones, chatting with the family, and retiring to quiet moments with my wife before sleep. Overall, the pace of life seemed slow and simple - a welcome contrast from our fast-moving modern world. Rooted in nature and nurturing relationships, this vision brought me great comfort and hope. While uncertain what specific paths my life may take, dedicating it to cherished people and purpose gave me confidence all would be well.
### Gratitude for Each New Day
As my daydreams came to an end, I smiled thinking how far I've come and how much farther I still wished to travel. Five years is such a short period, yet holds endless potential for growth, experiences, and chapters still unwritten. I felt profoundly grateful for each new day to take another step toward realizing my hopes and helping others along the way. My future remained unshaped clay, and I looked forward to spending the upcoming years discovering who I am meant to become.
