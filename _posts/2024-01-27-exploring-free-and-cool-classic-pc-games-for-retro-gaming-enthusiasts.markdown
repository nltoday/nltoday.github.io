### **Classic First-Person Shooters that Stood the Test of Time**
Some of the most iconic and beloved PC games of all time come from the genres of first-person shooters and multiplayer online battle arenas. While many modern titles require a significant investment both financially and time-wise, there are still amazing classic FPS games that continue to thrive thanks to dedicated communities. 
One such free and open source title is [Xonotic](https://store.fi.io.vn/poodle-lover-dog-mom-520-poodles-1), a game inspired by the glory days of **Quake** and **Unreal Tournament**. With fast-paced arena combat focused on pure mechanics over excessive realism, Xonotic captures the essence of what made those 90s shooters so enjoyable and replayable. Its availability across Windows, Linux, and Mac also increases its accessibility. While the visuals may not compare to triple-A productions, Xonotic more than makes up for it with stellar level design and balanced, competitive multiplayer.

### **Free to Play Halo Experience on PC** 
Speaking of beloved shooter franchises, many PC gamers were disappointed that **Halo** never received proper PC ports beyond the original games. Thankfully, fans stepped in to fill that void. Eldewrito brought a fully-playable version of **Halo Online** to Windows, replicating the classic Halo gameplay that Xbox owners enjoyed for years. With 20+ player servers and classic maps, modes, and equipment staying true to Bungie-era Halos, Eldewrito was a godsend for those craving the epic sci-fi arena battles on their preferred platform. 
Sadly it's no longer in development due to a DMCA takedown, but similar projects like **Installation 01** seek to carry the torch. While still in development, Installation 01 shows great promise to deliver a polished stand-alone Halo experience for PC when complete. Projects like these allow the legacy of the original Halo trilogy to live on outside of Xbox consoles.
### **Blizzard Classics for Free**
As one of the pillars of PC gaming, Blizzard Entertainment has gifted us with many beloved franchises over the decades. Though their latest games come with premium price tags, they have generously made early entries in two of their biggest series completely free to play. The massively multiplayer real-time strategy classic **StarCraft** including its epic campaign and competitive multiplayer is now freely downloadable on Blizzard's website. 
Alongside it is **Heroes of the Storm (HOTS)**, Blizzard's multiplayer online battle arena take on their various universes smashed together in fierce team fights. As a " **hero brawler**" focused on objective control rather than laning or farming gold, HOTS streamlined the MOBA formula into rapid-paced action that welcomed both MOBA experts and newcomers. Both StarCraft and HOTS still have dedicated fans playing them daily over 20 years later, proving their timeless designs.
### **Oldschool Arena Shooters to Savor**
While tactical shooters took over the popularity of the genre in the 2000s, there remains a dedicated group that appreciates the pure adrenaline rush of arena deathmatch. Classics like **Quake III Arena**, **Unreal Tournament 2004,** and to a lesser known extent, **Counter-Strike 1.6** still have active communities keeping their balanced, movement-oriented multiplayer thriving through dedicated servers. 
While not free, these games can usually be found for just a few dollars during Steam sales. Playing them against skilled opponents highlights how far ahead of their time their innovations were, from air control to weapon balance. No frills, just pure fun competitive shooting in iconic sci-fi playgrounds. For fans looking to relive the glory days or experience what defined the arena shooter golden age, these remain the pinnacles even two decades later.
### **Alternate Takes on Arena Combat** 
Though tactical shooters may dominate the modern scene, a few daring indies have tried to recapture elements of what made arena deathmatch so compelling in its prime. **Xonotic** showed it was possible through open source means, but other commercial efforts have tried as well with varied levels of success. 
One such game is **Diabotical**, which aimed to synthesize Quake and Unreal Tournament for esports while also being approachable for casual players. With vibrant visuals, emphasis on movement tech, and creative new modes like "Bombing Run", Diabotical nailed the arena shooting fundamentals despite some rough edges at launch. With ongoing development, it could realize its potential as a competitive arena renaissance. 
Another leftfield entry is **Toxikk**, a boomer shooter that may lack polish but understands arena combat down to its core. maps feel designed for perfect player flow rather than realism, and weapons all have roles without being over- or underpowered. Toxikk may lack features, but what it focuses on it nails with passion. These indie games show there's still room for reinvention within the genre's tight formula.
# Conclusion 
The PC platform continues to see new entries pushing genre boundaries, yet its roots remain strong in the arena shooters and RTS games that helped define it. Thanks to passionate communities and dedicated fan projects, classic titles from FPS legends like id Software, Epic, and Bungie as well as strategy titans like Blizzard can still be experienced decades later across Windows, Linux, and Mac. Whether reliving nostalgia or discovering gems of gaming history, there are plenty of amazing free and low-cost options for retro gaming aficionados seeking their next PC gaming fix.
