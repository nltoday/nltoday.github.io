### Can You Still Play Downloaded Games After Game Pass Runs Out? 
Many Game Pass subscribers wonder what will happen to the games they've downloaded through the subscription service once their membership expires. The good news is, any games you've already installed on your console can still be played even after Game Pass runs out. [While your digital license to access the Game Pass library is revoked when the subscription ends](https://store.fi.io.vn/cute-axolotl-funny-i-axolotl-questions-salamander-265/women&), you retain full access to any titles you previously downloaded using the service.

### No More Downloads or Online Features Without an Active Subscription
One important thing to note is that once Game Pass expires, you will no longer be able to download any new games from the catalog. **The Game Pass library digital rights management** prevents installing additional titles without a valid subscription linked to your Xbox Live account. Any games you try to download will result in an error message. Multiplayer and online features are also blocked for previously downloaded Game Pass games without an active membership. 
### An Expired Subscription Prompts Purchase Options at Launch 
When you launch a game you downloaded through Game Pass after the subscription ends, your Xbox will recognize you no longer have the license to play. You'll be prompted with a message asking if you'd like to purchase the full digital version from the online store or resume your Game Pass membership. **This provides a convenient way to continue playing a favorite Game Pass title you've invested hours in by making a one-timepurchase rather than having to uninstall and redownload later.**
### How Long Can You Keep Playing Downloaded Games Without Resubscribing? 
There is no set expiration date for accessing your previously downloaded Game Pass library after the subscription lapses. **As long as the game files remain on your console's hard drive, you can keep launching and playing those specific titles indefinitely without any additional fees.** Microsoft does not actively remove your access or force you to resubscribe within a certain timeframe. The downloaded games will remain fully playable for as long as you want without the need to repurchase until intentionally deleted.
### What Happens if You Delete a Game You Downloaded With Game Pass?  
If at any point after your Game Pass subscription ends you choose to manually uninstall or delete a game you previouslydownloaded through the service, you will no longer have access to play it. **Without a current digital license tied to your account, deleting the game files essentially removes your right to launch that title going forward.** Should you later decide you want to play it again, you would then need to either reactivate your Game Pass membership to redownload, or purchase the full standalone version from the digital store.
### In Summary - Key Things to Know About Using Downloaded Games Post-Subscription 
The key things to understand about retaining access to your downloaded Game Pass library after the subscription runs out include: you can keep launching and playing already installed titles indefinitely without any time restrictions; no new game installations or multiplayer access permitted; launching a downloaded game prompts a promotional message to purchase or resubscribe; and uninstalling/deleting a game removes your right to play it going forward without repurchasing the license. **This allows subscribers flexibility to keep playing invested games while considering options to continue the library access long-term.**
