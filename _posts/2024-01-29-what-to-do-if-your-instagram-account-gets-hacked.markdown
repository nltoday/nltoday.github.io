Instagram is one of the most popular social media platforms today, with over 1 billion monthly active users. Unfortunately, some malicious actors take advantage and hack into unsuspecting users' accounts. If you find that your Instagram account has been compromised, here are the steps to regain access and secure it going forward.
### Identify If Your Account Has Been Hacked 
Some signs that your Instagram account may have been hacked include: being logged out and unable to log back in with your correct username and password, receiving notifications for actions you did not take such as liking or commenting on posts, notices that your profile name or bio has been changed without your permission. It's important to act quickly if you notice any irregular or unauthorized activity to minimize potential damage.

### Change Your Password Immediately 
The first step is to change your Instagram password without delay. Hackers may have gained access to your account using your existing password, so updating it prevents them from logging back in. Choose a new strong password that combines letters, numbers, and symbols to make it difficult to guess. Do not reuse passwords across multiple accounts for extra security. 
### Review Your Login Activity and Recent Posts
Check your Instagram account's login history and recently posted content to see what changes the hacker may have made. Look for logins from unfamiliar locations or devices. Delete any posts, videos, stories, or comments you did not create yourself. This removes any misleading or inappropriate content the hacker shared from your account.
### Request Password Reset if Unable to Log In 
If changing your password was unsuccessful in logging back into your account, you may need to request a password reset directly from Instagram. From the login screen, select the "Forgot Password?" option and enter your username, email, or phone number associated with the account. Instagram will send a login link to confirm ownership and allow you to create a new password.
### Enable Two-Factor Authentication
To prevent future hacking attempts, set up **two-factor authentication** (2FA) for your Instagram account. This adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password by requiring a one-time code from an authentication app each time you log in from a new device or browser. Integrate 2FA using the Instagram app or your profile settings for enhanced protection of your account going forward.
### Contact Instagram Support for Assistance 
If you are still locked out even after resetting your password multiple times, contact Instagram directly through their support channels. Provide details of your account username, when you noticed the unauthorized access, and any steps already taken. Their team may be able to restore your account ownership, investigate any suspicious activity, and offer additional tips. Response times can vary, so be patient.   
### Consider Using a Specialized Hacking Recovery Service
For severe hacking situations where you've been completely locked out for an extended time despite contacting Instagram, a specialized account recovery service may be helpful. Experts at such services have experience dealing with sophisticated hackers and employ techniques like social engineering to convince them to willingly relinquish control of the compromised account back to the rightful owner. Just be sure to carefully vet any service before sharing personal details or paying any fees.
### Improve Your Online Security and Privacy Practices
Once your Instagram account is secured, take some time to review your overall online security and privacy practices. Look for weaknesses in devices, passwords, applications, or habits the hacker may have exploited. Regularly updating devices, using a password manager with unique complex passwords for each site, and limiting what data you share publicly can help prevent similar incidents going forward. With some preventative steps and vigilance, you can better protect yourself and your valuable online accounts and digital assets.
I hope these tips help if your Instagram account falls victim to hacking. Regaining control takes effort but is possible with the right approach. Don't hesitate to act quickly upon noticing any unauthorized access or suspicious activity on your accounts. Strengthening security going forward also prevents future compromised accounts and headaches down the road. Stay safe online!
