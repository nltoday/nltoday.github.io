### Following the Star
The wise men, or [Magi](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-pug-mom-said-baby-funny-pug-dog-pet-lover-christmas-gifts-2), followed an astronomical sign that indicated the birth of a king. According to astrological beliefs at the time, certain celestial events held divine meanings. An extremely rare planetary configuration occurred in March of 5 BC containing patterns of the Star of David and Seal of Solomon. Only those versed in the heavens, like the Magi, would understand its significance.

### A Watchful Eye on the Lineage of David
The Magi were part of an important Parthian group called the Megistanes responsible for successor recommendations to the Parthian throne. They also tracked royal bloodlines, including the lineage of kings David and Solomon. Some within the ruling Parthian dynasty believed descent from these biblical figures. The Magi thus keenly observed anyone with such ancestry, explaining their interest in Jesus.
### An Entourage, Not Three Individuals 
Nowhere does the Bible specify three Magi. It only mentions gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. The text's wording implies a larger group. Their arrival with treasures worth millions troubled King Herod and all Jerusalem, unlikely for just three travelers. As noble advisors to the Parthian king, the Magi likely came with an entourage for traveling safely with such wealth. 
### Protecting the Rightful Heir  
Seeing Jesus' astrological sign and ancestry, the Magi recognized him as the "King of the Jews" and potential Parthian ruler. After their visit, they ensured Herod could not harm Jesus by returning home anonymously. The Magi may have watched over Jesus and his family afterwards to prevent Roman or Jewish threats, explaining why Romans left him alone during his ministry.
### Sending a Message to Parthia
When Jewish authorities charged Jesus and pressured Rome for execution, Roman participation served to acknowledge Jesus as the Magi-proclaimed "King of Jews" while blaming Judeans. This prevented war with Parthia, for whom the Magi spoke. Without the Magi's interest at his birth in Bethlehem, Jesus may not have survived infancy under Roman rule.
### Following the True Star 
The Magi's pilgrimage spiritually represents all peoples throughout time journeying guided by God's light to the heavenly Jerusalem, presenting themselves completely to Christ. While popular creations imagine just three Magi, scripture gives no numberâ€”only that many wise foreigners traveled great distances driven by divinely appointed signs to pay homage to the world's new King. Their example of faith continues inspiring seekers of truth today.
