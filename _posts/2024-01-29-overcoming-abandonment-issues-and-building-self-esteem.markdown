### Finding Your Inner Strength
Growing up without bonding with my birth mother or receiving nurture from the orphanage staff, I struggled with deep feelings of abandonment that plagued me for decades. Believing something was inherently wrong with me, I turned the blame inward whenever friends chose others over me or relationships ended. It wasn't until my 30s that I realized I had a problem. 
What helped was focusing on my strengths rather than flaws. I pursued new opportunities like earning my associate's degree and [volunteering in my local community](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/ader) to cultivate confidence and purpose apart from others' validation. Learning to be content alone through activities like hiking, cooking and prayer eased my codependent tendencies. With time and discipline, I learned to believe in myself.

### Learning From Compassionate Company
Meeting my understanding girlfriend changed everything. Where others grew impatient with my insecurity, she listened without judgment and reassured me with **calming words of acceptance and support**.

Accepting help took courage, yet relying on one to solve problems risked codependency. My girlfriend reminded me that inner strength exists beyond what others supply. As abandonment fears lessened, I recognized controlling behaviors like isolating when angry weren't serving me. 
Through self-study of psychology and emotions, I learned how thoughts drive reactions and looked inward rather than outward for answers. Meditation and journaling about needs versus wants separated valid concerns from baseless worries. Regular exercise and healthy eating balanced mind and body during stress. Slowly, an **ability to self-soothe through difficult moments** emerged where there had only been panic.
### Valuing Yourself Unconditionally  
True freedom came when I stopped measuring self-worth by others' judgments, presence or gifts. Comparing led nowhere good; what filled me had to come from within. As psychologist Carl Rogers said, "**the more I can accept myself as I am, the more change I am likely to effect**." 
Loving unconditionally meant extending that grace inward. When abandonment convinced me of defectiveness, self-acceptance proved its lie. I owed myself happiness whether alone or accompanied. Free from needing validation, relationships became choices instead of necessities, as enriching but not defining. By embracing imperfections and unique talents, I found the approval that mattered most.

Years tackling insecurity through education, therapy and willpower strengthened my foundation, yet fear lingered its ghost. Maintaining growth required diligence and preventing complacency. Daily affirmations, journaling about victories big and small plus mantras like "I am enough" reinforced renewed identity.

Reminding others that within lies solutions inspires taking the first step toward acceptance and autonomy regardless past hurts. Each life touched pass on tools for growth motivates continued efforts, as small acts of service cultivate appreciation for life's beauty in both solitude and community. Though scars remain, purpose strengthens where weakness once thrived.
### Believing in Your Infinite Potential  
Looking back, what was a lifelong struggle seems but growing pains on the path to self-actualization. Obstacles faced define character and teach compassion few know. While abandonment born from no fault of my own stained childhood, conquering its effects through resilience of spirit proves every person holds power over past.
Doubts will surface according their nature, yet staying vigilant against their manipulation safeguards freedom. Believing in infinite human potential means seeing beyond outward form to divinity within seeking light. There healing happens and strength takes root to uplift other travelers on life's journey. Though the road remains long, each step forward reflects glory of unstoppable human spirit destined to overcome all darkness it encounters.
