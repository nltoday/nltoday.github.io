### Check-in Requirements
When travelling by airplane within India, there are a few key documents you'll need for check-in. First and foremost, you'll need proof of your [air ticket booking or reservation](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-fauch-und-rottweiler-chaos-team-rottweiler-3-1). Many airlines allow you to check-in online and print your boarding pass ahead of time. Beyond the booking confirmation, you'll also need a valid **photo identification card like your Aadhar card or Pan card**. These IDs are sufficient for domestic flights within India.

### Arriving at the Airport
Plan to arrive at the airport **at least 2-3 hours** before your scheduled departure time. This gives you ample time to pass through security screening and make it to your departure gate before it closes. Only ticketed passengers are permitted in the airport terminal areas. Any friends or family members seeing you off will need to say goodbye outside the main entrance. Look for signs indicating where check-in counters for your specific airline are located.
### Checking Bags and Obtaining Boarding Passes
At the check-in counter, present your printed or mobile boarding pass along with your photo ID for verification by airline staff. You can check one piece of luggage which will be tagged and routed separately from your carry-on bag. Inquire about preferred seating like an aisle or window seat when available. The agent will then issue your physical boarding pass to pass through security and board the flight. 
### Air Travel Security Screening
With your boarding pass in hand, proceed to the security checkpoint. Remove any metal objects like watches, jewelry, and belts and place them in bins along with laptops, liquids, and aerosols for x-ray screening. Walk through the metal detector and be prepared for a potential random pat-down. On the other side, collect your belongings and make your way to the departure gate. 
### Time in the Airport Terminal
Most airport terminals have **WiFi access and food/beverage concession stands**, though prices tend to be higher than off-airport options. Spend your wait time browsing the internet on your mobile device or treat yourself to a snack. **Be sure to arrive at the departure gate 50 minutes prior** to your scheduled departure time as gates close promptly before every flight.
### Boarding the Aircraft  
When your boarding group is called, present your boarding pass again at the jet bridge or boarding bus entrance. The flight attendant will scan it before allowing you onto the aircraft. Find your seat indicated on your pass and stow carry-on luggage in overhead bins or under the seat in front of you. For a great first flying experience, request an **aisle or window seat** during check-in to take in views of the landscape below. 
### In-Flight Basics
Once all passengers are boarded, flight attendants will provide a **pre-flight safety demonstration** covering evacuation procedures and lifejacket locations. Shortly after, the pilot will introduce themselves and provide an estimated flight time, weather outlook, and cruising altitude over the intercom system. Enjoy the journey and feel free to get up and move around the cabin once the seatbelt sign is turned off during cruising portions of the flight.
### Arriving at Your Destination Airport  
Near the end of the flight, flight attendants will ensure all passenger belongings are stowed and seatbacks and tray tables are in their full upright position for landing. After a smooth touchdown, follow signs pointing you to the terminal for immigration and baggage claim. From there, you've successfully completed your first air travel experience within India!
### Booking Tickets in Advance 
When booking flight tickets, try using **incognito mode in your web browser** or **clear your cache and browsing history regularly** to get more competitive airfares. Ticket prices tend to increase as your scheduled travel dates approach and the more frequently you search, so researching and purchasing well ahead of time is recommended. Some helpful tips include comparing multiple airlines and dates for the best rates, opting for budget carriers if on a tighter budget, and signing up for frequent flyer programs to earn miles for future travel. Regardless of when or how you book, always double check your itinerary, timings, and other trip details before arriving at the airport. Happy journeys!
