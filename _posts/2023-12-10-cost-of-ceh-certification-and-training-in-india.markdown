## Choosing the right institute 
When it comes to obtaining the CEH certification, choosing the right training institute is crucial. Some key aspects to consider include reputation, experience in delivering the course curriculum effectively, certification success rate of past students, practical hands-on training and cost. After evaluating different institutes, Mercury Solutions and Nexson IT Academy emerged as top options based on their industry expertise and favourable pricing.
### Evaluating course content
The CEH certification training covers a comprehensive range of [cyber security domains](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-custom-proud-football-grandma-number-28-personalized-women-v-neck-t-shirt/women&) including topics such as network security, risk management, social engineering, cryptography, penetration testing methodologies and tools like Metasploit. It is important to ensure the institute covers all the key areas listed in the EC-Council CEH blueprint to help students learn the practical skills required to perform ethical hacking techniques proficiently.

### Hands-on learning approach 
While theory lessons are necessary to build foundations, **hands-on learning** through real-world scenarios and exercises is critical for skills development in this field. Reputed institutes like Mercury Solutions and Nexson provide sufficient lab sessions with tools and virtual environments for students to experiment with different techniques learned in class. This reinforced learning approach aids better retention of concepts.
## Cost of training and certification 
The total cost of CEH training along with the certification exam varies depending on factors such as the institute, city, study mode (online vs offline) and additional services. Some key points:
- In Hyderabad, the average training cost ranges between Rs. 8,000 to 12,000 per student for a 5-day classroom program at institutes like Hackers School. 
- The EC-Council charges around Rs. 20,000 for taking the CEH certification exam online. 
- So the total expense of training and certification would be around Rs. 28,000 to Rs. 32,000.
- For highly specialized and experienced institutes offering a more immersive learning experience through extensive hands-on labs and small batch sizes, the training fees may be higher around Rs. 15,000-20,000.
- Top institutes like Nexson provide highly competitive packaged rates for both training and certification at around Rs. 40,000, which is very cost-effective compared to availing them separately.
## Financing options
For students with budget constraints, institutes often provide the following financing support:
### Payment installments 
Some institutes allow splitting the program fee into affordable monthly installments without additional charges to help manage cashflows better. This makes the certification accessible to more aspirants.
### Scholarships 
Top performers in previous qualifications or from economically weaker sections may qualify for partial or full fee waivers through merit-cum-means scholarships offered by institutes annually based on eligibility criteria.  
### Bank education loans 
Popular banks provide education loans at low interest rates for skills-based technical courses like CEH. The repayment tenure typically ranges from 5-7 years post-course enabling students to learn without immediate fund outflow burden. Institutes help facilitate and process such loan applications seamlessly.
## Certification benefits and job prospects
Obtaining **EC-Council CEH certification** validates aspirants' knowledge and skills in ethical hacking techniques legally and responsibly through a standardized, globally recognized program. Some key advantages include: 
- Opening up opportunities in lucrative roles in cyber security operations centres, vulnerability assessment & penetration testing domains of top organizations. 
- Commanding higher salaries (often 30-50% over non-certified peers) in both national and multinational firms in the information security industry vertical. 
- Staying updated with latest trends through EC-Council's continuous professional development framework with certifications like CEH Practitioner helping to upskill throughout careers.
- Gaining a competitive advantage over peers without certifications as employers strongly prioritize certified candidates for cyber security openings.
