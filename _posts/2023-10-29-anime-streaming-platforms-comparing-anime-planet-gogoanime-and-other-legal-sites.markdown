### Licensing and Partnerships Ensure Legal Streaming
While free to use, Anime Planet supports its content through licensing agreements with major streaming platforms. All episodes available to watch are partnered with companies like Crunchyroll, Hulu, and Viki to play official streams. The site also hosts legally uploaded anime music videos, vocaloid music, and animator shorts pulled directly from YouTube. However, geographic restrictions may apply depending on which titles each country's partners hold rights to stream. Through strategic partnerships, Anime Planet provides a safe, legal way for fans worldwide to access a wide **selection of subtitled and dubbed anime shows.**
### Alternative: Gogoanime for a Wider Range of Content  
For those seeking an even broader catalog of anime to choose from, Gogoanime is another strong option. Unlike Anime Planet which focuses primarily on more popular and legally licensed titles, Gogoanime hosts a much larger archive of shows. This includes more obscure anime as well as episodes that have been fan-subbed rather than officially translated. The downside is content on Gogoanime runs a higher risk of being taken down due to licensing issues. However, the site maintains consistently fast servers to stream from and offers simple navigation between genres and categories. Overall Gogoanime provides anime fans with a greater depth of lesser known titles to discover at the cost of less stability.
### Safety Considerations for Free Streaming
While legal and safe in many regions, free anime streaming does carry some inherent risks to be aware of. Server speeds and uptime can vary between platforms. Popups or ads on pirate sites may contain malware. And geographic licensing restrictions could block certain regions' access no matter the site. For these reasons, paid services like Crunchyroll often provide the most seamless, secure experience. Minor annoyances like intermittent buffering are a small price to pay for fully legal, high quality streams of the most popular new and catalog anime available today. Consumers must weigh benefits of selection versus risks to privacy when choosing between free and premium options.
### Evaluating Different Platforms Based on Individual Needs  
In the end, the best anime streaming service depends on each user's preferences and location. For simple legal watching and trackable history, Anime Planet remains a great free choice. Users seeking a extensive back catalog should consider sites like Gogoanime alongside privacy risks. And experienced fans looking for the smoothest premium experience will be happiest with subscriptions to Crunchyroll, Funimation, or Hulu. Taking time to research features and policies of different platforms empowers anime lovers to choose the one catering closest to their individual streaming needs and comfort levels. With so many quality legal options available, there is no need to settle or take unnecessary digital risks to enjoy this beloved art form.
### Summary and Recommendations
In conclusion, the anime community is lucky to have various streaming options both free and paid. Anime Planet excels for newcomers wanting basic legal access and history tracking. More extensive collections at sites like Gogoanime appeal to specific needs but carry more uncertainties. Overall, Crunchyroll leads the market with the biggest budgets for fast, high-quality streams across all devices. Regardless of platform, fans should feel empowered to safely explore this amazing medium through services respecting artists' works with proper licensing. Choosing services that give back to the industry will help ensure anime continues to thrive for generations of fans to come.
