### Realizing the Dream  
I have had a passion for computers since my school days. Though I did not prepare seriously for JEE, I managed to get into a government college for my Bachelor's in Computer Science which I realized had limited job prospects. That's when I remembered my childhood dream of studying at an NIT and decided to prepare for GATE exam to make that dream a reality. I started self-studying various [GATE computer science subjects](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/dog-father) such as discrete mathematics, data structures, algorithms, networking, operating systems, programming languages and databases consistently for 3-4 hours daily over a year while also giving mock tests.

### Facing Adversities  
Though I worked hard, my college had limited resources which made it difficult to grasp advanced concepts. Also, when I secured a **job in the IT sector** after graduating, people around me discouraged me from continuing GATE preparation. But I believed in my dream and kept preparing part-time along with my job, revising concepts from online video lectures. However, managing both job and studies affected my focus. Come exam day, due to lack of consistent practice of full mock tests, I could not utilize the full time and missed out on some easy marks, scoring less than expected.
### Fighting All Odds
Despite the setback, I did not lose hope and re-dusted myself to prepare again the next year. This time, I left my job and joined a reputed coaching institute in Delhi to focus solely on GATE preparation. With discipline and consistent practice of tons of mock tests over 8 months using study materials from multiple sources, I ensured in-depth learning of **algorithms, operating systems, computer networks** and other topics testing my knowledge to the maximum. On exam day, I was well prepared and scored well but still fell short of the mark for a top NIT/IIT due to the highly competitive nature of the exam.  
### Turning Point 
Though disappointed twice, I was determined to crack GATE. In my final year at NIT, I continued self-studying part-time along with academics, revising concepts from my notes and giving mock tests. Come GATE 2019, with relaxed preparation focusing more on gaining experience than outcome, I surprised myself by scoring decently. This opened up opportunities to try for prestigious **MS programs at older IITs** through interviews which became my new goal. I prepared for interviews by upskilling in areas like machine learning, data science and programming through online courses and assignments.
### Achieving the Unthinkable
With perseverance and hard work, I miraculously cleared interviews at top institutions like IIT Bombay, IIT Delhi and **got selected for the MS program at IISc Bangalore**, fulfilling my childhood dream. I proved that with determination, one can overcome all challenges and accomplish what may seem unthinkable initially. My advice to aspirants is to never lose hope, learn from mistakes, and keep pushing your limits with each attempt to eventually succeed. My unpredictable yet rewarding GATE journey is a testament to the power of grit and resilience.
### Making the Most of Opportunities
At IISc, I focused on sharpening my skills in **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Analysis** and took up research projects in these domains. I also gave interviews for prestigious programs at older IITs and research institutes like IITH and IITG, and received admit offers which gave me multiple choices to pick from. Weighing all options, I finally joined the MS program at IIT Madras. Here I got opportunities to work with eminent professors and carry out impactful research work. After graduation, I joined a leading tech company, unlocking my true potential through continuous learning and making the most of every opportunity that came my way.
### Paying it Forward
Reflecting on my long journey, I understand the value of perseverance, self-belief and having the right guidance. To help other aspirants facing similar challenges, I started sharing my GATE preparation strategies and learnings online. I also conduct regular mentorship sessions discussing effective study techniques, time management tips, dealing with failures and stress management skills. My aim is to motivate and empower students to have faith in themselves and keep chasing their goals no matter the hurdles. If my story could inspire even one aspirant to never give up on their dreams, it would be the biggest reward for me.
### Success Stories Never End 
As I look back at my transformation from an average student with average ranks to securing a prestigious MS degree, I feel a deep sense of pride and gratitude. My perseverance taught me that success stories never have a full stop, they keep progressing. Even after my MS, I wanted to maximize my learning and joined the prestigious PhD program at IISc Bangalore. Here I am pursuing cutting-edge research in **Machine Learning, Neural Networks** and Artificial Intelligence domains under renowned professors. With each achievement, my zeal for learning new things and chasing bigger goals only grows stronger. My journey reiterates that hardwork and resilience can make even the most difficult dreams come true.
