## Getting Started
To start your modding journey, you'll first need to download Forge for your version of Minecraft. This allows you to play with custom mods added to your game. Some popular places to find mods are CurseForge, the Minecraft Forums, and PlanetMinecraft.
You'll want to check that any mods you download are compatible with your version of Forge and Minecraft. Most active mods target the latest 1.12.2 version as this remains very popular in the modded community. However, some authors rapidly update their works for newer releases.
### Downloading Forge
Navigate to the official [Forge downloads page](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cow-farmer-i-love-farm-things-i-do-in-my-spare-time-funny-v-neck-t-shirt/men&) at [http://files.minecraftforge.net/](http://files.minecraftforge.net/) and grab the installer for your chosen Minecraft version. Run the executable and launch your game once to set up the necessary modding files and folders.

### Adding Your First Mods
With Forge installed, locate your `.minecraft/mods` folder, usually found at `%appdata%`. Place any downloaded `.jar` mod files directly inside here. Relaunch Minecraft and they will automatically load. 
### CurseForge
One of the largest mod hosting sites is **CurseForge** at [http://curseforge.com](http://curseforge.com). You can browse thousands of mods spanning all versions, download with a single click, and track update notifications. Many well known mods exclusively release through here.
## Configuring Modpacks
Once you have a few mods installed, you may notice compatibility issues or redundancy. This is where using a pre-configured **modpack** can save frustration. Two popular options for downloading curated packs are the Twitch desktop app and the Technic Launcher.
### Twitch Launcher
The free **Twitch app** has a robust catalog of custom modpack instances accessible from within the Minecraft section. Simply browse packs for your desired version, click "Get More Content" and wait for it to download everything needed for a seamless modded experience. 
### Technic Launcher 
Alternatively, the **Technic Launcher** at [https://www.technicpack.net/](https://www.technicpack.net/) hosts many popular expert-level modpacks requiring powerful PCs. After downloading, navigate its modpack library for cookied cutter modded worlds or adventures.
## Advanced Modding
Once you have the basics down, many more doors open up. You can dive deeper into specific mod wikis, try modding yourself using MCreator, or configure custom modpack profiles through mod profiles in the Twitch app. Don't be afraid to experiment!
The journey of discovery is what makes modded Minecraft so engaging. By following development on sites like the official Forge pages, you'll stay on top of the latest updates and innovations within the community. Most of all, have fun expanding your horizons in new modded dimensions.
