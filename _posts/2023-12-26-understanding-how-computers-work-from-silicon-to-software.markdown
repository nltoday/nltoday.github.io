## From Atoms to Bits
Matter is composed of tiny building blocks called atoms. Atoms contain electrons that flow as electricity. Engineers discovered how to control the flow of electrons using a semiconductor called a [transistor](https://yt.io.vn/collection/abundis). Transistors act as on/off switches that represent the binary digits 0 and 1. **By combining many transistors in complex circuits**, computers are able to perform calculations by manipulating strings of 0s and 1s.
### Binary Numbers and Logic Gates
Computers use the base-2 number system to represent all data in binary format as sequences of 0s and 1s. **Basic logic functions like AND, OR, and NOT are implemented using electronic components called logic gates.** The behavior of these gates forms the foundation of digital circuitry. For example, an **AND gate only outputs 1 if all its inputs are 1**, otherwise it outputs 0. Combining different types of gates allows for controlling the flow of electrons to perform calculations.

## From Circuits to CPUs
With logic gates providing the basic building blocks, more complex circuits can be constructed. **Registers temporarily store binary values** during processing. **Groups oflogic gates and registers are combined to form arithmetic logic units (ALUs)to perform mathematical and logical operations**. The central processing unit (CPU) contains an ALU along with additional circuits for fetching and decoding instructions. 
### Memory and Storage
To be useful, computers need locations to store programs and data on a more permanent basis. ** semiconductor memory chips such as SRAM and DRAM use electrical charges in transistors to represent bits**. Together with the CPU and peripherals, these constitute the main computer system. Additional **magnetic and optical storage devices like hard disks and DVDs provide high-capacity non-volatile storage.**
## Programming Languages and Operating Systems
While circuits manipulate bits directly, this approach is ineffective for software development. **Higher-level assembly languages were created to provide mnemonic codes for basic instructions.** Later, **general-purpose programming languages like C/C++ offered powerful tools** for creating applications. To manage hardware resources, **operating systems (OS) schedule and coordinate the activities of software**. Popular OS include Windows, macOS, and Linux.
### Compilers and Machine Code
Source code written in programming languages gets converted to machine-readable form through compilers. The **compiler translates human-readable statements into low-level assembly language instructions.** These assembly instructions then get further translated or assembled into **object code consisting of binary machine languageunderstood directly by the CPU.**
## From Hardware to Software Applications
With CPUs, memory, and storage providing the foundation, countless software applications can be built on top of hardware platforms and OSes. **Web browsers parse HTML documents and render visual interfaces for accessing online content.** Email clients enable simple and intuitive messaging. **Document editors create and edit files storing text, images, and other media.** While utilizing underlying system resources, such programs provide easy abstractions for users.
### Graphics, Sound, and Networks
Additional specialty expansion cards contain their own processors to handle specialized tasks. **Graphical processing units (GPUs) accelerate creation and manipulation of images.** **Sound cards interface with audio devices to play and record digital sound.** Network interface cards enable communication over local area networks (LANs) or wide area networks like the internet through protocols like TCP/IP.
## From Electrons to the User Experience
Examining the layers of abstraction unveils the complex interplay between hardware and software that delivers the final experience. **When a user clicks a link or closes a window, an immense cascade of activity occurs across circuits, memory chips, processors, buses, storage devices, networks and more in nanoseconds.** All the while, operating systems seamlessly coordinate it to give the illusion of easy, instant interactions. **From electrons tunneling through transistors to users browsing the web, computers have achieved an almost magical transformation through the combined efforts of hundreds of thousands of engineers over decades.**
### The Path Ahead
Computer technology will only continue advancing on all fronts. **Quantum computing promises new paradigms by harnessing the strange properties of quantum mechanics.** Three-dimensional integrated circuits could miniaturize and densify components. Ultra-low-power designs may realize ubiquitous, disappearing devices. Machine learning today is improving our relationships with software but also raising questions for tomorrow on ethics, security, privacy and more. Computer science will surely persist in shaping our world in ways we have yet to fully foresee or understand.
Let me know if you need any part of the content expanded on or clarified further. I aimed to provide a coherent high-level overview while covering the key technical aspects at each level of abstraction as requested. Please provide any feedback on how I can improve!
