### Summoning Armor Stands with Limb Control
The first step to manipulating armor stand poses is summoning armor stands that have control over their individual body parts. In Java Edition, armor stands are summoned without limbs by default. To activate limb control, you need to use the `/data merge` command on the armor stand entity and set the `ShowArms` tag to `1`. 
For example, the command: 
`/data merge entity @e[type=armor_stand,limit=1] {ShowArms:1}`
Would give the nearest armor stand the ability to move its arms. This allows you fine-grained control over positioning each limb independently.

### Understanding the Pose Tag Format  
With limb control enabled, you then manipulate the armor stand's pose using the `Pose` tag in a summon or data merge command. Each body part like the head, legs, and arms has its own position defined as an array of three floating point values for X, Y, and Z rotation in degrees.
For example, to summon an armor stand looking straight down, you would use:
`/summon armor_stand ~ ~ ~ {Pose:{Head:[30.0f,0.0f,0.0f]}}`
The numbers before the `.0f` determine the limb's orientation. It's important to familiarize yourself with this [XYZ format](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-but-psycho-bae-darling-crazy-girlfriend-t-shirt/men&) to properly position limbs.
### Posing Individual Limbs
Now that you understand the basics of the Pose tag, you can control individual limbs. A common technique is summoning an armor stand with its arms outstretched. 
To do this, you would use: 
`/summon armor_stand ~ ~ ~ {Pose:{LeftArm:[20.0f,4.0f,20.0f],RightArm:[20.0f,40.0f,30.0f]}}`
Breaking this down, the LeftArm and RightArm entries specify the rotation of each arm independently. You can create a variety of combat poses or gestures by tweaking the arm positions. 
Don't forget about the other body parts too - get creative with leg stances using the `LeftLeg` and `RightLeg` entries in the Pose tag!.
### Applying Rotations Programmatically 
Once you understand how to hard code limb positions, you can start manipulating them **programmatically**. For example, rotate the head to always face a target entity using scoreboard objectives. 
First, set up two dummy scoreboard objectives - one to track the target entity's head rotation and another for the armor stand:
`/scoreboard objectives add lookat dummy` 
`/scoreboard objectives add scan dummy`
Then, on a clock, detect when the target looks a different direction and copy the rotation to the armor stand:
`/execute as @e[tag=target] store result score @s lookat run data get entity @s Rotation[0]`
`/execute as @e[tag=armorStand] store result entity @s Rotation[0] float 0.1 run scoreboard players get @e[tag=target] lookat`
Now the armor stand will smoothly track the target entity's head movement. The possibilities are endless!
### Combining Techniques for Complex Poses
At this point, you have the fundamentals down to precisely control an armor stand's pose using either raw commands or scoreboard driven automation. The next step is combining techniques for more complex situations.
A cool effect is having an armor stand subtly mimic player movements. Set up a trigger when the player sneaks to summon an offset clone with /clone. Then use scoreboards to smoothly interpolate the clone's limb rotations between the player's current and previous poses over several ticks.
You could also animate attack or jump animations. Summon multiple armor stands in a sequence with slightly varied poses. Then use chain command blocks and the Statistic modify command to playback the sequence frame-by-frame when needed.
With some creativity, complex cinematic scenes can be achieved entirely with command driven armor stand puppetry alone!
### Advanced Configurations with Data Packs
For permanent or shared solutions, consider using data packs which allow saving command configurations independently of world saves. Common uses include character skins and pre-built animations.
For example, a data pack could define 20 different combat pose functions applied randomly on armor stand summon. Item or block interactions could then playback these sequences.
Datapacks also open up armor stand manipulation to command novices. Preconfigured functions remove the technical barriers, while still achieving intricate puppetry seen in machinimas. 
Proper use of functions, tags, and events allows data packs focusing on the creative uses of armor stands rather than low-level command coding - a powerful approach for both solo and multiplayer projects alike.
### A Foundation for Technical Productions
With a deep understanding of armor stand **pose manipulation** and **command automation**, the possibilities are endless for technical cinematic productions entirely within Minecraft. Stop motion animations, character rigs, intricate set pieces - the skillset attained here serves as a foundation.
Whether it be machinimas, technical map showcases, or simply personal creative works, armor stand mastery unlocks a whole new creative paradigm within the game. With some practice, even the most complex cinematic visions can be achieved using only the in-game tools and resources.
So in summary - take the time to learn the ins and outs of pose tag syntax, practice programmatic control, and experiment combining different techniques. This will allow taking full creative advantage of one of Minecraft's most versatile entities for technical works.
