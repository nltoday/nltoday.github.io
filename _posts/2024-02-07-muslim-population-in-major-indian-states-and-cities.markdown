India is known for its religious diversity, with Muslims forming one of the largest minority communities in the country. According to the 2011 census, Muslims make up around 14% of India's total population. Their population distribution varies across different states and union territories. This article provides an overview of the states and cities with significant Muslim populations in India.
### Uttar Pradesh Leads in Total Muslim Numbers 
With nearly 48 million Muslims according to 2023 estimates, Uttar Pradesh has the largest Muslim population of any Indian state. Muslims comprise around 20% of the state's overall population. The towns of Deoband and Saharanpur in Western Uttar Pradesh are well known for their **Muslim educational and socio-political movements**. Deoband is the center of the [Deobandi Islamic movement](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-crazy-havanese-lady-dog-lover-v-neck-t-shirt/men&) which aims to modernize and revive Islamic teachings and practices among Indian Muslims.

### West Bengal Follows Closely Behind
Coming second is West Bengal, which has an estimated Muslim population of 30 million people. Muslims form about 30% of the population in West Bengal, representing a sizable minority community within the state. The city of Murshidabad was once the capital of Bengal and is famous for architectural heritage sites like the **Katra Masjid** dating back to the 18th century. 
### Bihar, Maharashtra Round Off the Top 5 Muslim States  
Bihar ranks third with an estimated 23 million Muslims, comprising around 17.7% of the state's total population. Key Muslim tourist attractions include the tomb of legendary Mughal ruler Sher Shah Suri in Sasaram. Fourth placed Maharashtra is home to about 15 million Muslims or 12% of the population. **Mumbai's Haji Ali Dargah** is a iconic landmark and pilgrimage site for Muslims.
### Northeast India's Assam Has Significant Muslim Presence
Another significant Muslim community resides in the Northeast Indian state of Assam, where they number around 14 million and account for 38-40% of the population according to different estimates. In the Dhubri district of lower Assam, the **majestic Panbari mosque** dating back to the 17th century stands as a important symbol.
### Jammu and Kashmir Has Unique Demographic Profile 
Prior to being made a union territory, Jammu and Kashmir used to be India's only Muslim majority state, with around 70% of the population following Islam. Although no longer a state, the newly formed union territory of Jammu and Kashmir continues to have deep Muslim roots, represented by famous holy places like the **Hazratbal Shrine** in Srinagar.   
### Other Major Muslim Population States
Rounding off the top ten list are the southern states of Kerala and Karnataka, along with northern states like Rajasthan and Gujarat which also boast sizeable Muslim communities. In particular, Kerala has over 10 million Muslims comprising 28% of the population concentrated around heritage mosques. Karnataka and Rajasthan each have 9-8 million Muslims respectively, making up over 10-15% of their overall populations.
### Indian Cities With Significant Muslim Populations
Several Indian cities are also homes to large and influential Muslim populations. Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Lucknow top the list, with Muslims inhabiting distinct neighborhoods in old quarters of these historic cities. Smaller but notable communities also exist in the major urban hubs of Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Chennai and Srinagar. Collectively, these cities highlight India's spirit of religious pluralism through their cultural diversity.
### Rising Muslim Population Trend in India And Globally  
Recent data also indicates Muslims are experiencing higher population growth rates compared to other religious communities both in India and worldwide. This **demographic transition** can be attributed to younger age profiles and higher birth rates within Muslim populations. Scholars note how rapid increases in Muslim numbers have political implications, and in some global instances have allowed Islam to become the dominant faith. Going forward, the changing religious composition will likely impact India's demographic dividend as well as long-term socio-political dynamics.
### Conclusion
In summation, Muslims form an important religious minority across India that is most strongly concentrated within a handful of major states and their historic urban centers. Both their total numbers and proportional strength vary considerably by region. However, Muslims remain firmly integrated within India's multicultural fabric and will continue shaping its demographic outlook into the future. Their rising presence worldwide through the ongoing population transition also bears monitoring in terms of religious and geopolitical power shifts.
