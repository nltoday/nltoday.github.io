Deflection of light is an intricate and fascinating phenomenon in physics that involves many principles from classical mechanics to Einstein's general relativity. Let us dive deeper into the underlying physics behind this curious effect.
### [Gravitational Acceleration and Mass](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/alkire)
Newton was the first to propose that light would undergo gravitational attraction due to its possession of mass, however minute. Any mass, regardless of size, would experience acceleration under gravity based on Newton's second law of motion (**F=ma**). This was corroborated by observations of objects of varying mass like feathers and hammers falling at identical rates on the moon. However, light's constant propagation speed defied the notion of it having tangible rest mass.

### **Propagation Speed and Mass-Energy Equivalence** 
Maxwell's elegant equations describing light established its finite but invariant speed of travel. This aligned with special relativity but posed a challenge to attributing gravitational bending to light's mass. However, through Einstein's insight of **E=mc^2**, energy and mass were revealed as interchangeable. As light carries energy, its momentum allowed for gravitational coupling sans needing tangible rest mass.
### **Flat Spacetime & Newtonian Mechanics**
On a flat spacetime canvas, the Newtonian approach alone could explain light deflection via energy-imbued gravitational acceleration. However, general relativity's key departure is spacetime curvature induced by massive bodies. To discern its unique bent light prediction from Newtonian considerations required deeper analysis.
### **Fermat's Principle & Gravitational Time Dilation** 
Fermat's principle of stationary optical path length informed that light follows the route involving least time. Yet in flat spacetime, a curved path would not minimize elapsed time. Only by incorporating general relativity's gravitational time dilation does a bent ray represent the fastest trajectory. 
### **Factor of Two Distinction**
Accounting for both deflection and relative temporal slowing around gravitating masses, general relativity derived a bending of light by massive bodies precisely double that of Newtonian mechanics on a flat spacetime. This factor of two separatng the theories was empirically validated in Eddington's celebrated solar eclipse observations.
### **Pathways to Discovery**  
While Newton envisioned gravitation as an action at a distance rather than spacetime curvature, had he combined known principles of least action and Fermat's principle of stationary time, he may have discovered aspects of general relativity ahead of Einstein. The mathematical tools existed, though conceptual barriers remained around disentangling gravitational effects from coordinate choices.
In summary, the physics behind gravitational light bending is intricately interconnected with major themes in theoretical physics. Its explanation called upon principles of classical and relativistic mechanics, requiring a fusion of Newtonian, special and general relativistic thought.
