## Gender Discrimination in Public Offices
As highlighted in the story, there is rampant gender discrimination and malpractices occurring in public offices responsible for issuing important documents and licenses in India. Brokers dominate the system and prioritize their clients over deserving candidates. Female candidates particularly face unequal treatment and harassment. Officials turn a blind eye to such crimes, undermining the rule of law. This toxic culture has serious repercussions, jeopardizing road safety. Strict actions must be taken against corrupt practices for a fair and safe society.
### [Unequal treatment of female drivers in license tests](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/achenbach) 
The author witnessed first-hand how female candidates were sent first for the driving test, seemingly to clear them quickly to favor broker's male clients. Officials shamelessly ignored complaints about the brokers' rowdy behavior and dominance. Only broker-recommended candidates, including those incapable of driving, were passed without due process. Such discrimination demoralizes worthy females from pursuing driving careers. Unqualified drivers also endanger others on the roads. Impartial evaluation of all candidates is critical.

## Lack of Safety Measures Hinders Women's Progress
The lack of proper safety infrastructure and deterrence has long restricted women's mobility and career choices in India. Despite their talents and qualifications, many females are unable to pursue their preferred fields or work locations due to well-founded safety concerns. This deprives the nation of valuable human capital and potential. 
### **Fear of violence limits opportunities for women**
The author recalls female classmates unable to take up desired jobs in less safe cities due to family objections. The brutal Hyderabad gang rape shocked the nation but failed to drive significant reforms. While some unfairly blame the victims, the real issue is society's insufficient protection of its women through practical steps. Unless safety is assured, gender equality will remain elusive regardless of progressive laws or open-minded ideals.
## Simple Solutions Can Make a Big Difference
Small but thoughtful measures to ensure safety can go a long way in empowering women. Visiting the United States, the author was pleasantly surprised by some exemplary initiatives.
### **Unobtrusive emergency alarms boost security** 
The campus emergency buttons discreetly positioned near vacant streets allow any uneasy person to immediately call for help. Such convenient safeguards enable females greater freedom and peace of mind in their movements. They avoid needless restrictions while raising others' safety awareness. 
## Need for Holistic yet Pragmatic Reforms  
To establish true gender equity and achieve women's full potentials, India requires comprehensive yet practical reforms. While policies and mindsets also need long-term changes, swift actions to curb corruption, ensure non-discrimination and boost security through low-cost solutions can make an important difference now. By prioritizing women's safety and wellbeing, we invest in our collective progress. Strong political will and public participation are key to building a just, prosperous and humane society for all.
