Creating graphics for print takes understanding the appropriate image type. While Photoshop allows raster graphics, Illustrator specializes in vectors. Let's dive deeper into the key differences between vectors and bitmaps and how each image type works best for print.
### Crisp Edges and Scalability 
Vectors store shapes as math formulas called paths rather than pixels. This allows vectors to scale smoothly to any size without losing quality or sharpness. If you need images with crisp edges that can enlarge flawlessly, vectors are essential. Photoshop bitmaps work well printed at their original size but become pixelated if enlarged. For logos, icons and anything that may print at varying dimensions, vectors are a must.

### Flat Colors and Transparency
Illustrator also excels at working with flat colors and transparency effects. Since vectors define color mathematically rather than through pixels, colors remain true no matter the size. This makes vectors perfect for logos, signage, infographics and other designs using solid colors or transparent elements. Photoshop bitmaps, while color accurate, cannot reproduce these effects as cleanly when scaled.
### Dots Per Inch and Resolution 
For bitmap graphics like photos, resolution measured in dots per inch (DPI) determines quality. Print images require a minimum of 300 DPI to look crisp. Lower resolutions risk pixilation. Photoshop images locked to a certain DPI cannot change size without quality loss. While Photoshop can create 300DPI+ bitmaps, vectors have no such restriction, making them more versatile for multi-sized print projects.
### Rasterizing and Re-Tracing
Of course, you can create vector-like images in Photoshop by tracing bitmap lines and fills. However, complex shapes may not translate perfectly. Enlarging a Photoshop tracing also degrades quality faster than a native vector file. Another option is rasterizing vectors in Photoshop, but this permanently "flattens" the file, losing editable path info. For non-destructive workflows, Illustrator remains the better vector tool. 
### Printing Complex Graphics
When designing technical or informational graphics for print like diagrams, maps, engineering drawings or anything containing many small, precise elements, the precision of vectors is essential. Bumps and gaps from enlarged bitmap pixels could compromise understandability or accuracy. Complex multi-layered graphics also benefit from Illustrator's superior handling of overlapping transparent shapes.
### Combining Raster and Vector Assets
In the end, though, many print projects involve using both raster and vector image types together seamlessly. Photoshop excels at image editing while Illustrator handles vector shapes, fonts and layout. With linked files or copy/pasting between the apps, you gain the benefits of both tools. Understanding each program's strengths helps decide where specific design elements belong for optimal print quality and flexibility across mediums.
