True Detective follows detectives Rust Cohle and Martin Hart over a 17 year period as they investigate a mysterious murder. Through flashbacks we see their interrogation styles evolve and how their characters grow. 
### **Rust Cohle's Cold Rationalism** 
In 1995, Rust Cohle is a hardened and emotionless detective. After the death of his daughter several years prior, he shut down emotionally as a coping mechanism. During interrogations, he is ice cold and calculative in his approach. While effective in getting confessions, there is no empathy or humanity in his questioning.

### **Marty Hart's Outraged Persona**
As Rust's partner, Martin Hart plays the role of "bad cop" by acting outraged and threatening towards suspects. He shouts accusations to intimidate them into talking. However, beneath the angry facade is also a lack of real care or understanding for the individuals he interrogates.
### **Their Effective "Good Cop Bad Cop" Routine** 
Cohle and Hart have honed an interrogation system where Marty portrays the furious detective pushing for answers, then exits, leaving Rust alone with the suspect. Now afraid of Marty's wrath, they open up to Cohle's "understanding" persona, not realizing he feels no empathy either. This "good cop bad cop" ploy breaks many suspects.

By 2012, 17 years later in the investigation, Rust has changed. Facing his daughter's death no longer consumes him. During a final interrogation, he calmly listens without judgment, showing hints of care that were absent before. His hardened shell is cracking as repressed grief emerges.
### **Marty Struggles with Family Versus Work**  
By contrast, Marty continues prioritizing being a macho detective over his children and wife. Arguments at home spill into interrogations where his heated temperament seems partly fueled by private turmoil. Over time, the cost of his choices become clearer as relationships fracture.
### **Rust Achieves Catharsis and Closure**
In the series finale, Rust finally overcomes years of emotional paralysis. While diving into old case files, memories overwhelm him and he breaks down sobbing. Letting go of his pain brings catharsis and a new outlook. His character evolution parallels the mystery coming to a poignant resolution.
### **Interrogation Methods Serve the Plot**
While initially appearing a realistic police process, closer inspection shows Cohle and Hart's questioning serves the unfolding narrative. Their "good cop bad cop" routine perfectly sets up key reveals at climactic moments. Likewise, paralleling Rust's emotional journey with solving the case proves the interrogation scenes skillfully propel the multilayered story.
In conclusion, True Detective depicts the character transformations of Detectives Cohle and Hart through 17 years in a compelling way. Their evolving interrogation styles mirror inner changes while effectively moving the plot mysteries along a sophisticated path. Both procedural police drama and in-depth character study are achieved through this exploration of investigative **techniques** and humanity.
