Over the past few years, I have experienced a bumpy yet rewarding ride in my JEE preparation journey. Going through setbacks, failures and recovering from them stronger has taught me valuable lessons that I will cherish throughout my life. Here is my story in brief:
### Initial Struggles 
I took my first attempt of JEE Mains in January 2020 but did not fare well, scoring only around 50 marks out of 300. Being a [topper in school](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-xmas-lighting-matching-ugly-chihuahua-dog-christmas-81-chihuahua-dog), this result was quite disappointing for me. I scored 83 percentile which further de-motivated me. However, with Board exams approaching, I focussed on my studies and scored well, securing 95.4% marks. This small victory gave me confidence that with **hard work and dedication**, I am capable of achieving more than expected.

### First Taste of Success
I restarted my JEE preparation with full zeal after Board exams got over. In September 2020, I gave another attempt and managed to improve my score to 103 marks with a percentile of 87.15. Though it was still not enough, this increment showed that my efforts were yielding results. However, I was not fully satisfied. I decided to take a drop year and devote all my time for a serious JEE preparation.
### The Grind Begins
The next few months were truly testing times as I focussed solely on **JEE advanced level concepts**. It was challenging both mentally and physically as I restricted myself from any leisure activities. Being alone in this endeavour was tough but it helped me realize my true potential. After months of rigorous practice and self-study, my hard work started paying off. In February 2021, I scored a massive 217 marks with 98.34 percentile, crossing the 225 marks threshold for 99 percentile in my shift.  
### Unexpected Turn of Events
Just when things were falling in place, I tested positive for Covid-19 in March 2021. It took around 1.5 months for me to recover completely. This unexpected event hampered my preparation plans. Instead of despairing, I shifted focus to other activities like gaming and web series during recovery which helped boost my morale. Though I could not study optimally, I managed decent scores of 198 and 138 marks in subsequent attempts held in March and August respectively.
### Glorious Finish
Despite the odds, my cumulative performance was strong enough to secure an AIR of 15090. Getting into the top 16000 ranks was a big achievement considering the lack of preparation in last few months due to Covid. More than the end result, this journey has taught me invaluable life lessons of resilience, patience and keeping an **optimistic approach** during adverse situations.
### Takeaways
Some key things I realized through this experience are - studying is not enough, one must find a balanced lifestyle incorporating hobbies and leisure; mindset plays a huge role in dealing with failures and exams; having **social support** from family and friends eases stress levels. I am grateful for the bumpy yet satisfying journey that has made me a stronger, well-rounded personality today.
