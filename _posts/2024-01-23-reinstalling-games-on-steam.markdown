Steam is one of the leading digital distribution platforms for games on PC. It offers ease of use for downloading and installing games as well as seamless game updates. However, there are a few things users should know about reinstalling games through Steam. Let's break this down into key points:
### Removing and Reinstalling Games
When uninstalling a game from Steam, it does remove all functional game code and executables from your system. However, Steam does keep your saved game data and progress in the cloud. This means that when you reinstall a game later, your saves and achievements will be restored. 
To reinstall, simply search for the game title in your Steam library again and click "Install." Steam will automatically download all required game files from its servers. This allows for easy reinstallation without needing local game installers or files. However, the full game will need to be redownloaded rather than using existing local files.

### [Backing Up Game Files](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-dad-sketch5645-t-shirt) 
While Steam handles save data, some players may wish to backup full game installations for easier reinstallation later without redownloading. This can be done by manually copying the entire game folder, found within your Steam installation directory under "steamapps/common/", to an external hard drive or network location. 
When ready to reinstall, copy those files back to the original location and verify the game files through Steam instead of redownloading. This allows using existing local copies but requires more manual management of game files outside Steam's servers.
### Keeping Installed for Future Access
For players with ample storage space, the easiest option is to simply keep games installed even if not actively playing them. This avoids any need to redownload later since the full game remains locally available on your system. 
Over time as storage needs grow, games played less frequently could then be manually removed to free up space as needed. But initially installing games avoids potential redownload times in the future for quick access again.
### Prioritizing Drive Space for Favorite **longtail-keyword: frequently played games**  
For those with limited storage, carefully consider which games to remove to prioritize space for those played most often. Analyze playtime stats and evaluate if a less frequently used game is worth keeping installed or could be redownloaded later.
This allows maximizing available space for **longtail-keyword: heavily played titles** that see regular usage. Games played only a few times may then be reconsidered for removal since likely worth redownloading later if desired again.
### Utilizing the Steam Cloud
All Steam accounts have access to unlimited cloud save storage through Steam Cloud. This service automatically syncs game saves to Steam's servers so they can be restored when reinstalling a game.
Game settings, preferences and keybind configurations are also supported for select titles. So not only are progression and unlock saves maintained, aspects like graphic settings won't need resetting when coming back to a reinstalled game later.
### Handling Large Game Sizes
Some modern titles especially in genres like AAA story games and MMOs can take up 50GB or more of storage per game. For these **longtail-keyword: storage-intensive titles**, steam does allow verifying game file integrity as an alternative to full redownloads. 
This process checks for any missing or corrupt files and downloads only the differences, saving time over a full reinstall. Regularly running this option helps maintain installs without frequent large redownloads being needed.
### In Summary
With careful file management either using Steam's cloud features or manual backups, reinstalling games is quite straightforward. Understanding options like storage management and download alternatives allows players to customize their approach based on specific needs and hardware limitations. With a little planning, favorite games can remain easily accessible even after needing to be removed temporarily or reinstalled in the future.
