## Potatoes - A Potent Home Remedy
Potatoes are packed with antioxidants and tyrosine which make them highly effective in reducing dark circles and pigmentation around the eyes. Their composition allows them to react chemically with skin amino acids and produce tyrosine which helps lighten dark spots over time. In addition to being affordable and readily available, potatoes are a gentle, chemical-free option to diminish dark circles at home without any side effects. Here are some powerful potato remedies to brighten the undereye area.
### Potato Slices
[One of the simplest potato remedies](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/alkire) is to cut a few thin slices and place them directly on the eyes. The potato juice works to lighten pigmentation while also cooling and soothing the skin. Leave the slices on for 15-20 minutes before rinsing with cool water. This basic technique can be done daily for visible results within a few weeks.
