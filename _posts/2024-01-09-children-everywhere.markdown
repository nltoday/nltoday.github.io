### A morning with family  
I made breakfast for my children this morning, and as they were happily eating, I couldn't help but be distracted by something about my son. His smile and joy were as bright as ever, yet an inexplicable unease grew inside me. Trying to push the strange feeling aside, we continued our day as usual. 
Soon, my children began playing one of their favorite pretend games - taking turns "waking" the other up from their fake sleep with tickles and laughter. Seeing their fun reminded me all too clearly of another little boy who could no longer partake in such innocent games.

### A photo that broke my heart
Snapping photos of my children's play, the realization hit me - my son now looked so much like that boy, [Alan Kurdi](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/abbasi), whose heartbreaking image impacted the world. The toddler who tragically drowned fleeing Syria, and whose lifeless body washed up on a beach, a symbol of the immense suffering so many families face. 
Overcome with emotion, I rushed from the room as tears flowed, grieving for Alan and all the children who will never experience life's simplest joys. How do we convince those left behind that the world is fair, when so much undeserved pain exists?
### A lesson of compassion
Later, my son approached me with a handwritten letter and some coins, eager to share his gift for mummy and daddy. Though small, his kindness reminded that even the youngest among us are capable of compassion. 
We must nurture this goodness in all children, and build a world where none feel the anguish of losing loved ones to violence or living life as refugees. Each child, whether in their homeland or far from home, deserves to feel safe, loved, and able to experience childhood's treasures, from playing pretend to small acts of giving.
### Finding light in dark times
In the coming days, my son continued brightening our world with his creative spirits. A family manual he drew brought smiles, and handwritten messages of love and hope lifted our hearts.  
Through a child's eyes, we are reminded there is still light, even in humanity's darkest of hours. We must protect this light in all children, near and far, and work to dim the causes of their suffering. Only then can we fulfill our duty to the millions of **Alan Kurdis** whose names we'll never know, but whose memory calls us to action.
### A shared humanity
This photo of a young refugee girl in Kuwait especially touched me. Faced with immense loss at such a young age, yet retaining her compassion, she exemplifies humanity's shared hopes. 
How do we help her believe in a just world, and a loving God, after all she's endured? By building that world together, through small and large acts of **kindness across borders**. Her plight, and that of the countless displaced globally, must stir us to compassionate action, not numbness. 
Their fates, and ours, are intertwined - we all wish merely for life, liberty and the chance to thrive. With empathy and moral courage, we can work to ensure all children have that basic right.
### A challenge to all hearts
These experiences, though different, collectively call each of us to examine where we stand - do we turn inward, or open our hands and hearts to those suffering? 
True progress happens through challenging preconceived notions, acknowledging shared pains, and taking **bold steps towards justice and mercy** beyond what's familiar or convenient. 
By embracing our common hopes over perceptions that divide us, and supporting practical solutions that uplift the downtrodden, we move closer to a world where no child fears tomorrow, and all may live as this young girl and Alan Kurdi deserved - free, and surrounded by love.
### A vision of a better world  
While immense challenges remain, growing voices worldwide offer hope. Through determined grassroots efforts and global movements promoting compassion and human rights,  minds and policies are shifting.
If we sustain this momentum, future generations may look back on these times not with shame for what we accepted, but admiration for how citizens of conscience came together across divides, launched durable solutions, and helped **rewrite history** in our children's favor.
The road is long, but step by step, act by act, and heart by heart, a brighter destiny can be realized. For all our sakes, and generations to come, may we choosing walking together toward it.
