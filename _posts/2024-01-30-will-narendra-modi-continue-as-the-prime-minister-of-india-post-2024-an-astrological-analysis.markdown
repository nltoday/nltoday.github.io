### The Early Life of Narendra Modi
Narendra Modi was born in a [modest family](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-crazy-boston-terrier-lady-dog-lover-v-neck-t-shirt/men&) in Gujarat and helped his father sell **tea in his childhood**. The positioning of planets in his birth chart indicates **struggles in early life** and a **weak economic condition**. Jupiter, the planet signifying wealth and fortune, is retrograde and aspected by malefic planets Mars and Saturn, showing difficulties. Saturn's aspect on Jupiter further added to the problems. The **Moon being in debilitation** with Mars also hints at **sufferings during childhood**.

### Marriage and Family Life  
While **marriage was inevitable** for Modi as seen by the planetary indications, his **married life and family relations were impacted**. Venus placed with Saturn, the karaka of death and problems, and Moon debilitated in the seventh house of marriage showed troubles ahead. The 12th house of pleasures from Venus had an afflicted lord and was aspected by malefics. The 4th house of family life from Venus had a debilitated Moon aspected by Rahu, indicating disturbances. These dashas brought about changes leading to Modi leaving his family at a young age.
### Early Career and Growth
At age 28, when Jupiter was in the sign of **Aries without afflictions**, Modi took on his first responsibility as a **regional organizer in the RSS**, starting his growth. By age 37-48, in the Jupiter mahadasha of **Taurus**, his career saw **major improvements** through varioushappenings that brought him **national recognition**. He also established a school in Ahmedabad during this phase.  
### Fame, Success and Controversies 
The positioning of the Sun, the karaka of fame, trapped between malefics Saturn and Ketu shows **controversies throughout life**. The **Moon's debilitation** and association with Mars and Rahu point to **scandals, troubles and imprisonment fears** for Modi. However, **emerging victorious from challenges** is indicated by Moon having a **neech bhang yoga**. This played out when the court acquitted him of all charges in 2012.
### Journey to the Prime Ministership 
During 51-60 years, the most dramatic changes occurred for Modi with Jupiter's transit to **Gemini**. The **exalted Mercury** in Gemini's ruling sign Virgo along with benefic placements brought him the role of Gujarat CM in 2002. In 2014, with Jupiter in **Taurus again**, he took oath as the Prime Minister of India. Currently in his 61-72 year cycle with Jupiter in **Cancer**, Modi continues at the helm.
### Decoding the timelines through Bhrigu Nandi principles
To get a deeper understanding, let's examine the progressions based on Jupiter's 12 year cycles moving through signs proposed by Bhrigu Nandi concepts. This gives greater clarity on the **timeline of key events** in Modi's life and their astrological precipitators. But how does the chart indicate his continuance post 2024? Let's analyze further.
### Predicting 2024 and Beyond 
In 2024, Jupiter would be transiting **Leo**, a fixed sign. Saturn here though inimical, is **Vargottama** and **exalted Venus** provides support. More crucially, **Sun with exalted Mercury** in the second house relates strongly to the **second house** and its lord. While Sun is between Saturn and Ketu, the positioning isn't outrightly problematic. Hence, the indications are that Modi would continue as PM till his current 73-84 year cycle ends in 2028, starting when in 2024 Jupiter is in **Leo**. Beyond that, predictions cannot be conclusive. However, his chart undoubtedly shows the ability to optimize results through selfless and focused **Karma Yoga**.
### Conclusion
A detailed analysis of Narendra Modi's birth chart without using the actual birth time reveals how placements indicate his **journey from a modest beginning to India's Prime Ministership**. Certain controversial phases were also on the cards. More importantly, it provides the **timeline of key personal and political milestones** through Bhrigu Nandi principles. While astrology can never singularly determine future, the broader picture emerging from the current planetary placement suggests Modi is set to continue leading India, at least till 2028. Beyond that, only time will tell. But his tryst with destiny seems far from over based on this astrological decoding.
