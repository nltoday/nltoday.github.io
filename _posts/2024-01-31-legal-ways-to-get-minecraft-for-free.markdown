## Completing Offers for Points
One way to get Minecraft free legally is by completing offers and surveys on websites that reward you with points. These points can then be redeemed for various prizes, including free Minecraft gift codes. 
### Earning Points at PointsPrizes.com
PointsPrizes.com is a popular site where you can earn points by completing simple tasks like filling out surveys, watching videos, downloading apps, and more. For each offer or survey you complete, you'll accumulate points in your account. Once you've saved up enough points, you can cash them in to redeem a [free Minecraft gift code](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-matching-holiday-outfits-shiba-inu-dog-christmas-tree-2). While it may take some time grinding through offers, it's a legitimate way to get the full version of the game without spending any money. The site also lets you exchange points for other rewards if you don't want Minecraft. Just be sure to only complete offers that you qualify for.

### Redeeming Points on Other Sites
In addition to PointsPrizes.com, there are several other websites that operate on a similar points-based rewards system. Sites like Swagbucks, Gain.gg and RewardXP also allow users to earn points from online activities that can then be traded in for virtual gifts. Be sure to carefully read the reward redemption policies and checkout processes to ensure you understand how to claim your free Minecraft code once you've accumulated enough points. With patience and perseverance, this is a viable no-cost approach.
## Playing Free Versions Online
Another free option is playing various **Minecraft online versions** directly through your web browser without needing to install anything. This allows you to get a taste of the gameplay at no monetary cost. 
### Eaglercraft - A Browser-Based Recreation  
Eaglercraft is an unofficial but robust recreation of Minecraft built entirely in HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. It allows you to play classic Minecraft survival and creative modes for free right in your browser. Both singleplayer and **multiplayer are supported** through an integrated lobby system. While limited compared to the full game, Eaglercraft is a great starting point for newcomers.
### Other Browser Games Similar to Minecraft
If Eaglercraft isn't working for your browser, alternatives like Minecraft 1.5.2 or ClassiCube also provide browser-playable experiences. While lacking certain features of the paid game, they can still satisfy cravings to build, craft and explore cubed worlds without any downloads required. And for players seeking multiplayer interactions, connecting with others online adds significant length and replay value.
## Trying Official Free Trials
For evaluating the full paid experience, **Mojang and Microsoft regularly offer limited-time free trials** across PC, consoles and mobile platforms. These demos provide restricted access perfect for deciding if the premium version is worth a purchase.
### Minecraft Java & Bedrock Edition Trials on PC  
Both the Java and Bedrock Editions for Windows 10 offer free trials that can be downloaded from minecraft.net. The Java version trial lasts 2 hours while Bedrock allows roughly 1-2 weeks of play before requiring a purchase. Both confine players to a pre-generated survival world but maintain all core gameplay.
### Xbox Game Pass for Console trials  
Xbox owners can get Minecraft free through Xbox Game Pass, which has a $1-for-1-month promotion. Once subscribed, the full games are accessible to play for the duration of the membership. This provides the easiest path to trying Minecraft and its spinoffs like Minecraft Dungeons on Xbox at no long-term cost.
## Wrapping Up Legal Free Options
While outright piracy should always be avoided, the methods above demonstrate there are legitimate avenues for accessing Minecraft in a free or trial capacity through approved avenues. For those seeking to evaluate the experience risk-free before committing funds, the browser games and official trials are recommended starting points. And with enough effort, points-reward programs present a patient path to a free purchased version in the end.
