## Research and Know Your Worth
To negotiate your salary effectively, start by doing your research. Find out the typical salary range for your position and level of experience in your location. Look at sites like Glassdoor and Payscale to get an idea of salaries reported by others in similar roles. 
Consider your skills, accomplishments and any additional value you bring to the role. This will help you determine a target salary range that appropriately reflects your worth. Remember - your worth should be based on the value you provide, not necessarily what you are currently earning.
### [Know Your Negotiating Range for Lead Glassblower Positions](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/abella)
As a lead glassblower, research shows the average salary is around $60,000 per year in your location. With your 10 years of experience and skill at more complex designs, you may be worth closer to $65,000-$70,000 instead. Make sure to back up your target range with your strong track record and relevant credentials.

## Handle the Salary Question Strategically 
### **Avoid Stating a Hard Number**  
When asked for your salary requirements, resist providing an exact figure. This allows the hiring manager less room to negotiate downward. Instead, give a range you feel is fair but also leaves space to potentially get more. For example, say $65,000 to $70,000 rather than a specific $68,000.
### **Turn the Question Back on Them**
You can also deflect slightly by turning the question back. Say something like "What salary range did you have in mind for this position?" This gets the hiring manager to reveal the budget first before you commit to a number. It also allows you to assess if the range seems reasonable before responding.
### **Emphasize Your Value, Not Current Salary**  
If pressed, you can share your current salary but emphasize you seek market value based on experience. Say something like "I make around $X currently but am seeking $Y-$Z to fully utilize my skills and take on these new responsibilities." Don't get boxed into discussing just your current pay.
## Negotiate With Leverage and Willingness to Walk Away
### **Have Competing Offers on Standby** 
research shows that mentioning another competing offer, even if it's not fully secured yet, gives you stronger leverage in negotiations. You can say something like "I'm currently discussing another opportunity in the $X-$Y range." This puts pressure on them to come in higher or risk losing you.
### **Always Be Prepared to Walk Away**
Your willingness to accept less than your target should hinge on your next best option. Prepare to graciously end negotiations if an offer truly doesn't meet your needs and career goals. A hiring manager sensing your readiness to accept almost anything will call your bluff and lowball you. Stick to your market value.
## Handle Rejections and Counteroffers Strategically
### **Ask for Feedback on Rejections**  
If rejected for being out of budget, graciously ask what it would take to be considered. You may find the range is closer than you thought with small compromises on your end. Asking for feedback also leaves the door open if budget changes later. Thank the interviewer for their time in any case.
### **Consider Counteroffers Thoughtfully**  
If they come back lower than your target, don't reject immediately. Ask clarifying questions to assess wiggle room and how a few thousand extra might impact your decision. Give yourself time—a day or two—to consider. Keep in mind you have to live happily with the outcome, so compromise where you can but don't lowball yourself. Your career is worth investing in.
## Stay Confident and Focused on Your Value
Negotiating salary requires confidence in your skills and value. Well-researched salary ranges and backup for your worth will allow you to negotiate from a position of knowledge, not uncertainty or desperation. With a clear understanding of your minimum needs, you can advocate for fair treatment at a given company while still keeping your options open should an agreement not be reached. With focus, research and a willingness to walk away, you have every tool to get paid your market worth.
