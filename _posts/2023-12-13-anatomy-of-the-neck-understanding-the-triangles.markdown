### Superior Aspects of the Neck
The neck is an anatomically complex region due to the many fine structures traversing through it. To help navigate this region, anatomists divide the neck into two large triangles based on bony landmarks and muscle attachments. 
The [sternocleidomastoid muscle](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-dog-training-good-boy-k-lovers-gift-t-shirt) originates from the manubrium of the sternum and medial third of the clavicle. It takes an oblique course superiorly to insert into the mastoid process and lateral aspect of the superior nuchal line. This large fan-shaped muscle acts as the main landmark, dividing the neck into the anterior and posterior cervical triangles.

### Anterior Cervical Triangle
The **anterior cervical triangle** lies anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. This space further subdivides into four smaller triangles based on muscular attachments. 
The **submental triangle** is outlined superiorly by the body and greater horns of the **hyoid bone**. The anterior belly of the **digastric muscle** and midline of the neck form its boundaries. 
The **muscular triangle** is bounded superiorly by the hyoid bone, with the sternocleidomastoid muscle and superior belly of the **omohyoid muscle** forming its lateral and medial borders respectively.
### Contents of the Anterior Triangle
The triangles of the neck provide an anatomical framework to house various vital structures passing through this region. 
Within the anterior triangle lie the **strap muscles** such as the infrahyoid muscles. The **vascular bundle** containing the carotid artery, internal jugular vein and vagus nerve, known as the carotid sheath, also traverses this space. 
Some importantly, the **lymph nodes** of the neck, including the submandibular nodes, are located here. These help filter lymph draining from the head and neck regions.
### Posterior Cervical Triangle
Posterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle lies the **posterior cervical triangle**. Its boundaries include the posterior edge of sternocleidomastoid, anterior border of trapezius muscle and middle third of clavicle.
### Clinical Importance of Understanding Neck Triangles
A working knowledge of neck anatomy is indispensable for clinicians. The neck triangles aid in localizing pathologies like lymphadenopathy or tumors. 
Palpating enlarged lymph nodes in the submental region implies infections of the oral cavity for example. Goitres or laryngeal cancers usually manifest in the suprasternal space.
During procedures such as thyroidectomy or carotid endarterectomy, careful dissection is needed to avoid injury to nerves like the spinal accessory or recurrent laryngeal within these triangles.
Mastering neck surface anatomy using the triangle concept helps surgeons and clinicians efficiently navigate this complex region and improve patient outcomes.
