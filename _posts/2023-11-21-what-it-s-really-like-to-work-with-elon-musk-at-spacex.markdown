### Ups and Downs of Rocket Launches
SpaceX's third Falcon 1 launch in 2008 ended in failure after the first and second stages collided shortly after separating. [Elon Musk](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/dog-dad), SpaceX Chairman and CEO, remained determined to succeed despite facing immense pressure and competition. His former employees recall the defining moment and Musk's impressive leadership in response. While Musk pushes boundaries, the challenges come with tremendous reward and growth for those who accept the discomfort.

### Identifying Causes and Moving Forward
Within hours of the failed launch, SpaceX's technical teams started reviewing data to determine the root cause. Most investigations take weeks or months, but they identified the issue in a matter of hours. By early August, SpaceX publicly shared results to retain trust during this difficult time. In just 7 weeks, another rocket was manufactured, integrated and ready - an unprecedented turnaround others couldn't achieve in less than 6 months with unlimited resources.
### Achieving Orbital Success 
On September 28, 2008, SpaceX achieved their first successful orbital launch from Kwajalein Atoll, becoming the sixth entity in history to orbit Earth. This victory proved SpaceX's dedication and technical abilities. Musk's leadership through failure and criticism helped forge the team's perseverance. Now, SpaceX regularly launches **Falcon 9** rockets and supplies cargo to the International Space Station. 
### Demanding Standards in the Workplace
Former recruiters describe Musk's intensity in interviews for critical roles. He directly meets with prospective hires to thoroughly evaluate their qualifications. Those who work at SpaceX experience both opportunities and challenges from Musk's high expectations. While meetings can be stressful, employees appreciate pushing boundaries at the forefront of space technology.
### Musk's Extraordinary Intelligence 
Recruiters recall Musk's extraordinary intelligence, calling him "scary smart." His understanding spans complex technical details as well as broader business and financial strategies. Associates struggle to keep up with Musk's non-stop work ethic, but remain motivated by his visionary leadership. To succeed alongside Musk requires embracing discomfort and stress to achieve unprecedented results.
### Unwavering Determination
No matter the setbacks or criticisms from competitors, Musk stays determined "to never give up." He transforms failures into lessons and motivates teams through challenges. Associates remark how Musk's speeches inspire instant rallies even in the face of despair. His fortitude forges character and pushes people beyond what they believe possible. Those who accept Musk's standards gain an experience unlike any other company can provide.
### A True Pioneer of Space Travel 
Looking back, Musk's leadership through SpaceX's trials proved instrumental in establishing the company as a leader in space technology. Recounting the emotional experience of their third launch encapsulates Musk's character - undeterred by adversity and driven to accomplish goals far beyond what others deem feasible. For those willing to withstand discomfort, working alongside Musk offers unmatched opportunities to pioneer new frontiers and change the world.
