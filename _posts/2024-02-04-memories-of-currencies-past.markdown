### A Lifetime with the Peseta 
Born in the early 1940s, Manuel has spent most of his life acquainted with the Spanish peseta. As a child, he remembers the bronze-colored "rubia" coin and banknotes as small as 1,000 pesetas. However, he soon grew to dislike the currency due to its consistent loss of value against other major currencies like the US dollar. Exchange rates were artificially set by the government, often much lower than market rates, which robbed emigrants sending money home. Traveling abroad also posed problems, as pesetas were worth 20% less outside of Spain. Despite these struggles, taxes were low during this era.

### Nostalgia for Lower Tax Times
While government services were basic, tax collection was minimal. Manuel feels nostalgia for those days compared to today's "diabolic" 21% value-added tax rates and frequent asset seizures by multiple administrations. In the past, the government financed itself through [money creation](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cow-mom-cute-womens-70s-80s-retro-style-sunset-moo-moo-lover-v-neck-t-shirt/men&), fueling rampant but not extreme inflation over decades. Cinema tickets, for instance, rose from 3 pesetas to 600 by the year 2000. Stable prices, reasonable figures for expensive items, and international travel freedom have replaced those issues since the euro's adoption.
### A Young Italian and a Collapsing Lira
As an Italian man in his mid-20s during the 1970s, he witnessed the lira go into a tailspin. Political incompetence and excess spending combined with oil shocks to induce double-digit inflation. The lira fell from 650 to the US dollar to over 2,200 by 1992. This devastated savers and retirees. Attempts to preserve wealth included real estate purchases, precious metals, and government bonds yielding multiples of the original investment after years. The lira became a international laughingstock, worth less than the yen which Japan previously held at a 2:1 exchange rate.
### A Scornful welcome to Japan  
On a 1982 trip to Tokyo, the traveler's US dollars were exchanged minus a couple stray 1,000 lira notes. The clerk handled them with visible disgust, literally throwing them back as if they were dead cockroaches. The extreme disdain showed just how little the once almighty lira was worth abroad due to political failures at home. While some now question Italy's euro membership, he is proud to use the stable euro worldwide rather than the former punchline currency.
### The French and Their Strange Franc
The French people lacked Germany's passionate attachment to the deutsche mark following World War 1 inflationary horrors. Still, they retained pride in the brave old franc that served for centuries, even as the dollar surpassed ten francs in the unstable 1970s. Strange designs featuring royalty, clergy, and bourgeois artists adorned banknotes in the republic, rather than purely republican figures. In the end, respected scientists and creative icons like Marie and Pierre Curie, Eiffel, and Saint-Exup√©ry gave Francs a nobler image. 
### Nostalgia for Historic European Currencies
Each of these lifelong Europeans recalls formative years shaped by now-defunct national currencies. Generations experienced triumphs and struggles as political failures fuelled inflation and devaluation. Though imperfect symbols of sovereignty, the peseta, lira and franc held cultural meaning for citizens. Transition to the stable euro solved grave economic issues but required adjustment. While newer currencies lack deep roots, their utility encourages pan-European unity and opportunity where old divisions once stood. Memories remain of currencies past, but the future lies in pragmatic cooperation across borders.
