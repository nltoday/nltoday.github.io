### Breaking into the music industry 
Priyanka Chopra has had an illustrious career as an actress in Bollywood films for nearly two decades. In recent years, she has expanded her talents to the international film and television industry. While pursuing roles in Hollywood, Chopra surprisingly announced that she would be releasing her debut single "In My City" in 2020 **featuring will.i.am.** As one of India's biggest stars crossing over into the Western entertainment market, this bold move into music caught many by surprise.

### "In My City" - a catchy but generic start
Featuring a **catchy electronic dance beat,** "In My City" aimed to blend Chopra's Bollywood vocals with an EDM style popular in American pop music. The music video portrayed Chopra as a glamorous global icon traveling the world. However, the song received criticism for being very **formulaic dance-pop without much artistic depth.** Chopra's voice suited the style but she had little creative input beyond the provided track. While commercially accessible, it did not highlight her full vocal abilities.
### Spicing it up with Pitbull on "Exotic"  
For her second single, Chopra collaborated with renowned rapper **Pitbull on the bilingual track "Exotic."** The music incorporated Hindi lyrics alongside Pitbull's trademark rap-singing. Visually, the music video leaned into Pitbull's typical latin-urban aesthetic featuring Chopra as an **alluring femme fatale.** Though derivatively familiar for Pitbull fans, the bilingual crossover element was a creative risk for Chopra. The song's catchy rhythms made it a dancefloor hit despite sparse lyrics.
### Showcasing her range with "I Can't Make You Love Me"
Departing from her featured collaborations, Chopra's cover of **Bonnie Raitt's acclaimed ballad "I Can't Make You Love Me"** allowed her vocal talent to shine. Her rendition retained the emotive vulnerability of the original while adapting it to her Indian classical training. Without flashy production qualities, the cover proved Chopra was more than just a pretty face on pop tracks by demonstrating her nuanced singing abilities on a timeless love song.
### Expanding her artistry with upcoming original songs
Nearly three years after entering the music industry, fans eagerly await Chopra's debut studio album to showcase her full potential. While her first singles gained popularity through star features, original material will define her identity as an artist. Produced by **Anjula Acharia-Bath's record label,** Chopra's upcoming songs are reportedly diversifying her sound beyond formulaic pop. Early reviews of unreleased songs like "Erase" with The Chainsmokers praise her **artistic growth and refined musicianship.** Only time will tell if Chopra can cement her status as a bankable international pop star or respected singer-songwriter.
### Testing her staying power on the music charts  
With several singles already under her belt, Chopra is slowly building buzz for her debut album expected later in 2022. While she gained initial recognition through catchy featured songs, sustained commercial success will require cultivating loyal fans. [Regular live performances](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-crass-christmas-gnome-matching-family-ugly-v-neck-t-shirt/women&) testing her abilities without studio polish will be key to proving herself a permanent fixture, not just a passing curiosity. Chopra's ambition is commendable, but following through with consistently strong original material is necessary to be taken seriously long-term as both an actress and musician.
### Conclusion
Priyanka Chopra made a bold transition into the music industry that expanded her global fame beyond Bollywood. While her earliest singles took a safe commercial approach through star collaborators, glimpses of her artistry in covers suggest promising potential. As a relative newcomer to the field, Chopra is still developing her sound and refining her craft. Her highly anticipated debut album will reveal if she can cement her status as a true recording artist beyond crossover hype. With a dedicated team behind her, Chopra seems determined to prove doubters wrong and make an impact on the international pop scene. Only continued hard work and the test of time will decide her lasting legacy.
