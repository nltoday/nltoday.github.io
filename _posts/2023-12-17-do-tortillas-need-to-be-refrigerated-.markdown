It's common to see tortillas unrefrigerated at the store, regardless of location in the US. Based on amateur experience living in several states, [unrefrigerated corn and flour tortillas](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/alexandre) will last their expiration date of 1-2 months when stored properly in a sealed plastic bag. Refrigerating may double their shelf life. However, tortillas seem forgiving and often last past dates without molding. Unrefrigerated big packs of corn tortillas purchased have never molded. The worst that happens is slight staleness that heating can remedy. So refrigeration isn't necessarily required, but extends shelf life.
### Proper Storage Keeps Tortillas Fresh  
Whether refrigerated or not, it's important to tightly reseal packaging after each use to prevent drying out. Exposure to air is the enemy of fresh tortillas. When packaging indicates to refrigerate after opening, it's likely due to concerns about possible contamination from common taco toppings left on tortillas. Refrigeration reduces risks from other perishable foods. But simply closing bags tightly is sufficient to store unrefrigerated tortillas properly for optimal freshness.

### Freezing Preserves Tortillas Indefinitely  
In a test, flour tortillas stored in the freezer for **over 2 years** tasted just as fresh as the day they were packaged when one package was opened and tested. Freezing prevents deterioration and effectively stops the shelf life clock. Frozen tortillas reheat nicely with any cooking method and make a great instant bread or taco/burrito option. Freezing offers the ultimate solution for long-term tortilla storage with no quality loss.
### Location Impacts Staleness  
The author observed tortillas last longest unrefrigerated where humidity is low, like **arid western states**. In more humid climates, unsealed tortillas dry out and stale faster due to higher moisture in the air. Proper packaging is key to maximizing freshness regardless of storage temperature or location. Pay attention to signs of staleness like brittleness or loss of pliability, which heating can help remedy temporarily.
### Store Based on Intended Use  
For occasional use, standard unrefrigerated storage in a tightly closed package works well. But batches intended to last weeks versus days may benefit from refrigeration. And **bulk quantities of tortillas for frequent tacos** are best frozen for on-demand reheating. Adjust storage methods based on expected timeframe until use and desired freshness level. With care, tortillas can stay edible far longer than expiration dates suggest.
### In Summary  
The most effective tortilla storage depends on several factors, but proper packaging is universally key to maximizing shelf life. Refrigeration or freezing prolongs freshness significantly compared to room temperature storage. And location-specific humidity must be considered. With the right methods, homemade or store-bought tortillas can deliver taco shop quality for much longer than expected. Flexible storage options make tortillas a convenient staple for any kitchen.
