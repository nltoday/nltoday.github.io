### Dirty Business
Professional boxing has long been embroiled in controversy due to **corruption and match-fixing scandals**. While the sport presents itself as a display of athletic talent and bravery between two fighters, the reality is that big money is at stake which has opened the doors for [unethical practices](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/acklin) to creep in. Like any other large profitable enterprise, corruption finds its way in at some level as the financial incentives become just too great to resist for some individuals. 
Famous boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. himself publicly warned Andre Ward against fighting Sergey Kovalev, implying that the bout had been pre-determined to result in a Kovalev victory on points. Mayweather's team was then alleged to have placed large bets on Ward winning instead, netting a massive $40 million profit. While it cannot be confirmed the fight was rigged, these incidents erode fans' trust in the integrity of the sport.

### Subjective Scoring Leads to Disagreement 
Part of the issue also stems from the subjective nature of scoring in professional boxing. Judges observe the fight from different angles ringside and must make split-second decisions on who won each round based on factors like effective aggression, defense and impact of punches. This leaves much room for variation in individual scorecards. 
A high-profile example was the judging of the Canelo Alvarez vs Gennady Golovkin rematch, where one judge controversially scored it wildly in favor of Canelo. While this does not prove corruption, it underscores how subjective scoring can frustrate fans and fuel speculation about bias or outside influence on judges. Formal reviews of scoring may help improve consistency and transparency.
### Small Texas Town Runs a 'Racket'
In the small town of Dumas, Texas, a new racket emerged capitalizing on **marijuana possession arrests**. Being situated along a major interstate route from Colorado, one of the first states to legalize recreational cannabis, Dumas police ramped up traffic stops targeting vehicles with Colorado license plates. 
They do not care about the trivial amounts usually possessed, instead maximizing fines and bail bonds that have become the primary income source for the town. Travelers have been slammed with penalties as high as $5,000 for candy bars containing tiny amounts of THC. The corrupt regime even protects violently criminals with surprisingly low bails. This toxic dynamic demonstrates how prohibition inherently breeds opportunities for **abuse of power**.
### Olympic Boxers Avoid Pro Corruption
The risks of corruption provide part of the explanation for why some highly decorated amateur boxers who medal at the Olympics shy away from turning pro. Without the oversight and rules of amateur competition, pros must navigate the dirty business and shadowy elements that seek to profit from rigging outcomes.  
Even unintentional involvement could seriously damage an athlete's reputation and career. Some prefer to leave the sport with their honor intact rather than risk wading into the murky waters of pro boxing's politicking and unscrupulous deals. For these boxers, **integrity** remains more important than wealth or glory that could be fleeting anyway without a level playing field.
### Cleaning Up a Dirty Business  
However, not all is doomed in pro boxing. Various integrity initiatives have aimed to install safeguards against manipulation of fights and judges. Boxing organizations and state athletic commissions increasingly subject officials to **vetting processes** and mandatory training on proper scoring criteria. Some events now publish scorecards online in real-time for transparency.
Advanced statistical analysis of punch connections also allows outlier judgments to be flagged for further review. Mandating rotation of judges could deter favoritism based on repeat assignments. More must still be done, but reforms show the willingness to reform long-entrenched cultures of **suspicion** that have harmed the sport's appeal. With clean oversight, boxing's vibrant displays of courage and skill might regain prominence on their own merits.
### Ending Abusive 'Drug War' Policies
The outrageous shakedowns targeting motorists in Dumas also demonstrate the policy failures and counterproductive consequences of America's misguided "War on Drugs". Where substances face prohibition, a vast underground economy will arise - and with it, boundless room for exploitation, corruption and human rights abuses perpetrated under the twisted guise of law enforcement. 
Rather than continue empowering police states like Dumas, **decriminalizing** or legalizing cannabis and other drugs represents a saner approach. It redirects focus to public health over criminalization, reduces windfalls for crooked lawmen and restores civil liberties. As seen with marijuana regulation in some US states, a regulated legal market can also curtail dangerous criminal cartels while generating tax revenue. Ending failed drug wars is long overdue to establish a truly just system.
### A Return to Integrity
In summary, restoring integrity must continue as a top priority for professional boxing and other major sports susceptible to match manipulation. Through transparent judging, statistical oversight, and weeding out sources of improper influence, their competitions can regain credibility decided solely based on merits in the ring or field. Moreover, reforming counterproductive drug laws denies pretexts for the abuse of power witnessed in oppressive towns like Dumas, Texas. With determination, integrity can yet win out over corruption in these domains.
