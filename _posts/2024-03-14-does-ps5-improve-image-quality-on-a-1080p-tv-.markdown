### Seeing the Difference
Streaming high resolution videos captured in resolutions like 8K on a 1080p TV allows you to see a noticeable difference in image quality compared to lower resolution content, even though you are not technically viewing in a higher resolution. This is because the higher resolution source material contains more fine detail that still improves the rendered image, even when downscaled to 1080p. It's similar to running a PC game at lower and higher quality settings - the higher setting utilizes the full capability of the GPU for improved visuals, lighting, textures and effects.

### Significant Upgrade on Older Display
Plugging a PS5 into an older 1080p TV from 2016 like the Vizio E Series still provides a visually stunning upgrade over the PS4. Games run at higher and more stable frame rates with richer, more detailed graphics. Things appear less blurry and clunky. While not true 4K, the boost in performance allows the PS5 to better utilize the capabilities of the 1080p display for a next-gen experience.
### OLED Makes the Leap to 4K
Though impressed by the PS5 on their 1080p TV, one owner was amazed when upgrading to an LG OLED 4K display. The difference between 1080p and 4K with [OLED displays](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-weightlifting-funny-deadlift-men-fitness-gym-gifts-tank-top4886-t-shirt) is truly transformative - a "night and day" leap. Next-gen exclusives like **Spider-Man: Miles Morales** and **Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War** showcase incredible detail, whether using **ray tracing for realistic lighting effects** or aiming for 60-120FPS at 4K resolution. The heightened realism leaves one in awe of the graphical potential of new consoles on high-end screens. 
### Lasting Generational Leap with 4K
While 1080p upgrades saw marked improvements, this owner believed the PS5 to 4K transition exceeded even that of the PS3 to 1080p leap years ago. 4K resolution paired with new techniques like ray tracing pushes visual fidelity to another level. Though 1080p still enjoys enhancements, those with the means to upgrade to 4K OLED will be struck by how transformative the image quality becomes for a next-gen experience.
### Ray Tracing Still Shines at 1080p 
Even on a 1080p display, the PS5 can still apply ray tracing techniques to smooth out lighting and effects for a noticeable upgrade over the PS4. While not utilizing the full potential of a 4K screen, ray tracing still makes games appear more advanced and realistic in motion. The improved processing power means 1080p sets still benefit greatly from new console capabilities.
### Strongly Recommending 4K OLED
In the end, both 1080p and 4K displays will delight with what the PS5 can do. But for those able to invest, an OLED screen that supports high-end features like HDR and higher resolutions unlocks a whole new level of graphical fidelity. Between astonishingly detailed textures, nuanced animations, expansive environments and Hollywood-quality lighting, it's an experience that must be seen to be believed. A 4K OLED is absolutely worth it for those seeking the full next-gen visual spectacle from their new console.
