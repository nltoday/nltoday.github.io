Ensemble methods like random forests, bagging, and boosting are powerful machine learning algorithms used for classification and regression tasks. This article discusses the key differences between these three popular ensemble techniques.
### Randomly Sampled Data and Features 
Random forests grow multiple decision trees on randomly sampled data and features. [Each tree is trained on a random subset](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-pug-mom-said-baby-funny-pug-dog-pet-lover-christmas-gifts-2) of samples drawn with replacement from the original training data. In addition, only a random subset of features is considered when looking for the best split at each node. This two-level randomization helps produce uncorrelated trees that lead to better generalization than a single decision tree.

### Averaging Model Predictions
New data is pushed through each tree, and the class that receives the most votes determines the forest's prediction. Averaging predictions from de-correlated trees effectively reduces **variance without increasing bias**, leading to more accurate results compared to a single non-ensemble model. The random subspace method also improves training speed since individual trees only consider a subset of predictors.
### Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging)
Bagging trains each tree on a bootstrap sample of the original data, assigning equal weight to each sample. This creates diversity as about one-third of the data is left out of each bootstrap sample. Like random forests, bagging averages predictions to decrease variance. However, full datasets are used so trees are more correlated. Bagging works best when individual models have high variance.
### Incremental Learning from Mistakes 
Boosting works in a stage-wise fashion, incrementally building an ensemble by adjusting weights of misclassified samples. Initially all weights are equal, but each subsequent tree focuses on difficult cases by increasing their weights. AdaBoost is an example that fits simple decision trees or "weak learners" in a forward stage-wise way to minimize error. 
### Strong Individual Classifiers
Unlike bagging and random forests, boosting exposes subsequent classifiers to the weaknesses of those that came before. This gradual, **step-by-step learning** process forces models to specialize on different parts of the problem, ultimately **resulting in a very powerful ensemble** even with shallow trees. Boosting tends to perform better when individual models have high bias rather than variance.
### Choosing the Right Ensemble Method 
In summary, bagging and random forests work by increasing diversity, while boosting achieves diversity through a sequential process. Bagging and random forests typically **reduce variance caused by overfitting**, while boosting **reduces bias caused by underfitting**. Performance generally improves from bagging to random forests to boosting. The nature of the problem and characteristics of base learners should guide the choice of ensemble method.
### Understanding Tradeoffs
While boosting usually outperforms the others, it is also more complex and prone to overfitting on small datasets. Bagging and random forests are simple to implement and control overfitting well. Overall, these techniques strike different balances in the bias-variance tradeoff. Proper pre-processing, hyperparameter tuning, and preventive measures against overfitting can help unlock their full predictive power.
