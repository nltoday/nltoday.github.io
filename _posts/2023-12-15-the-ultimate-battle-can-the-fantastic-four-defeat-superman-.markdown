### The Fantastic Four's Strengths and Powers
[Reed Richards](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cow-mom-cute-womens-70s-80s-retro-style-sunset-moo-moo-lover-v-neck-t-shirt/women&) possesses the ability of stretching his body to great lengths and strength, making him a formidable opponent able to restrain opponents. As the smartest person in the Marvel universe, Reed would have the intellect to develop counters to Superman's powers if given preparations. 
**Susan Storm** can generate powerful protective force fields that have shown to withstand immense cosmic forces. Her barriers could shield the team from Superman's attacks and allow opportunities to strike. She is a loyal friend who would do anything to protect her family and help Reed's plans.
**Johnny Storm** may not be able to harm Superman directly with his fire powers, but he has the potential to distract and divert the Man of Steel. As the kid brother of Susan, Johnny is willing to support his sister and use his mobility in battles. 
**Ben Grimm** possesses superhuman strength and resilience from his rocky form. While weaker than Superman, he has drawn hidden reserves of power in dire situations and knocked out formidable foes before. As a loyal teammate, Ben would fight relentlessly to buy time for Reed's strategies.

### Reed Richards is the Key to Victory
**Reed Richards** has repeatedly proven to be the most brilliant scientific mind in the Marvel universe. Given preparations, there are multiple ways Reed could potentially defeat Superman. He has reverse engineered technologies far more advanced than what exists on Earth, such as fully analyzing Galactus' abilities. With knowledge of Superman's powers and access to his advanced resources, Reed could develop strategies and weapons specifically designed to overcome the Man of Steel's weaknesses.
### Stalling for Time with the Fantastic Four's Powers
While Superman holds physical advantages in a direct confrontation, the Fantastic Four's varied abilities give them options to stall him. **Susan Storm**'s force fields have shown to withstand immense cosmic forces, allowing her to shield her teammates for periods of time. **Johnny Storm** could use his mobility and fire to distract Superman and lead him away from others. **Ben Grimm**'s superhuman strength and resilience allows him to withstand opponents far stronger than normal humans. Together, the FF using their powers in coordination could potentially keep Superman occupied long enough for Reed's preparations if given warning of the encounter.
### The Ultimate Nullifier: Reed's Cosmic Trump Card 
One of Reed's most powerful resources is the **Ultimate Nullifier** - a device that can utterly erase anything from existence. As the world's smartest man, Reed fully understands the Nullifier's limitless destructive capabilities, having previously wielded it against cosmic threats altering reality itself. If convinced Superman posed a unstoppable danger, Reed would not hesitate to retrieve and activate the Nullifier as an absolute last resort. The Nullifier's power to wipe anything from reality makes it perhaps the one thing in the Marvel universe that could reliably defeat the Man of Steel without other options.
### A Battle of Intelligence: Reed Richards vs Superman
At their core, a fight between the Fantastic Four and Superman comes down to a battle of intelligence between **Reed Richards** and the Man of Steel. With his background in science and decades of experiencing the incredible, Reed has demonstrated problem-solving abilities to take on threats far beyond normal understanding. Given advanced warning and access to his resources, Reed may be able to identify and target Superman's one vulnerabilities that even Kryptonian physiology cannot overcome. In a prepared scenario, Reed Richards would bring his vast intellect to counter even the mightiest of opponents, making victory possible against the Man of Steel himself.
### Conclusion: With Planning, Victory is Plausible
While Superman holds an immediate advantage in power, the Fantastic Four's varied abilities and Reed's genius provides them potential strategies against the Man of Steel. With Reed Richards leading the way using his vast scientific knowledge and resources like the Ultimate Nullifier, the team could plausibly restrain, stall, and ultimately defeat Superman - especially if provided time to plan and strategize. Through coordinated use of their powers combined with Reed's preparations, the Fantastic Four standing together present one of the few potential ways in the Marvel universe to overcome the strongest hero in DC. Working as a family, with Reed Richards guiding them, their victory against Superman is well within the realm of possibility.
