### Farm Life and the Great Outdoors 
I may have retired from my teaching career over a decade ago, but I'm certainly not done running yet. When I turned 50, I bought myself a farm to officially start the next chapter of my life. Managing the land and caring for the animals has given me a true sense of purpose in my retirement. Whether I'm tending to the [pastureland maintenance](https://store.fi.io.vn/i-work-all-day-lohng-so-my-german-shepherd-live-a-good-life) or leisurely riding one of my four horses through the fields when time allows, being surrounded by nature reenergizes my soul. Keeping active on the farm also helps me stay mentally and physically sharp as the years go by.

### Multiple Career Juggling 
In addition to the farm, I've built **successful stock trading** and writing careers that keep me occupied and financially secure in my later years. While teaching was my main job for many years, I was always juggling at least two other ventures on the side. Now that I'm retired from the classroom, I have more flexibility to focus my energy on those additional pursuits. Just because the traditional 9-5 is behind me doesn't mean I'm done working altogether. I believe true retirement is finding meaningful ways to fill your time, not checking out entirely.
### Giving Back Through Board Service
These days, one of my priorities is using my skills and experiences to support worthy causes. I currently serve on the boards of several non-profit organizations focused on areas like education, agriculture and the arts. Providing **strategic guidance** for these groups through governance and fundraising is immensely fulfilling. It's a way for me to continue making a difference even after moving on from my teaching career. While board duties require significant commitment, the rewards of helping others far outweigh any efforts.
### Never Too Old for New Adventures  
While I may have retired from showing horses competitively, that doesn't mean I've given up riding altogether. When circumstances allow, you'll still find me saddling up one of my trusty steeds for a leisurely ride through the countryside. At nearly 60 years young, I have no plans of slowing down either physically or mentally. My father's words always ring true - it's better to keep working at what you love rather than fully retiring. That mindset is what keeps me exploring new hobbies and seizing fresh opportunities well into my later years.
### Far From Idle Retirement  
When I made the decision to retire over a decade ago, I was very cognizant not to simply retire from work but rather to retire to something fulfilling. Idleness has never been in my nature, so fully withdrawing from responsibilities was never part of the plan. I find purpose and satisfaction by dedicating my time to diverse interests like running my farm, trading the market, creative writing and volunteering. Staying actively engaged both mentally and physically is key to a happy, purposeful retirement in my view.
### Wisdom of Experience    
Looking back, I'm grateful for all the valuable life lessons my parents instilled in me from a young age. One saying that always resonated was my father's advice that "instead of working seven days a week, I can work only five." That moderate approach seemed to serve him well in retirement as he took on extensive non-profit work. Now in my 50s and 60s, those formative influences continue shaping my philosophy on making the most of this later season of life. Experience has taught me that true leisure involves productive pursuits, not disengaging completely from meaningful responsibilities.
### Sound Advice for Successful Aging
If I had to share one piece of advice with others on navigating this stage, it would be this - resist becoming idle or fixed in your ways. Retire to new projects and interests that motivate your mind and spirit instead of withdrawal. Staying curious, adaptable and engaged will help you flourish with wisdom, purpose and joy for many years to come. While the future is unwritten, my plan is to keep striving, learning and making a difference for as long as able. Life's best chapters are often the unplanned ones, so I aim to live fully until the very end.
