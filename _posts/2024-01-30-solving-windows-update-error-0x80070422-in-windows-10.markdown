Windows Update is an important feature that Microsoft uses to regularly release security patches, bug fixes, and new features to keep Windows performing at its best. However, users may sometimes encounter errors when trying to install these updates. One such common error is the 0x80070422 error code. This article provides detailed steps to troubleshoot and resolve the Windows Update Error 0x80070422 in Windows 10.
### Checking the Windows Update Service
The 0x80070422 error usually appears when the Windows Update service stops working properly. The first step is to ensure this important service is running as expected. 
The Windows Update service manages the downloading and installation of updates in the background. If it is not running or configured incorrectly, updates will fail to install with error 0x80070422. Users can access the Services interface from the Control Panel or by searching for "Services" to check the status of Windows Update. Make sure it is set to Automatic startup and currently Running. Restarting this service may fix the issue.

### Validating Registry Settings  
Sometimes corrupt or missing registry values can cause the error. One important registry key controls optional/recommended updates. Navigating to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WindowsUpdate\Auto Update` and ensuring the `EnableFeaturedSoftwareData` value is set to `1` fixes it for some. The Windows registry stores critical system configuration data, so editing it incorrectly can cause problems.  
### Restarting Network List Service
As Windows maintains a list of connected networks, a corrupted entry may block updates. Clearing this cache by restarting the Network List Service resolves the issue for many. This service can be found and restarted from the Services interface. Restarting refreshes the network connections and sometimes fixes update failures.
### Running Windows Update Troubleshooter  
The troubleshooter is a useful built-in tool to automatically diagnose and fix common Windows update problems. It analyses the system, detects any potential bugs stopping updates, and often fixes them without any user input. To access it, search for "Troubleshoot settings", select Windows Update from the menu, then click "Run the troubleshooter".  
### Check Windows Store Status
The Windows Store and its underlying services are also essential for installing certain updates, apps and Microsoft Store purchases. Ensuring the Store and its background processes function properly resolves update errors for some users. The Store services can be checked and restarted from the Services interface if needed.
### Using System File Checker
Corrupt or missing system files may cause unexpected behaviors like the 0x80070422 error. System File Checker (SFC) scans for broken important Windows files and replaces them if located. At a command prompt as Administrator, run `sfc /scannow` to check file integrity. `DISM.exe` commands can also be used to verify and repair system image issues.  
### Scan for Malware Infections
Rarely, malware or virus infections on the PC can interfere with the update process, blocking downloads and installations. Running a full malware scan with reputable antivirus software is recommended to detect and remove any potential infections posing as the problem. MalwareBytes and Windows Defender are good free options.
### Reset Windows Update Components  
As a last resort, users can reset the Windows Update components database and cache files to completely remove any corrupted data preventing proper update runs. This forces Windows to rebuild update mechanisms from scratch. Search "Reset Windows Update" in Settings for the option. It requires restating the PC.
With patience and methodical testing of these steps, the mysterious 0x80070422 error preventing Windows updates can usually be resolved. Contacting Microsoft support should only be necessary if all troubleshooting fails to fix the underlying issue. Keeping Windows and its services running optimally is key for security and performance.
