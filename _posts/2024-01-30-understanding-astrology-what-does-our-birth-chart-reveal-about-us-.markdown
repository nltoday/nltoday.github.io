Astrology is a science that studies the positioning and movements of celestial objects and believes they influence human affairs and personalities. One's birth chart, also known as the natal chart, is said to contain important insights into one's personality, talents, challenges and destiny. Let's take a deeper look into the meaning and interpretations of a birth chart.
## Understanding the Basic Elements of a Birth Chart
A birth chart, also called a natal chart, is a map of the sky at the exact time, date and location of your birth. It maps out the positions of the Sun, Moon and planets based on the time you were born. 
### The Twelve Houses
The birth chart is divided into [twelve astrological houses](https://store.fi.io.vn/best-chihuahua-dad-ever-retro-vintage-sunset6832-t-shirt), which represent different areas of human life such as health, career, relationships, creativity and spirituality. Each house has its own meaning and influence on your personality and destiny.

### The Planets  
The planets in your birth chart influence your personality traits, talents, weaknesses and life experiences. Some planets have traditionally beneficial influences like Jupiter and Venus, while others like Saturn and Mars are considered more challenging. Exalted planets or those in their **rulership signs** have enhanced positive effects.
### The Signs
The signs of the zodiac that the planets occupy at your birth also affect your characteristics. For example, someone with their Venus in Libra will express love and relationships differently than someone with Venus in Scorpio. Your ascendant, or rising sign, is particularly influential as it represents your physical body and outward personality.
