## The **US Navy's decades of experience** with aircraft carriers
The US Navy has been continuously operating aircraft carriers since the 1920s, gaining invaluable operational experience through World War II, the Cold War, and various regional conflicts. No other navy comes close to matching the US Navy’s century of learning how to effectively deploy carriers on the front lines. 
China launched its first carrier, the Liaoning, in 2012. However, the Liaoning was purchased nearly complete from Ukraine as an unfinished Soviet aircraft carrier primarily to gain knowledge on carrier operations. Most analysts agree the Liaoning was not a fully functional aircraft carrier. China’s goal was to use the Liaoning as a training platform to develop carrier skills and technologies to build indigenous carriers.
### Mastering Carrier Operations Requires Decades of Refined Experience
It takes many years of trial and error to truly learn how to seamlessly integrate carrier operations within a naval battle group and leverage carriers to their fullest strategic potential. The complex coordination between carriers, escort ships, aircraft, and supporting logistics vessels can only be optimized through extensive real-world experience in diverse combat scenarios and wartime conditions. No amount of simulator training or research can replace decades of refining standard operating procedures through continuous operations in challenging environments.

## Dependence on an [Extensive Logistics Network](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/aispuro)
Aircraft carriers, while powerful force multipliers, rely heavily on a robust logistics network for continuous support at sea. Carriers cannot last long without **replenishing consumables like fuel, food, ordnance**, and embarking spare parts for repairs. Even the most advanced carriers still depend on replenishment ships and overseas ports to stay fully mission capable on deployment. 
### Establishing Global Logistics Takes Time
Building a global logistics chain with strategic ports and resupply agreements takes many years of cultivating international political relations. The US Navy leverage's Washington's diplomatic credibility built over generations to reliably access foreign ports worldwide. Emerging navies will find it difficult to match such a widespread logistics infrastructure for at least several more decades of rapport building overseas.
## Technological Matters are Secondary to Experience 
While size, weapons, and technology are pertinent tactical advantages, they do not directly translate to superior operational proficiency if the human factors of effective command culture and proven tactical integration have not been thoroughly developed through extensive real-world testing.
### People, Not Platforms, Determine Naval Prowess
Aircraft carriers are ultimately reliant on well-trained crews to maximize wartime capabilities. Building a human capital pipeline with top-tier personnel requires decades spent cycling officers through the full spectrum of responsibilities from deckhand to captain. Experience is the ultimate teacher for fostering innovative command skills adaptable to any contingency.
## Staying Power through Continuous **Modernization**
The US Navy understands that technological superiority alone will not last if platforms are left to stagnate once inducted. This is why even the oldest Nimitz-class carriers receive regular hardware and software refreshes to evolving threats.
### Incremental Upgrades Extend Life Cycles
Constant effort is put into researching and applying the latest sensors, weapons, propulsion enhancements, and defensive systems to established carriers. These midlife upgrades allow older hulls to maintain strategic relevance decades after commissioning. Chinese carriers will lack this advantage of continually refreshed capabilities as decades of experience is still being accumulated.
## Interoperability as a Force Multiplier
The US Navy has spent generations developing precise coordination doctrine and interchangeable component designs across all facets of its naval power. Seamless integration between carriers and the full spectrum of escort assets allows each part of the battleforce to exponentially multiply the capabilities of others.
### Interoperability Breeds Lethality 
The synergistic way US carrier groups field integrated layered defenses and conduct joint power projection exemplifies a carefully crafted interoperability impossible for less experienced navies to match at this stage. While new tech may replicate hardware, the software of instinctual coordination between crew and ships can only be honed through extensive real-world integrated operations over many naval conflicts and training exercises.
In conclusion, while hardware continues advancing, experience remains the ultimate arbiter of naval proficiency in high-end combat. No amount of rapid acquisition can make up for the immense strategic learning accumulated by the US Navy continuously operating aircraft carriers for over 95 years through war and peace. Emerging challengers may replicate platforms, but replicating intangible skills developed through generations worth of institutional knowledge and human capital investment remains an exponentially greater challenge.
