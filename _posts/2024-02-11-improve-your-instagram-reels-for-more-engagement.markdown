Instagram is a very popular social media platform known for visual content like photos and videos. Reels, Instagram's version of short-form videos, allows creators to reach wider audiences and grow their accounts. However, some reels may stop playing after just 2 hours. 
As an Instagram user, you would want your reels to reach more people and get engaging for a longer period. This article discusses some common reasons why reels stop playing and provides effective tips to improve your reels for better performance and increased engagement.
## Why Reels May Stop Playing After 2 Hours
There are a few technical and non-technical reasons behind reels stopping to play after only 2 hours on Instagram:
Instagram has certain [guidelines and policies for reels](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-pug-mom-said-baby-funny-pug-dog-pet-lover-christmas-gifts-2). If a reel does not meet these standards regarding content, metadata etc., it may not be eligible to play in the main Instagram Explore feed. Without exposure in Explore, the reel's reach and lifetime gets limited. 
The Instagram algorithm prioritizes reels with **good engagement metrics like views, likes, comments**. Reels not receiving enough user interaction tend to have shorter shelf life and stop autoplaying sooner. Getting insufficient engagement is a red flag for the platform.
You may have manually turned off the **auto-play setting for reels** in your Instagram account. With auto-play disabled, reels won't continue playing automatically in feed and stories. It is advised to keep this setting enabled for better reel performance.
If a reel was removed from Explore due to policy violations or low engagement, it won't be playable anymore on any profile feed or Explore. Getting disqualified from the main Explore feed essentially **kills the reel's discoverability and reach**.
## Common Reasons for Reel Removal from Explore
There can be multiple reasons why an Instagram reel gets removed from Explore, limiting its reach and playtime. Let's discuss some frequent causes of reel removal:
### Copyright or Trademark Infringement 
Using copyrighted music, images, videos or trademarks without proper rights can get a reel taken down instantly for infringement. Always ensure having full ownership or permissions over third party content.

### Policy Violations 
Reels containing harmful, illegal, dangerous or bullying content won't be tolerated. Removals happen if a reel promotes self-harm, violence, adult themes, harassment etc. Stay within Instagram's community guidelines. 
### Low Engagement Signals
If a newly posted reel receives little to no engagement like views or likes organically in first few hours, Instagram may conclude it as less interesting content. Reels need sufficient early momentum to avoid quick removals.
### Overused Hashtags 
Heavy reliance on overly saturated or irrelevant hashtags can render a reel less discoverable. The algorithm may suppress such reels with spammy hashtag strategy. Use search volume optimized hashtags sparingly.
Understanding common removal triggers can help create policy-compliant and engagement-optimized reels with longer shelf life on Instagram. Follow these additional tips for improving your reels.
## Tips to Make Engaging Reels
There are proven techniques to create captivating reels that drive more interaction and reach wider audiences:
### Use Eye-Catching Thumbnail  
The first 3 seconds of a reel act as the preview frame so make sure to choose the most visually striking and engaging thumbnail possible from your reel's video. Test different thumbnail options.
### Optimize for Vertical Video  
Since reels are exclusively vertical format, film your reel content while holding your phone vertically. Avoid landscape videos which tend to perform poorly as reels. 
### Add Music Overlay 
Adding a background music track, preferably a popular sound on Instagram, engages the audio senses and makes the reel more immersive and enjoyable to watch. Always use royalty-free or licensed music.
### Share Frequently on Feed
Instagram promotes accounts that are consistently posting. Share at least 2-3 quality **reels every week on your profile feed** to keep followers engaged and informed about fresh content.
By optimizing reels as per the above techniques and factors, content creators can drive more meaningful engagement and increase the chance of their creels performing well and playing for a longer period on Instagram without glitches. Let's explore additional tactics...
## Leverage Hashtags to Expand Reach 
Few things are as powerful for discovery as optimized hashtag usage. With proper hashtag strategy, you can significantly boost a reel's reach beyond your existing follower base. Here are some effective hashtag best practices:
### Research High-Volume Hashtags 
Use hashtag search or third party tools to identify hashtags related to your niche with highest monthly search volumes. These hashtags tend to get more visibility in Explore.
### Incorporate 2-5 Long Tail Hashtags 
In addition to main hashtags, including 2-5 long tail hashtags containing 3-5 descriptive words packs more context and relevance for your reel. For example, #interiordesignhomeoffice. 
### Target Regional Hashtags
Geo-targeted hashtags help spread your reel among locals. Mention city, state or country hashtags along with general ones. 
### Maintain Hashtag Relevancy
Carefully pick hashtags that genuinely match the topic or theme of your reel without being misleading or spammy. Instagram recognizes unrelated hashtags.
### Monitor Performance of Hashtags
Track which hashtags are driving most views and engagement to your reel. Focus on hashtags with highest ROI for future posts.
By applying these hashtagging best practices, you can significantly boost the chances of getting your high-quality reels discovered by wider Instagram audiences.
## Promote Reels Across Platforms
While optimizing the reel itself for Instagram is key, promoting it across other social networks expands its reach multifold by tapping into untapped new audiences outside Instagram as well. Here are effective promotion tactics:
### Share on LinkedIn 
LinkedIn has a huge professional user base. Sharing relevant business, career or educational reels can garner new followers and fans here. 
### Post on Twitter
Twitter is a great platform to get your creative, viral or entertaining reels in front of masses globally. Don't forget relevant hashtags here too.
### Feature on Facebook/Facebook Groups 
Facebook is the largest social network - share your reel links within relevant public/professional Facebook groups or on your Facebook Page/Profile.
### Mention on Pinterest
For visual content related to recipes, DIYs, designs, crafts - uploading screenshots as pin images on Pinterest drives traffic back to Instagram.
### Pitch to Online Publications
If your reel covers trending topics or tells an inspiring story, reach out to influencer websites, magazines or blogs to feature it. Permanent backlinks prove valuable. 
Promoting reels across associated online communities virtually guarantees additional views, engagement and new Instagram followers - all translating to increased chances of organic discovery within Instagram itself over time too.
## Leverage Instagram Ads for Boosting Reels 
While organic reach tends to fluctuate on Instagram, promoted posts via the platform's business tools offer reliable amplification. Here's using Instagram ads strategically:
### Set Budget & Schedule 
Allocate a daily or weekly promotional budget and schedule re-runs to sustain reach over several weeks for maximum exposure and conversions. 
### Target Right Audiences 
Leverage location, interests, demographics, behaviors and other filters to hyper-target your ideal reel viewer persona. More precise targeting converts to sales.
### Optimize for Conversions 
Besides Website Traffic, install App or Follow actions - promote top performing reels with an optimized Call-To-Action like Shop Now button included. 
### Analyze Metrics
Constantly monitor ad metrics like impressions, reach, frequency, costs, swipe-ups etc. to fine-tune targeting, creative, copy for optimal performance over time. 
Used judiciously along with organic sharing, sponsored promotion through ads elevates reel visibility exponentially and builds a dedicated following interested in your niche content over the long run.
In conclusion, by optimizing reels as per Instagram's technical guidelines and human behavioral patterns, and promoting creatively across associated networks and platforms, content creators can meaningfully improve reel performance indicators like extended visibility, heightened engagement and increased followers in the long run. Regular experimentation and analysis are key to success on Instagram.
