### Early Success and Title Win 
George Foreman started his career with an impressive 21 knockout wins in his first 22 fights to earn a shot at the heavyweight title against then-champion Joe Frazier in 1973. At just 24 years old, Foreman dominated Frazier from the opening bell, unleashing brutal power punches that Frazier had no answers for. In just two rounds, Foreman had **KO'd Frazier** to become the new heavyweight champion of the world in one of the most one-sided beatdowns in boxing history. Many observed that Foreman fought with an unparalleled ferocity and viciousness in his attacks that completely bewildered opponents.

### Defeating Ken Norton and Establishing His Dominance
Later that year, Foreman put on another destructive performance against former Ali opponent Ken Norton. Like Frazier, Norton had gone the distance in two fierce title fights against Ali but could last barely two rounds against the juggernaut that was Foreman, who [floored Norton repeatedly](https://yt.io.vn/collection/aden) until the referee was forced to stop the fight. Foreman was cementing his status as perhaps the most feared heavyweight in boxing with these annihilations of former Ali challengers. His pure knockout power and will to destroy opponents inside the distance set him apart.
### The Rumble in the Jungle and Comeback Victory
However, in 1974, Foreman met his match against Muhammad Ali in one of the most iconic boxing matches ever, known as the "Rumble in the Jungle" in Zaire. Against all odds, Ali was able to withstand Foreman's fearsome attacks and tire him out to score an eighth-round knockout and reclaim his title. This loss seemed to shake Foreman's confidence, and he **retired from boxing at just 26 years old.** But in 1987, Foreman embarked on a remarkable comeback, winning his first 24 fights before earning a second shot at the title by **knocking out** Michael Moorer at age 45 to once again become the oldest heavyweight champion in history.
### Meeting Young Fans and Pursuing Business Interests
Between his two careers, Foreman found great success outside the ring through business ventures and engaging with fans. In 1985, he visited Grapevine High School in Texas where he entertained students for an hour with his charming personality and humor. As the son of a boxer, one student was surprised by Foreman's friendly demeanor, given his fearsome reputation inside the ring. Foreman also capitalized on his fame through business deals, notably selling the **George Foreman Grill,** which has gone on to sell over 100 million units worldwide.
### Analyzing Foreman's Brutal Style and Impact
While some viewed Foreman as simply a slugger, closer examination shows he employed solid **boxing technique,** utilizing an effective jab to set up his power shots. However, in his 1970s prime, Foreman's single-minded goal was always to destroy opponents inside the distance. His performances against Norton and Frazier, who had both gone 12 and 15 rounds with Ali, demonstrated an almost super-human **knockout ability.** Had it not been for the effects of heat exhaustion during his loss to Ali, many believe Foreman could have continued his dominance for over a decade at the top. He established himself as perhaps the most feared heavyweight ever due to his willingness to inflict punishment inside the ring.
### Legacy as One of the All-Time Greats
Despite the Rumble in the Jungle loss, George Foreman's career accomplishments leave no doubt about his place among the sport's immortals. With a career record of 76 wins against just 5 losses, including 68 wins by knockout, Foreman terrorized the heavyweight division with his amazing power for over two decades. Regaining the title at age 45 stood as one of boxing's most unbelievable achievements. Even now in his later years, Foreman remains a beloved figure for fans due to his warmth, humor and business success. He established a legacy as perhaps the most destructive puncher heavyweights have ever seen between the ropes.
