### Hearty Homemade Soups and Stews 
I absolutely [love making soups and stews at home](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/abadie). There's something so satisfying about a hot, homemade meal served in a bowl with thick slices of bread. My approach to soup is always flexible based on what ingredients I have on hand. I'll start by sautéing diced meat like chicken or beef in a pot with butter to deeply flavor the broth. Then I'll add diced vegetables like onions, carrots, cabbage, and turnips which soak up the meaty flavors as they cook. My spice cabinet includes some mystery bottles without labels that I use based on smell - they always seem to make the soup taste delicious! Once everything is simmering, I'll add broth or water along with salt and pepper for flavor. For texture, noodles can be added near the end. With soup, you really can't go wrong as long as you take your time to deeply flavor the broth.

### Family Favorites: Pork Roast and Salmon 
Two recipes that are **favorites among friends and family** are my pork roast and salmon. The pork roast goes into a casserole with mushrooms, brussels sprouts, and leeks which all roast together, infusing the meat with flavor. The secret is using Japanese soy sauce and whole green peppercorns. I like to serve it with a creamy mustard sauce. Salmon gets a simple sprinkle of dill and is served with green asparagus and butter. Both are simple dishes with big flavor that are easy to prepare and clean up.
### Vegetarian Lasagna and Lentil Bolognese  
During my vegetarian years, I became known for an incredible **whole grain lasagna with lentils** that had an umami boost from Japanese soy sauce and tahini. The grain-based noodles, creamy textures from crème fraiche, and savory lentils made it satisfying without meat. This dish shows how simple flavor additions like soy sauce can elevate plant-based recipes.
### Indian Inspired Dishes: Samosas and Aloo Matar Gobi 
Two of my favorite Indian recipes are **samosas and aloo matar gobi.** Samosas are crispy, golden pastries with a spiced potato filling that makes a fun appetizer. The filling includes peas, corn, and spices like ginger and garlic for layers of flavor. Aloo matar gobi is a delicious medley of potatoes, green peas, and cauliflower simmered in a flavorful tomato and spice sauce. Both are easy to make one-pot meals with big appeal. The spices in these dishes never fail to transport me to another culture through flavor. 
### Pakistani Paneer Butter Masala  
Another one of my well-loved recipes is **Paneer Butter Masala**, a Pakistani dish of creamy paneer (cottage cheese) in a rich, complexly spiced tomato and nut sauce. Making the sauce from scratch lets layers of flavor shine through in each bite. Kashmiri chilies, cardamom, cinnamon and poppy seeds give it warmth and depth, while tomatoes, onion and cashews provide body. The finished dish has a perfect balance of textures from soft paneer in a lush, velvety gravy.
### Easy Indian Snack: Aloo Paneer Tikki
For an easy **Indian appetizer or snack**, I enjoy making aloo paneer tikki - fried potato and paneer patties. These fritters combine mashed potatoes, grated paneer, peas, oats, ginger, and spices into patties which are then shallow fried. Serving them with chutneys makes a satisfying starter. The blend of flavors and textures in these tikkis transports me to the streets of India in just a few bites.
### Traditional Indian Desserts: Kheer and Gulab Jamun 
Two classic Indian **desserts** I love preparing are kheer or rice pudding, and gulab jamun doughnut balls. Slowly simmered basmati rice, milk, cardamom and pistachios results in a soothing, subtle pudding. I like decorating it with edible gold or silver leaf for beauty. Gulab jamun involves frying soft, syrup-soaked dough balls that melt in the mouth. Both nourish the soul with warmth and nostalgia for Indian culture through familiar flavors and textures.
### Momos: Tibetan-Style Dumplings
One of my favorite **dumplings to make** is momos from Tibetan cuisine. The wrappers come together quickly while the filling, made from cabbage, carrots, onions and peppers seasoned with garlic and ginger, packs big flavor. I carefully pleat and twist each dumpling before steaming them to perfection. Served with homemade chutney, momos offer comfort through their pillowy skins concealing a savory, hearty filling. The process of making these dumplings by hand bonds me to cultures far from my own.
### Coconut Milk Mango Lassi   
To finish a meal on a refreshing note, I love whipping up homemade **mango lassi,** a yogurt-based drink blended with chunks of sweet mango, milk and a touch of cardamom or cinnamon. Using coconut milk adds another layer of creaminess and exotic flair. The indulgent textures and tropical flavors transport me to balmy days spent sipping thirst-quenching beverages by the beach. Mango lassi is the perfect marriage of two favorite things - mango and yogurt - to satisfy any sweet tooth.
### Rajma - Vegetarian Kidney Bean Curry
One of my regular **weeknight meals** is rajma, an easily assembled vegetarian kidney bean curry full of Indian spice flavors. Simmered red kidney beans are flavored with onions, ginger-garlic paste and a spice blend of coriander, cumin, chili powder and garam masala. Tomato puree adds body to the dish while fresh cilantro on top provides brightness. Rajma is inexpensive to make, packed with protein and flavor, and always goes well with rice or flatbread to soak up every last drop of the flavorful tomato and spice gravy. 
### Traditional Indian Sweets: Gulab Jamun and Kheer
Some of my favorite **Indian desserts** to prepare are gulab jamun and kheer. Gulab jamun involves deep frying dough balls made from milk powder, flour and baking soda, then soaking them in cardamom-scented syrup until soft and tender. The process yields melt-in-your mouth balls perfect for nights in. For kheer or rice pudding, basmati rice, nutmeg, pistachios and saffron-infused milk are simmered into a comforting, subtly sweet treat that soothes both body and soul. Both classics satiate any craving for familiar flavors of home.
### Paneer Kathi Roll - Savory Handheld Snack
A fun handheld snack I developed is the **paneer kathi roll,** filling rotis or flatbread with a chicken tikka-inspired paneer (Indian cottage cheese) mixture. I combine paneer cubes with sauteed onions, green peppers, ginger-garlic paste and Indian spices like cumin and coriander. Rolling it up neatly in rotis before cutting yields portable parcels of warm, savory flavor to enjoy on the go or with friends. Serving it with tart green chutney adds another layer of zest. The rolls satisfy both taste buds and convenience needs.
### Mango Lassi - Yogurt Cooler
On hot days, I love whipping up refreshing **mango lassi**, an Indian yogurt drink blended with chunks of ripe mango, milk and a pinch of cardamom or cinnamon. Its creamy texture and tropical flavors transport me to balmy beaches, calling to mind carefree times spent sipping hand-cut juices by the sea. Mango lassi is an elegant marriage of two favorite ingredients - mango and yogurt - that is simple to throw together yet deeply satisfying. It's the perfect thirst-quencher to conclude a meal on a sweet note during warm weather months.
### Momos: Tibetan Dumplings
One of my favorite things to make are **Momos, Tibetan-style dumplings** stuffed with a savory cabbage, carrot and herb filling. To start, I make the pliable dumpling wrapper dough by kneading together flour, water, salt and oil until smooth. Then, I finely dice onions, carrots, cabbage and season them with garlic, ginger along with soy sauce, salt and black pepper to create the hearty stuffing. Rolling out the dough into thin wrappers, I place a tablespoon of filling in the center of each round before gathering and pleating the edges to form half-moon shapes. Steaming batch after batch yields tender parcels bursting with flavor to serve with chili-ginger sauce for dipping. The process of crafting each dumpling by hand adds to the enjoyment and cultural connection.
