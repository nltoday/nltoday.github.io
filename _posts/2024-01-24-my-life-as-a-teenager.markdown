### New Beginnings  
Adjusting to a new school is never easy, but moving to yet another new country and continent brought on a whole new set of challenges. As the new kid many times over, I've had to learn to make friends quickly and adapt to different cultures and educational systems. The experiences have given me a wider worldview than many of my peers, but can also make me feel like an outsider at times. 
Settling into my current school was made more difficult by the fact that my parents are strict about controlling social media and other aspects of my life. While I appreciate their care and concern for my wellbeing, the lack of independence and freedom causes me loneliness and frustration. My hope is that demonstrating responsibility and maturity will help build their **trust in allowing more unsupervised activities for personal expression and social connection.**

### Finding My Identity  
Figuring out who I am and what I believe has been a journey of self-discovery. Growing up between two religions from different sides of my family brings interesting questions about spirituality and faith. My queer identity also set me apart for a time. Thankfully, I have found comfort and community through open-minded friends. 
Despite struggles with **mental health issues like depression and self-harm**, music has been an anchoring force. Writing and composing original songs is how I process emotions and find purpose. Performing online is a dream, but restrictions at home have slowed that creative outlet. By continuing therapy and focusing on wellness, I hope the future brings more stability and chances to share my music. 
### Personal Growth and Progress  
Learning and growing takes effort, and making positive changes requires facing uncomfortable truths. In middle school, temptation arose to experiment with substances like vaping, but I chose a wiser path, proud to care for my health and avoid harmful addictions. Staying focused on school through multiple moves was challenging yet rewarding as grades and honors reflect diligent work.
Living an example of [abstaining from underage substance use](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/adkinson) while achieving academic success gives hope that others may choose similarly positive routes. Small steps lead to big differences - by making good daily decisions, opening up in therapy, finding alternatives to self-harm, and expressing myself through art, steady progress moves me closer to being the caring, confident person I aim to become. 
### Looking Ahead with Optimism  
At just fourteen, the road ahead remains long. With open communication and demonstrating responsibility, perhaps greater independence and trust from parents will come in time. Entering high school brings new risks but also new chances to build community through shared interests like music. Most importantly, choosing hope means recognizing that even in difficult seasons, each day offers opportunities for growth, connection, and turning points toward a brighter future. 
By making healthy choices, following passions, and focusing outward to support others, my hope is that each step brings more joy, purpose and a chance to positively influence the lives of peers. With continued effort in **therapy, wellness practices, and pursuing creative dreams,** each new chapter holds potential for richer experiences that nurture mind, body and spirit into a fulfilling adulthood. The adventures have only just begun.
