### My History of Drug Use
I had a long history of intravenous drug use which led to severe scarring of my veins, making it nearly impossible for nurses and doctors to insert an intravenous (IV) line or draw blood from my arms. For years, the only viable vein I had left was in my neck, though medical professionals were hesitant to use it. Out of desperation during drug withdrawals, I would sometimes resort to using the neck vein to inject myself if I couldn't find another.

### A Close Call with Methamphetamine 
One time, after using methamphetamine, I became extremely dehydrated and my kidneys shut down. I was taken to the emergency room where over ten nurses unsuccessfully tried for half an hour to insert an IV into my scarred arms to administer fluids. A young doctor then asked if there was anywhere they usually could draw blood. Remembering my neck vein was still usable, I suggested it, and without warning, the doctor inserted the IV there. Within moments I was receiving life-saving fluids through a neck IV.
### An Unconventional but Life-Saving Treatment
Though uncommon, placement of an IV directly in the neck can be a last resort when other veins are not accessible. The neck contains the [superior vena cava](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-with-santa-hat-cute-christmas-hat-chihuahua5563-t-shirt), one of the body's largest veins able to handle high volumes of fluid or medications. Though risky if not done properly, it proved critical to rehydrating my dehydrated body during drug withdrawal and kidney failure. I remained with a neck IV for the next 3-4 days until my condition stabilized.
### The Difficult Road to Recovery  
My hospitalization was a wake-up call prompting me to finally seek substance abuse treatment. However, overcoming years of drug addiction was an immense challenge. Through counseling and attending support group meetings, I slowly gained sobriety one day at a time. Relapse was a constant struggle, with medical crisis sometimes needed to jolt me back toward recovery. But I was determined to reclaim my life and put the desperate days of intravenous drug use behind me.
### Finding Purpose through Service 
After a year of sobriety, I wanted to help others struggling as I once did. I began volunteering at a local treatment center, sharing my story of survival and hope with new patients. Witnessing their progress gave me purpose and motivation to stay clean. Several are now sober friends who turn to me for guidance. I also advocate for improved addiction services and healthcare access. Telling my story publicly helps fight stigma while honoring those whose medical care saved my life during dark times.
### A Future Filled with Promise  
Nearly a decade has passed since those bleak days of damaging my veins with drugs. My health has rebounded, and I remain substance-free. Though scars remain, both internal and external, each sober day is a victory. I have a fulfilling career helping others and a loving family who support my recovery. My past shaped but does not define me. Going forward, I aim to make the most of each chance at life, seeking ways to offer hope, empower change and spread compassion. My journey is proof that recovery can happen through determination and community.
