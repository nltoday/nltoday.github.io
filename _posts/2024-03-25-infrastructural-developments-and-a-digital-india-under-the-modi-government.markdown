### Envisioning Projects Completion in Record Time 
I recently had a conversation with my uncle who works in the Public Works Department (PWD) of Assam. He mentioned about a new infrastructural project that was set to start in the state. Unfortunately, I do not clearly remember the details of the project. However, I expressed skepticism about the government's claim of completing the project within just two years given India's track record of mega infrastructural delays. 
To support my view, I brought up the example of the [Bogibeel Bridge Project](https://store.fi.io.vn/toy-poodle-dog-lover-heart-shape-toy-poodle-valentines-day) over the mighty Brahmaputra River in Assam. Announced way back in 2002, the bridge was still not completed even by the end of 2016, taking almost 14 long years for construction against the initial timeline. However, my uncle provided some interesting insights into the rampant corruption prevalent in infrastructural development under previous regimes.

### Rampant Corruption Leading to Project Delays
According to my uncle, it was a common practice for politicians and other stakeholders to intentionally delay project completions even after the works got over, just to amass additional unaccounted money. The modus operandi was that the **estimated cost of projects kept rising** with time due to increasing wages and material prices. So the budget sanctioned much later factored in these enhanced estimates, providing opportunity to share the surplus amount among the corrupt nexus under the table. No wonder mega projects like **Kolia Bhomora Bridge** in Assam, requiring just 135 days for completion, eventually got over only after 6 long years! 
### Institutional Reforms to Curb Corruption
My uncle further elaborated that the Modi government has put in place strong deterrents to discourage such malpractices. Now, if a project gets delayed, proportionate deductions are made from the contractor's bills based on pre-defined **liquidated damage clauses**. Additionally, an integrated end-to-end project monitoring mechanism provides real-time status, creating transparency and accountability. Contractors are also subjected to stricter performance evaluation and blacklisting in case of deviations. With such far-reaching reforms, it is no surprise that infrastructure projects are seeing unprecedented speed under the current regime. 
### A Digital India Taking Shape
During a recent train journey, I experienced first-hand how the vision of a Digital India is gradually unfolding. At the **Jaipur Railway Station**, I came across prominent signages advertising free high-speed public WiFi access points as part of RailTel's **Project Nilgiri**. Quite impressed by this digital initiative, I tried connecting and found the service seamless. Digital displays have also replaced the conventional reservation boards, displaying real-time availability of seats. These small yet significant developments are a testament to the Modi government's resolute focus on leveraging technology for empowering citizens and transforming governance.
### Expanding Rail Connectivity in Remote Regions
While increasing digitization is laudable, infrastructure remains the bedrock for economic progress, especially in a large and diverse country like India. In this context, the completion of the Bogibeel Bridge is a landmark achievement. Spanning over 4.9 kilometers across the mighty Brahmaputra, it has provided the long-awaited rail and road link between the north and south banks in upper Assam. This connectivity has opened up new vistas of development for the region by facilitating **seamless movement of passengers and freight**. It will also bolster border infrastructure and national security by easing transportation along the Indo-China frontier. 
### Ensuring Last-Mile Connectivity 
However, the true impact of such mega projects lies in how well their benefits percolate to the grassroots. While completion of infrastructure projects in record time is impressive, the focus must now shift to **ensuring last-mile connectivity**. For instance, the two districts connected by Bogibeel Bridge - Dhemaji and Dibrugarh - have several remote areas still inaccessible by rail or road network. Their integration requires developing suitable feeder routes within prescribed timelines, along with people-centric amenities and services. The upcoming years will be crucial to assess how well the government performs on these critical welfare dimensions.
### An Emerging Narrative of Development 
To conclude, there is a palpable change in infrastructure development narrative under the present regime. Megascale projects which previously languished for decades due to mismanagement and corruption are now pushed to completion at jet speeds. This is making India an attractive destination for global investments. In parallel, integrating technology across domains heralds the vision of Digital India. While these measures have set the ball rolling in a positive direction, making growth truly inclusive through universal access will be the real test. Overall, there are promising signs of an infrastructure-led development paradigm emerging for taking India to newer heights. Continued focus and timely course corrections will determine how smoothly this journey progresses.
