Aadhaar is the unique identification number issued to residents of India. It is important to keep your personal details like mobile number updated in Aadhaar for verification purposes. However, the process of updating mobile number in Aadhaar is not always straightforward. This article provides an overview of the update process based on real user experiences and offers some tips.
## The Standard Update Process 
The standard process to update your mobile number in Aadhaar is to visit an [Aadhaar enrollment center](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/agnello). You need to carry relevant documents like your Aadhaar card and a registered mobile number for verification. The center executive will verify your details and submit the update request. 
You will receive an **update request number (URN)** via SMS within 72 hours. This means your request has been accepted but is still pending final approval. It can take up to **60-90 days** to see the updated mobile number reflecting in your Aadhaar card as UIDAI follows a multi-step verification process.
### Why does it take so long?
There are several reasons why the update process takes a significant amount of time:
- UIDAI validates all updates through a demographic and **biometric authentication**. This ensures no fraudulent changes are made.
- Aadhaar has a massive database of over 1 billion residents. Updates have to go through several checks before being approved to maintain high standards of accuracy and integrity.
- Technical issues, lack of infrastructure or high application volumes can also cause delays at UIDAI's end in processing updates.

## Possible Issues and Delays 
While the standard timeline is 60-90 days, many users reported facing issues or unreasonable delays: 
- In some cases, the **enrollment center did not submit the update request properly**. This leads to the request remaining pending indefinitely.
- Technical glitches at UIDAI also cause application **cancellation or status not reflecting correctly online**. Users have to re-apply.
- Poor coordination between enrollment centers and UIDAI results in customer care providing inaccurate status updates.
- Frustration grows if updates get rejected without valid reasons after a long wait period.
- Critical services like jobs or bank accounts get affected if updates are not reflected on time.
### What can you do about delays and issues?
To resolve issues, regularly follow up by:
- Contacting enrollment center to check submission status 
- Calling UIDAI customer care for **updated status using URN**
- Filing online complaints on uidai.gov.in for unresolved cases
- Escalating to higher authorities via email if required
- Considering re-applying as a last resort if request gets cancelled
### Downloading Aadhaar without mobile number 
If you urgently need to download your Aadhaar card before the mobile number update reflects, you can generate an **Electronic Signed Copy** via uidai.gov.in using alternative contact details like email. This serves as a valid proof of identity.
## Tips to Avoid Issues 
- Choose an **enrollment agency known for efficiency** to minimize processing time  
- Carry **all required documents** to avoid rejections due to incomplete details  
- Note down URN and track status frequently via customer care
- Raise concerns proactively if timelines are exceeded without updates
- Update contact points **before they expire** to avoid re-submission
Handling updates professionally reflects UIDAI's commitment to serving residents effectively. Proper planning and follow-ups can help mitigate issues.
