## Understanding PhonePe Transactions
PhonePe is a popular digital payments platform in India that allows users to send and receive money directly from their bank accounts. Some key things to know about PhonePe transactions include:
- **By default, all transactions are saved.** This includes details like the transaction ID, amount, date, and other relevant details. 
- **Monthly statements may be sent by email.** In addition to viewing history in the app, PhonePe may periodically email users a statement summarizing their transactions.
- **Processing status can vary.** For pending transactions, the status will change from processing to success or failure once completed. Failed transactions will cancel and refund the money. 
- **No direct cancelling once processed.** You cannot cancel a transaction that has already been successfully processed through to the recipient.
With this overview of how PhonePe manages transactions, let's look at the steps to view your history for the past three years.
### Accessing Recent Transaction History 
The first step is to open the PhonePe app and log into your account with your registered phone number and password. Once logged in, look for the "Transactions" or "History" option within the main app menu. 
This will display a list of your most [recent payment transactions conducted](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-dog-lover-mom-dad-funny-gift-idea3505-t-shirt) via PhonePe. The default view typically only shows the last few months or year.

### Filtering by Custom Date Ranges
To view older transaction records, you need to adjust the date filter. Select the "Transactions" or "History" page again and look for a calendar icon or option to select dates. 
Here you can choose a custom date range like "Last 3 Years" to retrieve all your **PhonePe transactions conducted between those dates**. This pulls up a longer list covering that full multi-year period.
### Contacting Customer Support
If for some reason your older transactions do not load when filtering to the last 3 years, your best option is to reach out to PhonePe customer support. Provide them with relevant details like your registered mobile number and a description of the issue.
Representatives may be able to help **retrieve a full transaction statement directly from your account records** spanning the desired duration. They can also address any other queries regarding viewing or exporting your long-term transaction history.
## Downloading or Exporting Your Transaction History 
Once you have accessed your full transaction list within the desired 3 year date range, the next step is extracting it from the app. PhonePe offers a few options for downloading or exporting the data.
### Exporting to PDF or Excel
Look for an "Export" button typically found either in the main transactions screen or the settings menu. This lets you export the list of all displayed transactions into a shareable PDF or Excel file format.
The exported file contains all key details like date, amount, status in an organized table. This provides an easy way to **permanently save your full transaction records for record keeping purposes.**
### Requesting via Email
If the in-app export option is not available for some reason, you can alternatively request your complete statement to be sent via email from PhonePe support. 
Provide your registered details along with a request for a **statement covering transaction activity from the last 3 years**. The support agent can then email you a PDF version of your consolidated transaction report.
### Storing Offline as Backup 
It's always a good idea to not just view but also store your exported transaction file securely offline as a backup. Save multiple copies on your computer and other devices. 
This helps ensure you still have access to your full spending history even if you lose access to your PhonePe account or the app undergoes interface changes in the future.
## Interpreting Your Statement 
Once you have successfully downloaded or received your transaction statement, take some time to carefully review all the entries. 
**Filter by important metrics like amount, date, and receiver to easily analyze spending patterns over time.** You may also notice any discrepancies with refunded or failed transactions. 
Preserving electronic payment records also ensures you have supporting documentation in case of any future disputes. With the consolidated statement, you now have full **visibility into all your payment activities conducted via PhonePe in the last 36 months.**
## Maintaining Transaction Record Security
Now that you have archived your complete 3-year transaction history offline, it's important to keep this financial data private and secure. 
Use strong passwords or encryption on the file location. Avoid sharing the file publicly online. You may also **redact sensitive personal or banking details as an extra layer of protection.**
Regularly backing up transaction records but properly securing the copies ensures you can still access this important financial information even after many years have passed.
With these steps, you now have full control and visibility into reviewing your entire payment activities conducted via PhonePe for the last 3 years. Do not hesitate to contact support if you need any clarification or assistance with the process.
