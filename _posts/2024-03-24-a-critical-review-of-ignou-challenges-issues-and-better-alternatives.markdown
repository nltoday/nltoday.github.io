## Corruption and Inconsistent Evaluation
Certain IGNOU study centres have been accused of involvement in [corruption practices like demanding money in exchange for high marks in assignments](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-crazy-havanese-lady-dog-lover-v-neck-t-shirt/women&). While the exam fee is reasonable at Rs. 120, preparing well and writing the exam satisfactorily does not necessarily guarantee good marks. The author shares their personal experience of scoring just 21 marks initially in their semester exam, despite preparing well. On paying the re-evaluation fee of Rs. 750 per paper, their marks were revised up to 58 marks. They have appealed the outcome through the students' grievance process but are yet to receive a clear response. This implies **issues with transparency and consistency in IGNOU's evaluation systems**.
### Frustration with Delayed Study Materials 
For their Masters in Political Science course joined in 2018, the author did not receive the study books even after 5 months, in January 2019. They had to run between the regional centre, head office, post office and study centre—missing out on 4 days of work and 20% salary—with no one taking responsibility to resolve the issue. As a working professional relying on open and distance mode of study, **delayed study materials severely hampered their learning progress.**

## Lack of Support and Focus on Quality Education
IGNOU seems to prioritize **student quantity over quality education and support**. The university does not make adequate efforts to address student issues and improve learning experiences. As the sole authorised body overseeing all operations, IGNOU should take responsibility instead of passing the buck between different offices and centres. 
### Dismal Learning Outcomes for Students 
With minimal guidance and poor coordination, it is difficult for independent learners to stay motivated and achieve good results. The author implies their effort and prepration did not match the dismally low marks initially awarded, reflecting **issues with IGNOU's learning assessment systems**.
## Better Alternatives for Open Study Programs
In conclusion, the author strongly advises **against choosing IGNOU** given their unsatisfactory experience with various aspects like delayed services, inconclusive grievance redressal, evaluation inconsistencies and lack of coordination negatively impacting learning quality. 
### Superior Standards at Other Universities
Jamia Milia Islamia and AMU are suggested to be better options for open and distance education, with **higher academic and administrative standards compared to IGNOU**. Their regional structures may ensure timelier delivery of study materials and personalized learner support.
## In Summary
While IGNOU aims to promote inclusive education, various structural and process flaws pointed out based on real experiences indicate the need for **significant reforms in governance, operations and quality assurance** to better serve the needs of independent learners. Other open universities are able to achieve this to some extent and hence are preferable alternatives for aspiring professionals relying on flexible learning models.
