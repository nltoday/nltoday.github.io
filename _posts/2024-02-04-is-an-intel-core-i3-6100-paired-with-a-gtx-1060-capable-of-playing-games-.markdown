Most modern games can run smoothly on modest hardware combinations like an Intel Core i3 6100 paired with an Nvidia GTX 1060 graphics card. Here is a deeper look at the performance you can expect from this affordable mid-range setup.
## Maximizing performance on a budget
When building a gaming PC on a tight budget, [allocating more funds towards the graphics card](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/alcocer) is generally a smarter choice than spending heavily on the processor. An inexpensive quad-core i3 CPU like the 6100 provides enough grunt to feed most current **GPU-bound titles without major bottlenecks**. This allows more money to be invested in a capable GTX 1060, maximizing frame rates within a limited budget.
### GTX 1060 muscle powers through 1080p gaming 
Boasting powerful **Pascal architecture** and 6GB of onboard VRAM, the GTX 1060 is capable of handling most recent AAA titles at high-max settings in **1080p resolution** with ease. Games like Overwatch, Battlefield 1 and Rocket League will run at **ultra-smooth frame rates exceeding 60fps**. Even demanding open-world games like The Witcher 3, Assassin's Creed Origins and Ghost Recon Wildlands are perfectly playable at high-very high settings.

## Core i3 6100 keeps pace with lesser-thread games
While quad-core CPUs are becoming the minimum requirement, many lighter esports and older titles still only leverage one or two processor threads. In these CPU-lighter scenarios, the **i3 6100 with its strong per-core performance** is able to maintain high framerates without bottlenecking the GTX 1060. Games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Overwatch and Fortnite run without issue on the nimble dual-core/quad-thread 6100.
### Multithreaded games still run well 
Heavier multithreaded games that utilize four or more CPU threads, such as Battlefield 1, Assassin's Creed Origins and Far Cry 5, are also perfectly playable on the i3/GTX 1060 pairing. While an overclocked quad-core i5 or 6-core Ryzen might gain a few extra frames in these titles, the i3 keeps pace enough that its owners won't feel at a disadvantage versus pricier silicon.
## 14 game benchmark analysis
The video "i3 6100 paired with a GTX 1060 - Is it playable? - 14 Games Tested" provides empirical proof that this pairing can indeed handle modern games very competently. From DOTA 2 to Total War: Warhammer, framerates averaged well over 60fps on high-max graphics presets across a variety of genres. Heavier titles like Battlefield 1, ARK and Ghost Recon Wildlands still maintained perfectly smooth 40-50fps averages.
## Continued viability into the future  
While games will inevitably become more multithreaded over time, mid-range i3/GTX 1060 systems should remain relevant for 1080p gaming for several years yet. Periodic medium-level GPU upgrades can extend this setup's usable lifespan even longer. With committed development, even the most demanding upcoming releases may prove playable at lower graphics presets on this budget-focused rig.
## Alternative options for higher performance 
For those seeking higher framerates of 90-120fps for competitive play or swooning graphical quality settings, a modest CPU upgrade to an overclockable i5 or Ryzen 5 paired with a GTX 1070 represents an attainable next step. But for smooth 60+fps gaming on a tight budget in the coming years, an i3 6100 and GTX 1060 will fulfill the bills for the vast majority of players just fine.
