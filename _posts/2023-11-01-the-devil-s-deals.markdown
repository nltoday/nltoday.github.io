Sophie had always been intrigued by the supernatural tales of demons and devils striking deals with humans throughout history. Though she never believed such fantastical encounters actually occurred, the fanciful stories provided childhood entertainment. 
Decades passed as Sophie focused on building a successful career and family, leaving her former mystical interests behind. However, encountering strange happenings in her daily life now left her questioning what was truly possible. 
### A Potholed Past
Glancing down at the shredded rubber clinging to her wheel well, Sophie sighed in frustration over [yet another tire](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/addy) ruined by the city's crumbling infrastructure. No shortage of **potholes plagued** the streets as budgets for road repairs fell victim to other spending priorities. 
While idly kicking at the exposed steel belts, her eyes happened upon a flash of copper glinting in the puddle drained from her flat. Reaching down to retrieve the small object revealed an aged coin unlike any currency presently used. Turning it over in her hand revealed odd markings that seemed to shift and swirl before her eyes.

### An Ancient Coin
Upon cleaning and examining the coin under brighter lights, Sophie could discern the profile of a horned figure along with inscriptions in an unrecognizable dialect. Consulting her books yielded no clues to its origin or meaning. 
Perplexed by the discovery of such an **out-of-place artifact**, she began researching historical accounts of demonic pacts and summoning rituals performed with innocuous-seeming tokens. Could her find be connected to those fantastical tales from her youth in some unbelievable way?
### Reaching Out for Answers 
Late one night while pacing her home office, overwhelmed by questions and possibilities, Sophie impulsively decided to conduct an experiment. Followinginstructions gleaned from obscure grimoires, she drew careful symbols on the floor and placed sacrificial offerings as directed. 
Chanting unintelligible phrases by firelight, she felt foolish but continued out of desperate curiosity. When the flames flickered and windows rattled in response, disbelief and dread washed over her as invisible **malevolent presences** seemed to fill the room. 
Had she somehow managed to breach a doorway to the netherworld despite her scientific mind? And if so, what forces had she foolishly invited into her life seeking answers?
### Dealing with the Devil
As the strange phenomena continued haunting her waking hours and dreams, Sophie began to accept some unknown entity now stalked her home and thoughts. Messages scrawled in steaming mirrors and voices whispering in shadowy corners unnerved her.
Seeking to confront the presence directly, she prepared another ritual space to demand answers. This time when the summons was answered, an inhuman visage coalesced from the flickering light and spoke in a tone akin to grinding stones. 
"You have intrigued me, mortal, with your audacity. I may be willing to reveal what you desire in exchange for a binding pact. But know that **nothing comes freely** when bargaining with my kind. The penalties for breaking our deal would be...severe."
### The Price of Knowledge  
Sophie hesitated, recalling ancient warnings against **bartering one's soul**. Yet her thirst for the supernatural truths driving her to the brink of madness seemed a higher price than any fate the demon might demand. Despite tangible fear screaming against it, she agreed to the terms.
Smoke poured from the entity's form as it recounted lost histories, unveiled cryptic meanings, and corroborated her wildest suspicions with impossible proofs. At last, all her questions were answered yet dread still gripped her tightly. What cost would fulfilling this bargain require to sate such an infernal creditor? 
Only time would reveal the true nature of the demon's due and whether her desperate bid for revelation was a bargain worth keeping...or one doomed to destroy her.
