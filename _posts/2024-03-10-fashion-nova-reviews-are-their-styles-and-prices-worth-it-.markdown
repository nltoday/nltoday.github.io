### Subjective Value Judgments   
Whether any retailer provides value necessarily involves subjective appraisals. Personal criteria like fit preferences, ethics, budget and intended use all factor in. While fast fashion raises issues for some, others appreciate constantly updated selection at low cost. Local manufacturing benefits the environmentally-conscious. Overall fit, flattery and frequent wears maximize cost per use. At its best, Fashion Nova offers trend-driven looks across body types for those whose priorities it suits. Individual needs ultimately determine perceived worth.
