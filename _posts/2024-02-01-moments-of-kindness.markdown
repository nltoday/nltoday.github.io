### Getting Well Again  
When I fell ill with a high fever before Diwali holidays, I was unable to tell my mother about my condition as I did not want her to worry and rush to see me in my apartment located 800 km away. Living alone with a friend, I relied on our elderly maid who had been with us for years to help take care of me. At 75 years old, she was kinder and more caring than most.  
On the fourth day of my fever not improving, she came with spices like black pepper that she believed would [remove any negative influences or curse](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/abt). Though I did not believe in such things, I appreciated her concern for my wellbeing, which reminded me of my mother's care. The next day, seeing I was still weak, she brought a black thread from the temple, saying it would **ward off any evil effects**. All her efforts to help me recover showed the humanity in small acts of kindness.

### A Surprise Visit 
My younger sister had gotten married and moved to Bangalore with her husband and in-laws. Recently, she informed us that she was seven months pregnant with her first child. Over the following weeks, I noticed my mother acting strangely - she would stare at pregnant women in our town in Sikkim and guess how they might be feeling or what cravings they had. It irritated me that she was intruding on others like that since she couldn't see her daughter. 
When I asked her about it, she expressed how much she missed being with my sister during her pregnancy. I realized the depth of her longing to be with family. As a surprise, I booked flights for us to Bangalore to visit my sister. Seeing the joy and excitement in my mother's eyes as she began packing gifts and things my sister might need touched me deeply. Her happiness at the prospect of the trip made all the efforts worthwhile.
### Little Acts of Love  
Shaving my head is something I do occasionally but when my three year old son saw me without hair, he found it quite amusing. Thinking my hair would just come back, he tried having me bang my head or drive toy cars over it. Though my hair did not magically reappear, his innocent belief and attempts to "fix" it with toys made me smile at his love and care, however misguided. 
My sons bring me much joy and laughter through their creative ideas and perspectives on the world. Even in small moments of play, I see how much love and compassion they have to offer. It is the little everyday acts of kindness, especially from one's own family, that truly matter and make life meaningful.
### Showing Gratitude
Upon hearing about the care and concern shown by our elderly maid during my illness, my mother decided to get her a gift. She went to the market and bought the maid a new sari along with other things, asking me to give it to her on her behalf. It was touching to see my mother appreciate the kind woman who had helped look after me in her absence by showing gratitude. 
Blessed to have these loving people in my life, from family to those who work with us, their care and compassion will always be remembered. Even the smallest gestures can mean so much when done with sincerity and for the wellbeing of others.
