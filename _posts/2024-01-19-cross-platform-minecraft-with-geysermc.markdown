### A Tough Choice Between Java and Bedrock Editions 
As an avid Minecraft player who enjoys modding, it can be difficult to choose between the Java and Bedrock editions. Both editions have their pros and cons when it comes to vanilla gameplay and mod support. The Java edition provides more developed mods and easier mod installation through launchers like Curseforge. However, the Bedrock community is significantly larger and people spend more time finding exploits and glitches to enhance the vanilla experience. 
While the Java edition offers practically limitless modding potential through diverse modpacks, the constant stream of new mod releases can make it challenging to avoid getting burnt out. Additionally, the vanilla Java community seems less engaged compared to Bedrock. So for classic Minecraft without mods, Bedrock is often more enjoyable due to its energetic community. Ultimately, the extensive mod support of Java makes it the preferred choice for committed modders and technical players.

### Enabling Cross-Platform Play Through GeyserMC

Luckily, there is a solution that allows both Java and Bedrock players to join each other through GeyserMC. GeyserMC acts as a proxy, permitting Bedrock clients to connect to Java/PC edition servers seamlessly. This bridges the gap between editions through cross-platform compatibility. 
To implement cross-play, GeyserMC must be installed on the server following the setup instructions on their website. Once configured, any friends using Bedrock Edition can connect through the proxy to your Java server without issues. Additional port forwarding may be required depending on the server host.
### Downloading and Installation

GeyserMC provides direct downloads optimized for different server platforms like Paper, Spigot, Velocity, Fabric and standalone use. The installation process varies slightly based on the edition but generally involves:
1. Downloading the latest GeyserMC package from their website
2. Stopping any existing server to avoid conflicts  
3. Extracting and placing the GeyserMC files in the correct plugin/mod folder
4. Editing the server configuration file to enable the proxy
5. Starting the server to complete the setup
Their wiki contains comprehensive setup guides for each version. Ensure any plugins or mods are also fully compatible with GeyserMC before installing.
### Additional Features With Floodgate

In addition to enabling Bedrock-Java crossplay, GeyserMC offers Floodgate - a plugin that allows Bedrock users to join Java servers without requiring a Minecraft account. Through Floodgate and GeyserMC working together, Bedrock players can be identified and authorized using their Xbox Live profiles even when the Java server runs in offline mode.
This permits realms operators or server owners to set up minigames, anarchy worlds or roleplaying servers accessible to the entire Bedrock community without premium account restrictions. Floodgate seamlessly authenticates users through their Microsoft credentials.
### Hosting With Aternos
Aternos provides a free service to host lightweight Minecraft servers including support for modded setups. To deploy a GeyserMC integrated server, simply: 
1. Create an Aternos account 
2. Click the button to spawn a new server
3. Select the desired Java jar file during initialization  
4. Install GeyserMC and Floodgate using the file manager
5. Whitelist cross-play before switching the server online
This allows hosting a functional GeyserMC server at no ongoing cost. Just keep the server active to maintain the world and allow players to join across editions freely through GeyserMC.
### In Summary
GeyserMC has opened exciting possibilities for unified multiplayer across Java and Bedrock editions. Whether modded or vanilla, committed technical players or casual cross-platform friends, GeyserMC and Floodgate provide simple solutions to connect communities and break down barriers between versions. With the right setup, everyone can come together and enjoy Minecraft however they prefer - a win for the entire fanbase.
