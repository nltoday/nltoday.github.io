## Getting Started with the Official Launcher
If you've been using a cracked or third-party launcher for Minecraft in the past, it's time to make the switch to the official launcher provided by Mojang. Doing so will allow you to access all the legitimate multiplayer servers and get the full supported experience. **The first step is cleanup - delete any files or folders associated with your old cracked launcher install.** For example, if you were using the popular TLauncher, delete the `.minecraft` and `.tlauncher` folders from your computer. This ensures a clean installation with the official launcher. 
### Download and Install
With the old files deleted, you can now visit www.minecraft.net to download the official launcher installer. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup. Once installed, log in with your Mojang account credentials. If you don't have a paid Minecraft account yet, you can purchase the game during this process.

### A Smoother Gaming Experience
Now that you have the genuine version through the official launcher, you'll be able to access all **legitimate multiplayer servers, full mod support, and regular game updates.** No more workarounds or risks associated with cracked launchers. You'll also be supporting the developers so they can continue improving and expanding this beloved game. Overall, making the switch unlocks a much **smoother, safer and supported gaming experience.**
## Multiplayer Options with Cracked vs Premium
One of the key differences between using a cracked launcher versus the official premium version is **multiplayer access and capabilities. Let's explore the options.**
### Cracked Server Play
If you're still using a cracked launcher, your multiplayer is limited to servers that specifically allow cracked players. A popular example is BlockDrop, a mini-games server network. However, most major servers like [Hypixel require a legitimate premium account](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-papillon-i-may-not-be-rich-and-famous-but-im-a-dog-mom-3) to join due to security and stability concerns with cracks.
### Aternos for Friends
A good compromise if you want to play with friends locally is to use Aternos, a free server hosting site. You can create a server and opt to allow cracked players in the settings. Then your friends on cracks can connect using the provided IP address for private fun together. Just remember the server has usage limits as a free option.
### Official Servers Need Premium
In summary, **to access the full spectrum of popular multiplayer servers, you'll need to upgrade your cracked launcher to a paid premium Minecraft account.** This unlocks official mod support too. The good news is premium accounts are affordable and help support ongoing game development.
## Other Trusted Third-Party Launchers
While the official launcher is recommended, there are also some **trusted third-party launchers you can use with a legitimate Minecraft account for added features or customization.** These include OptiFine, Lunar Client and Badlion Client. 
### OptiFine for Performance
A staple of the community is OptiFine, which provides **graphic optimizations, faster loading, and integrated shaders** to enhance the visual experience. It's 100% safe to use with any real minecraft account for boosted performance.
### Lunar for Features  
Lunar Client takes things further with mods built directly in plus special modes like Bedwars. **It focused heavily on PvP aspects with features like modifiers and aim assist.** Lunar is officially partnered with Mojang so you don't need to worry using your real account with it.
### Badlion for Mods
A similarly trusted option is Badlion Client, known best for its deep mod integration **allowing you to directly download and use hundreds of popular mods without third party launchers.** It also offers perks like custom crosshairs and mods.
## Switching Accounts Securely
If you were using login details from a cracked or stolen Minecraft account, it's important to properly secure your new legit profile during the switch.
### Unique Password
Be sure to choose a strong, unique password for your new Mojang/Minecraft account that isn't used on any other sites. Also enable two-factor authentication in your account settings for an extra layer of protection. 
### Delete Cracked Files
Just like before installing the official launcher, delete any leftover temp files or folders associated with old cracked installs. This ensures a clean break and that no private credential information could potentially be lingering. 
### Watch for Suspicious Activity
Monitor your account for any suspicious login attempts from unknown locations. Contact Mojang support immediately if you notice anything odd. With the right safety practices, you can play confidently knowing your new legit profile is fully secure.
## Welcoming You to the Official Community 
We hope this guide has helped explain the process of transitioning from a cracked launcher to the genuine experience through Mojang. You're now able to join **the large official community of players, access all features, and support ongoing development.** Welcome, and enjoy all that premium Minecraft has to offer!
