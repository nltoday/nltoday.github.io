Teachers like Satish play a vital role in shaping the lives of underserved students and helping close the socioeconomic achievement gap. Through dedication and perseverance, one can uplift not only students but also themselves and their families.
### Early Beginnings in the Restaurant Industry   
As a young boy of 15, Satish worked as a delivery boy near his hometown, earning 150 rupees per week. He enjoyed the camaraderie of his coworkers after closing time. However, one day he was caught in a child labor violation and had to stop working there. For the next two months, he passed time playing cricket with friends in his neighborhood.

Satish then found work inside a hotel, cleaning dishes and floors for 1000 rupees per month. He excelled in his studies, scoring 1148 out of 1200 on his 12th standard exams. After completing his B.Sc. in Computer Science with scholarship assistance, he gained valuable experience in retail, textiles, and data collectionâ€”often earning between 3000 to 15,000 rupees per month.

### Pursuing a Career in Technology

Though initial interviews proved discouraging, he landed a 3 lakh rupees per year entry-level **technology role** in Bangalore at age 28. Through dedication to continuous learning, he advanced his career, increasing salaries to 9 lakhs and now 23 lakhs per year. Satish is grateful for the support of teachers, friends, and employers who helped him progress.
### Giving Back Through Teaching Underserved Youth
Despite his economic success, Satish remembers his roots. He earns an additional 2000 rupees monthly teaching 40 underprivileged 12th standard students for two hours each day. Witnessing their respect and drive to improve their lives and families through education is deeply fulfilling. Through compassionate mentorship of disadvantaged youth, Satish hopes to help close the opportunity gap and empower students to achieve their potential.

By pursuing his calling to teach and his career in technology simultaneously, Satish has found purpose and life satisfaction beyond financial rewards. His story shows that with perseverance and role models who provide guidance, one can uplift oneself while uplifting others in need of a **helping hand**.
### Creating Positive Change through Small Acts 
Small, daily acts of service like Satish's teaching can make a big difference. His students clearly respect and appreciate the care, support and knowledge he provides. In turn, they are Inspired to work hard and utilize the opportunities he helps open doors to. If more people dedicate even a few hours weekly towards mentoring underprivileged youth, imagine the impact on not just individual lives but also communities and society overall.
