### Genuine Friendliness on a Motorbike Tour
While touring Vietnam by motorbike in 2012, I experienced the extraordinary kindness of locals along the route. We passed through tiny villages where everyone greeted us with big smiles. One day, we stopped at a home offering food. The woman spoke Vietnamese yet didn't understand we couldn't understand her. [She considerately let us wash our hands before serving drinks and pho](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/albee). She **sat and talked with us throughout the meal**.

### Unsurpassed Hospitality from a Village Woman  
After our meal, assuming I needed the bathroom, she fetched **toilet paper I hadnâ€™t seen in weeks**. Most Asians don't use toilet paper, so she must have **saved it for special occasions.** She led me through spiders in the outhouse yet had confidence I **wouldn't be scared of arachnids.** Afterwards, she applied sunscreen to my back while happily chatting. Noticing I **lacked protective clothing**, she offered her shoes and jacket. Both she and her husband waved until we were out of sight, showing remarkable **hospitality and friendliness.**
### Wide Smiles and Conversations in a Crowded Store  
In a tiny neighborhood store in Hanoi, I found myself one of very few foreigners. Everyone said "hello" **in unison with wide smiles**. Carefully navigating through crowds, my eyes met many who **beamed and greeted me again.** A crowd gathered when I examined packages, with people using **all English skills to help me choose products.** An elderly man **insisted on carrying my basket**, following me and **throwing items in without payment.** 
### Strangers Become Friends on an Overnight Train
On the night train from Saigon to Hue, though **we couldn't understand each other's languages**, my roommates and I **shook hands as friends.** A pregnant lady and older men, all strangers, **knew we'd remember each other** if paths crossed again. **Such warm and instant friendships** illustrate Vietnam's hospitality.
### Welcoming All with Friendliness and Acceptance  
As an African American traveling alone, I expected difficulties but found **only acceptance and kindness.** Initial wariness vanished after one interaction, making people **instantly my best friends**. From smallest towns to biggest cities, **everyone welcomed and befriended me**, no matter who I was. Vietnam's atmosphere, like traffic, moves in **harmony together.** I've since spent **extended time in this welcoming country.**
### Even Strangers Go Out of Their Way to Help Visitors
During another trip to Vietnam with my daughter, **people in Ha Noi approached us to welcome us** without needing anything. While traveling the country, **train staff cared for our every need**. On one 33-hour journey, **other passengers became friends**. Due to the warmth we experienced everywhere, **I now plan to spend a year living in Vietnam.** Truly, the Vietnamese are among the most friendly, hospitable people in the world.
