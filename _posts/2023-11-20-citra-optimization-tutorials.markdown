### Maximize Performance with these Easy Tweaks
One of the easiest ways to improve performance in Citra is to close any unnecessary programs or browser tabs that are running in the background. Every additional application takes up memory and system resources, reducing the amount available for Citra. By closing unneeded windows, you can free up RAM and processing power to increase your framerate by 5-10 FPS.

### Keep Your Device Charged
Another simple tweak that makes a huge difference is ensuring your device is plugged in while playing games. For many people, switching from battery power to a charger more than quadruples their framerate. The extra power allows your CPU and GPU to run at full throttle without thermal throttling. On my laptop specifically, framerates improve from a sluggish 15 FPS up to a buttery smooth 75-80 FPS simply by keeping it plugged in during gameplay.
### Configure Maximum Framerate in Settings
While the previous tweaks provide easy gains with little effort, to really maximize performance you need to delve into Citra's settings. One key option is changing the maximum framerate setting under **Emulation > Configure > General**. Most original 3DS games target 30 FPS, so setting this to 300% essentially allows Citra to output 3 times as many frames. On high-end PCs, this can push framerates [above 90 FPS](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/aldrete) which is not possible on real hardware. Just be aware it may not improve the look of all games since extra frames are duplicated.
### Overclock Your Processor for More Headroom  
For those comfortable overclocking their CPU, it provides a very noticeable boost to framerates in Citra. Most desktop processors have additional overclocking headroom beyond their stock speeds. For example, overclocking my AMD A8-7650K from its default 3.2GHz to 3.9GHz significantly reduced lag and stutters during intensive scenes. Just be sure to monitor temperatures closely using tools like HWInfo and have proper cooling like a large air tower heatsink.
### Update Everything for Enhanced Performance
In addition to tweaking Citra settings, it's wise to keep your overall system up to date. Fully updating graphics drivers, your operating system, and any other software ensures optimal performance and compatibility. Older versions may have issues or lack optimizations for newer hardware. Spending a few minutes checking for and installing any pending updates across your device is well worth it for smoother Citra gameplay.
### Add a Discrete Graphics Card
While integrated graphics like those found on most laptops can run Citra, a dedicated budget graphics card provides a real bump. Even a basic older model like the Nvidia GT 730 I use more than doubles framerates in many games compared to the integrated Intel HD graphics. Looking for one used under $50 unlocks much better performance potential compared to struggling on inferior onboard video. Just be mindful of power supply needs.
### Follow Recommended Configuration
Making sure Citra itself is configured properly also aids optimization. Certain settings like "fast memory" and "accurate GPU emulation" carry overhead that impacts speed. Referencing recommendations for your specific hardware can steer you towards a setup that strikes the right balance of compatibility and frames per second. With some experimentation, most mid-range modern PCs should achieve full speed in many titles.
### Test Different Android Emulators 
While Citra is the leading emulator for 3DS on PC, some games may run into limitations or glitches regardless of tweaks. In those cases, it's worthwhile testing alternative Android emulators that can run 3DS-friendly mobile ports instead. Examples include Nox App Player, BlueStacks, and LDPlayer which all allow mapping controller input well. You never know, a ported version may provide a smoother experience where Citra falls short. It's worth keeping options open for optimal gameplay.
### Conclusion
With some simple tweaks and more advanced overclocking, most PCs can achieve essentially full speed 3DS emulation. But don't forget to also test alternative emulators, as mobile ports may bypass issues in rare cases. The tips covered ranging from closing other programs to updating components scratches the surface of optimization potential. Experimentation is key to finding each system's sweet spot.
