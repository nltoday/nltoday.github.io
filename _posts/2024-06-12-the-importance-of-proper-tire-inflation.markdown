### Understanding Tire Pressure Requirements
When driving on different surfaces, the required tire pressure differs. **Off-road tire pressure** needs to be lowered for better traction in soft surfaces like sand. However, when driving on paved roads, tires should be inflated to the recommended pressure printed on the sidewall. Reducing pressure too much on firm surfaces like concrete highways can lead to overheating and failures.

### Factors Leading to Tire Failures
There are three main factors that individually or combined can cause tire failures - too low or high pressure, excessive load, and high speeds. [Underinflated or overinflated tires](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-unicorn-t-shirt-girls-space-galaxy-rainbow-dog-tee3596-t-shirt) cause heat build-up inside the tire which damages the rubber over time. Carrying loads heavier than the recommended capacity or driving at very high speeds puts additional stress on the tires. However, the primary reason for most tire blowouts is excessive heat generation due to incorrect air pressure.
### Signs of Underinflation and Consequences 
Drivers should check tire pressure monthly and before long trips using a pressure gauge. Common signs of underinflation include bulging sidewalls, uneven treadwear, reduced fuel economy and handling issues. Tires that are **25% below recommended pressure** or lower are considered significantly underinflated. Driving on underinflated tires can damage tires and wheels over bumps. It also increases braking distances and affects steering response negatively. 
### Safe Driving with Extremely Low Pressure 
While regular checks and proper inflation are important, sometimes emergencies like slow leaks can happen. As a last resort in emergencies, one can drive short distances with pressures as low as 10 psi, as long as the rim is not scraping the ground. However, handling quality will be seriously compromised. Bumps and turns can damage tires at such low pressures, so it is only advisable for a few miles to the nearest air pump.
### Checking Tire Condition and Pressure Regularly
It is recommended to inspect tires monthly for conditions like uneven treadwear, cracks and bulges indicating underinflation or overloading. Use a reliable tire pressure gauge to check **run-flat tire pressure** and adjust it as needed when tires are cold. Also examine the spare tire and keep it ready. **Proper maintenance extends tire life** and plays a big role in vehicle safety. Following manufacturers' guidelines ensures tires function as intended.
### Consequences of Driving on Underinflated Tires 
Underinflated tires wear out faster due to flexing under loads. They overheat easily and are more likely to experience blowouts or tread separation failures. The soft sidewalls are damaged by potholes or uneven surfaces. Handling and braking distances are compromised, increasing accident risks. Fuel costs also rise as more energy is spent to roll the tire. Regular checks and correct inflation are simple ways to prevent these issues.
### Inflating Tires Safely
When inflating tires, **use a regulated air compressor** set to the rated pressure or a reliable pressure gauge. Stand away from the tire and inflate slowly to prevent accidents. Over-inflating can be as dangerous as under-inflating, so don't exceed the maximum printed pressure. Also inspect tire valves before inserting an air chuck - corroded valves may need replacement for safety. Proper maintenance is important for carefree driving.
# Conclusion
Keeping tires correctly inflated is one of the easiest and most effective ways to ensure safety, performance and durability. Drivers should be aware of the diverse pressure needs based on vehicle and road type. Early identification of underinflation signs through regular checks helps avoid hazardous situations. While emergencies may call for driving on extremely low pressure temporarily, correct inflation must be restored at the earliest. Adhering to manufacturers' guidelines is prudent for trouble-free motoring.
