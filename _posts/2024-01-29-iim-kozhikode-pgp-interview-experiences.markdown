## IIM Kozhikode: Call, Preparation and Interview
I received a call for the Personal Interview Round from IIM Kozhikode after scoring 99.2% in CAT 2017 with 95% in Class XII and 90.4% in Graduation. I prepared well for over two months with the help of mentors from other IIMs. 
### Pre-Interview Preparation 
I focused on revising my academics, work experience, hobbies and extracurricular activities. I also practiced **common GD/interview questions** with mentors to improve my communication and presentation skills. Reading newspapers regularly helped me stay updated on current affairs.

### Interview Experience
The interview was conducted at **Raddison Blu, Delhi** on 9th February 2018. There were two professors for the round - Professor 1 (P1) who looked serious initially but was friendly, and Professor 2 (P2) who seemed relaxed. 
### The Interview Process
I greeted the professors politely after which P1 asked me to take a seat. P1 started with questions about my graduation profile and final year project while P2 focused more on my interests and hobbies. The discussion then moved to various [other academic and current topics](https://store.fi.io.vn/west-coast-rappers-hip-hop-hood-security-fashion-rottweiler-1). 
### Answering Technical Questions
When asked to explain technical concepts, I was able to answer algorithms and their complexities clearly. However, I made a minor error in one complexity which the professors pointed out politely. Overall, both professors seemed pleased with my technical knowledge.
### Valuing Soft Skills Above Academics
Towards the end, P1 emphasized that they were more interested in my communication and personality than academics. The friendly interview went on for close to an hour with discussions ranging from career goals to hobbies like cooking and singing.
### Receiving a Positive Response

For the CAP Round, I focused more on current events by regularly reading newspapers, magazines and blogs. I also practiced sample essays on various topics to improve my writing speed and articulation of views.
### WAT Topic on Gender Equality  
The **Writing Ability Test** was based on prevalent gender issues and the #MeToo movement. I was able to clearly express well-reasoned views on the topic within the given time of 20 minutes.
