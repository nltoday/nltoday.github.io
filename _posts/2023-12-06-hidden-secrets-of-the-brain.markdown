The human brain remains one of the greatest mysteries in science. Here are some of the surprising secrets your brain hides from you on a daily basis.
## Your Brain Ignores Most Sensory Information
Your brain is constantly bombarded with sensory information from your eyes, ears, skin, and other senses. However, it cannot process and make sense of all this data. Amazingly, your brain sifts through and filters out **over 90% of sensory information** it receives! This allows it to focus only on the most important and relevant data to help you interact with the world efficiently. Some signals, like the feeling of your clothes or the sensation of breathing, are tuned out automatically as they are not critical. Your brain sees these repetitive inputs as "noise" and filters them to reduce distraction and optimize useful perception.
### Beyond Perception: Predictive Processing 
Modern neuroscience suggests the brain does more than just passively receive and filter sensory inputs. It actively generates predictions of the external world based on past experiences and learns from errors between actual sensations and anticipations. This [predictive processing theory](https://store.fi.io.vn/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) proposes the brain constantly makes inferences about what is happening right now based on memory and context. It hypothesizes perception emerges from brain circuitry aimed at minimizing unpredictability rather than passively representing stimuli. Some classical visual illusions may originate from the brain's innate predictive biases rather than defective sensation.

## Your Second Brain in the Gut
We are familiar with the brain in our skull, but we have a second one located in our intestines containing as many neurons as the spinal cord - the **enteric nervous system**! It works independently to control digestive functions without instructions from the central brain. The gut sends signals to the brain as well, andMounting evidence suggests a **bidirectional gut-brain axis** greatly impacts both physical and mental health through neural, endocrine and immune pathways. The microbes in our intestines may influence brain development, metabolism, behavior and even moods via neurochemical messengers. An imbalanced gut microbiome is implicated in various neurological and psychiatric conditions. Nurturing a healthy gut could boost brain health.
### Changes in Microbiome May Alter Behavior 
Certain parasites like Toxoplasma gondii are masters of mind control. They have been found to manipulate the behavior of their hosts in ways that enhance transmission probabilities. For example, infected rodents lose their innate fear of cats and become attract to their smell - the definitive host of the parasite. While humans are not direct hosts of T. gondii, infection is linked to changes in personality traits like rule-breaking in men. Intriguingly, the human gastrointestinal tract contains trillions of bacteria that could influence neural activity and behavior through metabolic byproducts like short-chain fatty acids. Ongoing research explores how shifts in intestinal microbiota composition may underlie neurodevelopmental and mental disorders. 
## Your Memory is Anything but Perfect
Contrary to common belief, our memory does not function like a video recorder that stores verbatim records of past experiences. It is a reconstructive process that is fallible and subjective. Memories change each time they are recalled due to the interaction of multiple internal and external factors. 
### Memory is Dynamic and Malleable
Research shows memory is **not a static documentation** of reality, but rather an adaptive process that is dynamic and malleable. It can be affected by emotions, motivations, beliefs and social influences. Studies find simply imagining an event that never occurred may result in false memories being formed over time through the process of memory reconsolidation. The act of remembering distorts memory traces to integrate them with newly learned knowledge and ideas. While it provides cognitive flexibility crucial for abstract thoughts, this reconstructive nature also makes long-term memory vulnerable to errors and bias.
### Memory Recall is a Creative Act 
When attempting to retrieve memories, the brain engages in a **creative, generative process** of reconstructing past experiences based on available cues. Many factors like context, intervening new learning and social conversation contribute to how memories are eventually reconstructed during their retrieval. This causes memory to change qualitatively over time rather than remaining stable. Mnemonic accuracy depends more on how well we can attribute a memory to its original context than how well details are preserved. Remembering, at its core, is an inventive/imaginative endeavor rather than a perfect replay of storage.
## Your Visual System Prefers Predictions Over Perceptions
It is well known our eyes can only process visual input with significant delays, yet we perceive the world as smoothly continuous in space and time. Modern theories propose how the brain resolves this paradox - it does not passively experience perceptions, but actively constructs subjective versions of reality through predictive inferences.
### Perception Arises from Prediction 
The brain is too slow to witness 'the present' given neural conduction and processing lags. But it has devised clever solutions to overcome its own imperfections. Studies found **visual predictions** generated in the cerebral cortex can compensate for neural delays, resulting in conscious experiences that seem instantaneous and seamlessly 'in the moment'. Phenomena like the flash-lag illusion demonstrate visual perception aligns more with the brain's anticipation rather than physical stimuli - we perceive what is predicted rather than purely seen.
### Predictions Enhance Perception
Making educated guesses about missing sensory information allows for a coherent, optimized representation of the world despite inherent neural limitations. Predictive coding theory posits **perception optimizes probability estimates** by minimizing errors between feedforward signals and top-down expectations. This predictive process is thought to enhance perception by filling in gaps, smoothing transitions and clarifying ambiguities based on past learning. It suggests the function of cortical areas like the primary visual cortex may be generating anticipations rather than directly representing retinal images.
## Your Cortex is in Constant Competition 
The human brain remains incredibly adaptable throughout life through neuroplasticity, or its ability to change wiring and forge new connections based on experiences. This allows it to retain juvenile malleability needed for rapid learning even into adulthood. However, plasticity is not unlimited - the brain must strike a balance between stability and flexibility.
### Neuroplasticity through Competition
At the cellular level, neural circuits engage in a **competitive "use it or lose it"** dynamic for scarce resources. Regions that receive more inputs will strengthen synaptic connections at the expense of less active areas. This competitive model of learning, known as **neural Darwinism**, ensures the cortex devotes relatively more space to representations that are regularly stimulated versus those less frequently used. It underlies experience-dependent brain development as well as the brain's ability to reorganize and recover functions even after significant injuries. 
### Rewiring through Repurposing
Studies found in blind individuals, parts of theoccipital cortex that normally process vision spontaneously reorganize to support skills like Braille reading and spatial cognition through cross-modal plasticity. In deaf people, their auditory cortices were activated by sights and touch sensation. This demonstrates how sensory cortices left unused can be **repurposed** over time - a process reflecting neural circuits competing for control over phantom neural real estate. Such remapping of cortical functional territories maximizes overall brain efficiency and compensates for disability.
## Your Memory is Replayed during Sleep 
Sleep serves critical functions beyond just rest, one of which is to cement new learning and memories. This is supported by reactivating memory traces formed that day while awake through "replay" during specific sleep stages.   
### Memory Consolidation through Replay
During deep non-REM sleep, the same neuronal sequences activated initially during tasks are **re-encoded** within the hippocampus and neocortex. It is thought visualizing past experiences through replay helps transfer memories from temporary hippocampal storage to more permanent neocortical reserves, making them resilient to amnesic damage. Studies pairing odors to reward during mice's daytime found such associative memories were reactivated and strengthened during subsequent sleep. Blocking hippocampus replay impaired later recall of those experiences and relationships.
### False Memory Implantation through Artificial Replay
A creative application of the replay phenomenon saw researchers directly stimulate reward and spatial circuits in sleeping mice to induce made-up "memories" of visiting non-existent locations for treats. This led mice to believe fictional events truly occurred and behave accordingly when awake. Such work illustrates sleep's memory consolidation role extends beyond natural experience - it can incorporate artificially generated episodes that never took place, confirming systems consolidating true happenings during sleep are similar to those integrating fantastical ones. 
In conclusion, the human brain remains full of hidden mysteries, from its prediction-based nature that shapes cognition, to its competitive adaptations and sleep-based memory magic. Appreciating our minds' deceptive simplicity and surprising complexity alike fosters a deeper understanding and wisdom. While the answers uncovered inspire more questions, studying the brain's intricate inner workings continues advancing science and bettering lives.
