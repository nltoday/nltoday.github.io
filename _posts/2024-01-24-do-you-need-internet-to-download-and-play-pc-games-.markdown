### Validating Game Codes
To validate a game code purchased either physically or digitally, an internet connection is required to connect the code to your Steam account. Steam is the leading digital distribution platform for PC games, requiring users to create an account. When entering a code, your computer will need to contact Steam's authentication servers to verify the code is valid and register the game to your account. Without an internet connection, Steam has no way to check the code's authenticity.
Many major PC game publishers now utilise digital distribution platforms like Steam, Epic Games Store, Origin and others. These services allow people to redeem codes, download games and additional game content. To take full advantage of these features an internet connection is a necessity. Offline mode is sometimes supported, but authentication of codes and initial game downloads always require being online.

### Downloading PC Games Digitally 
Once a game code is validated, the next step is downloading the actual game files from the digital storefront. For initial downloads and game updates [this almost always needs to be done while connected to the internet](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/chihuahua-lover). The game files can be large, sometimes tens of gigabytes in size for triple-A titles. Without a fast, stable internet connection the download process would not function reliably. 
Digital storefronts host all game files on their own centralized servers. To obtain these files, your PC has to be able to communicate and transfer data back and forth from the servers. Offline mode in services like Steam let you launch some previously downloaded games without internet, but new downloads are simply not possible without first connecting online.
### Downloading Game Patches and Updates
After the initial download is complete, a fast internet connection remains important for keeping PC games up to date. Nearly all games receive regular patches and updates post-launch to fix bugs, add/improve features and gameplay balance changes. 
Keeping games updated is important for several reasons. Patches address bugs or exploits that could otherwise negatively impact the gaming experience. They may also be required to access multiplayer modes or dedicated servers. Falling too far behind on updates can cause compatibility issues joining online games with friends. A continuous internet connection helps ensure games stay updated hassle-free.
### Internet Requirements for Physical Game Discs  
Unlike in past generations, inserting a physical PC game disc today often just provides a jump start to the download process rather than the full install. Many disc copies utilize only part of their storage for game files, relying on internet downloads to obtain the rest. 
The disc acts as a sort of authentication rather than a pure installation medium. An internet connection is still required to pull down any missing data after inserting the disc. Some games even require online authentication checks just to launch at all, whether installed physically or digitally. This allows publishers tighter control over used game sales and rentals.
### Playing Games Online Requires a Steady Connection
Beyond just downloading content, continued internet access provides the foundation for enjoying many online PC gaming features. Leaderboards, multiplayer modes, co-op campaigns, and more utilize constant network connectivity between players. 
Losing connection mid-game can disrupt these experiences, booting people from servers or hindering progress with friends. **A reliable broadband internet service becomes essential for maximizing potential PC gaming has to offer in online spheres**. Even single-player titles often contain some forms of cloud saving or online components as well.
### Internet Speed Recommendations for Gaming  
The quality of a person's internet connection comes down to both speed and reliability. For smooth digital downloads and basic online gameplay, speeds of 10-15 Mbps down are usually sufficient. However, to get the most from high-fidelity current games, faster speeds are preferable when possible.
**For downloads, aim for 25 Mbps down or higher if available** to allow large games to install in a reasonable timeframe. During active online multiplayer, stable speeds of 25 Mbps down or greater help prevent lag or disconnections from impacting performance. **Ultra-fast fiber connections exceeding 50 Mbps support virtually lag-free gaming**, regardless of bandwidth-intensive online features or number of devices simultaneously streaming/browsing.
Overall, simply put, a persistent internet connection is mandatory for all PC gaming in the modern era. Whether interacting online or offline, users must connect to authentication servers or download game data and updates. Internet access underpins how PC games are designed, developed and delivered across platforms today.
