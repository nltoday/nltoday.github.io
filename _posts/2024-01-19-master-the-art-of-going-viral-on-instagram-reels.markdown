### Track Analytics and Engage with Feedback
Monitor metrics like average watch time, save rates and comments to understand audience preferences. Engage genuinely with any feedback by responding promptly and adjusting future reels based on what viewers connect with most. This two-way conversation helps you create the type of relatable, valuable content that spreads organically. Tracking analytics also reveals the hashtags and timings that maximize your reach.

While originality is good, piggybacking off trending topics and sounds increases discoverability. Joining viral **dance challenges** or using popular background music incorporates your reel into search results. This exposure could lead curious browsers to stumble upon your content and boost viral potential.
### Capitalize on Current Trends 
Check the Instagram "Trending" tab or global social media for the latest dances, jokes or transitions gaining traction. Quickly producing a creative take on trends before they fade keeps your reels feeling fresh and entertaining. Ride momentum while also adding your unique spin. 
### Source from Other Platforms
TikTok often births new challenges and sounds that spread across Instagram. Staying plugged into videos blowing up elsewhere points you toward content styles resonating broadly. Adapt these themes to your platform with on-brand flair.
## Collaborate and Engage with Other Creators
Partnering is a strategic way to introduce your reels and personality to new potential fans. Reach out to similar size creators in your niche with proposals for collaborative content.
### Film Joint Reels, Mentions and Shoutouts  
Film a dual-perspective challenge, Q&A or prank that leverages both of your followings. Promote each other authentically with mentions in captions and comments. Return any support by shouting out reciprocal collaborators to audiences already familiar with their content. This cross-pollination expands your reach organically.
### Comment and Engage on Others' Reels
Watch and leave genuine replies on reels from accounts in related niches or of comparable size. Forming positive relationships often leads to mutual boosts through likes, shares and comments that algorithmically pair your profiles. Staying interactive cultivates new potential collaborative partners too.
## Share Strategically Across Multiple Platforms
Reaching broader audiences increases the chances of a reel spreading virally. Share content to complementary platforms with large user bases such as TikTok, YouTube or Twitter.
### Choose Platforms that Align with Your Content  
Evaluate where your target demographic spends most time online. For example, lifestyle and beauty creators would benefit from YouTube due to its longer watch times optimal for demonstrations. While comedic or dance reels may gain more traction on TikTok’s For You feed.
### Use Platform-Optimized Titles, Descriptions and Hashtags
Alter video details subtly based on each site’s unique preferences. For instance, TikTok favors trending audio hashtags while YouTube prioritizes relevant keywords and lengthy descriptions. Tailor your approach without compromising authenticity. 
### Link Back to Your Instagram Profile
Include featured links and watermarks back to your Instagram when sharing reels elsewhere. This directs any new fans fast to see more of your content and follow you - boosting engagement over the long run.
In conclusion, developing strong video skills, piggybacking trends, cultivating relationships with other creators and strategically distributing across multiple platforms are all valuable tactics for increasing exposure and taking your Instagram Reels viral. With consistency, quality content and audience engagement, your creative reels have strong potential for organic growth.
