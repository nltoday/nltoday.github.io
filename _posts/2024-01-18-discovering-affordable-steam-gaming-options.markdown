### Evaluating Key Game Resellers
Fanatical is one of the few legitimate Steam game key resellers. [While they occasionally offer good deals](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-dad-daddy-owner-of-a-chihuahua-chihuahua-lover3736-t-shirt), buyers need to be wary of non-discounted bundled games included to inflate profits. CDKeys appears legally sourced but lacks transparency in suppliers. Riskier stores like Gamivo and G2A resemble second-hand marketplaces with little oversight on key origins.
