### Origins and Extent of Use in Final Fight Against Kaguya
Naruto began his final fight possessing **Nine Truth-Seeking Orbs**, a celestial tool of immense power bestowed upon him by Hagoromo Otsutsuki. He had [two in his hands](https://yt.io.vn/collection/abrahams) and **seven behind his back**. Against Kaguya, he **expended three orbs**, leaving him with only **six remaining** for his battle with Sasuke.

### Further Depletion Against Sasuke and Unexplained Disappearance  
When facing off against Sasuke, Naruto was noted to have only **three orbs left over**, indicating he had used up **an additional three orbs** in his struggle with Kaguya. Curiously, by the conclusion of his fight with Sasuke, he appeared to have **no orbs in his possession whatsoever**. This begs the question of what became of that **final remaining orb**.
### Possible Explanations and Theories for Naruto's Lack of Orb Usage Post-War
There are a few potential explanations for Naruto seemingly no longer having access to even one remaining Truth-Seeking Orb going forward. Perhaps the immense power drain from six paths Sage Mode renders further orb utilization impossible. It's also plausible the orbs were permanently depleted or absorbed in his final clash with Sasuke. Alternatively, the authors may have opted not to continue emphasizing Naruto's orb ability for the sake of balancing power scaling in the new generation.
### Applications Against opponents Like Momoshiki but Conspicuous Absence 
Naruto's Truth-Seeking Orbs granted abilities like manipulation of all five nature transformations and defense against most any jutsu. This would position them as ideal weapons against opponents like Momoshiki, who could absorb ninjutsu. Curiously, though, Naruto did **not deploy even a single orb** in his battle with Momoshiki, relying solely on taijutsu and Sage Mode. **The orbs' absence here remains unexplained**.
### Utility Versus Foes Like Delta but Strategic Omission 
Against Delta and her energy absorption, the Truth-Seeking Orb's **pure chakra form** may have proven **highly effective while avoiding absorption**. Yet Naruto opted **not to employ his storied orbs**, instead fighting Delta hand-to-hand. **Was this a narrative choice or strategic on Naruto's part?** The exclusion of his celestially bestowed power leaves readers grasping for answers.  
### Legacy of Plot Holes and Unresolved Inconsistencies Regarding Orb whereabouts
In the end, the curious case of Naruto's missing and underutilized Truth-Seeking Orbs persists as one of the most glaring plot holes in Naruto's transition to Boruto. **Fans still debate online why he seemingly destroyed or lost access to such a pivotal ability**. Unless directly addressed, this conspicuous absence of his cosmic power source risks hurting the story's internal logic and consistency going forward.
