### Installing Linux On Chromebook
In order to play Minecraft on a Chromebook, the only viable option is to install Linux on the device. Chromebooks run Chrome OS which is based on Linux kernel but isn't suitable for gaming. By enabling developer mode and installing a Linux distro alongside Chrome OS using Crouton, you can run Minecraft on Chromebook. 
Crouton allows installing Ubuntu or any other compatible Linux distribution on Chromebook to use alongside Chrome OS. Once Crouton is installed, you need to install OpenJDK or Oracle Java runtime. Minecraft being a Java game requires Java to run. Installing Java may require adding additional repositories for Linux distro used.

### Configuring Hardware Acceleration
Chromebooks often have weak hardware for gaming. It's important to enable graphics hardware acceleration for good gaming performance. Most Intel Chromebooks support hardware acceleration out of the box. For ARM Chromebooks, VGA switcheroo toolkit needs to be installed to switch virtual graphics with actual GPU. This allows utilizing the integrated graphics hardware for better performance.
### Downloading And Running Minecraft
After Java installation, you can download the classic [Minecraft desktop version](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-working-out-funny-chihuahua-fitness-gym-installing-muscles-illustrations5187-t-shirt) from Minecraft.net. The .jar file needs to be run using the java command specifying game launcher class. Some tweaking may be needed for optimal performance like allocating more RAM to the game. Running Minecraft from Linux requires some technical know-how but is possible on Chromebooks.
### Using Android Version Via ARChon
An alternative is to use **Minecraft: Pocket Edition** available on Android via ARChon runtime. This allows runningAndroid apps on Chrome OS. However, ARChon is still in early stages with limited app compatibility. The mobile Minecraft version may have performance issues compared to desktop one. This method becomes more viable as ARChon develops.
### Streaming via Remote Desktop
For less technical users, setting up a remote desktop to stream Minecraft running on another desktop PC is an option. Services like Steam Link, Rainway allow low latency game streaming over the local network. Chromebooks support many remote desktop clients too. Though additional hardware is required, it allows playing Minecraft on Chromebook remotely with minimal configuration.
### Final Thoughts
While not ideal, it is possible to play Minecraft on Chromebooks with some tinkering. For a simple plug and play experience, a Chromebook may not be the best choice. But for technical users, utilizing Linux and workarounds can provide a playable Minecraft experience on a low-cost Chromebook. Compatibility and performance varies by Chromebook hardware. Careful evaluation is advised before choosing a Chromebook only for Minecraft.
