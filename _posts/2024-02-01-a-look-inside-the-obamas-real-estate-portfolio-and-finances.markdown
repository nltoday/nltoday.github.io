## An Academic's Journey to the White House
Long before Barack Obama became one of the most recognizable names in the world, he was an academic and author focused on issues of race and constitutional law. In 2004, he published his memoir **Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance** which explored his early life and educational background. The book was well received and helped establish Obama as a compelling writer and thinker on complex social issues. 
Two years later in 2006, he released **The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream** which discussed his views on how to move past divisions in America. Benefiting from an endorsement by Oprah Winfrey, the book became an immediate bestseller. Between these two works, Obama earned over **$15 million** in royalties, establishing himself as a commercially successful author before even embarking on his historic campaign for the presidency.
## A Middle-Class Upbringing in Chicago 
In 2005, then State Senator Barack Obama and his wife Michelle purchased a single-family home in Chicago's Kenwood neighborhood for **$1.65 million**. At the time, Michelle worked as a Vice President for the University of Chicago Medical Center earning around **$316,962[ annually while Barack earned approximately ](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/alameda)$103,633** as a lawyer and politician. 
They took out a sizable mortgage like many American families to afford the home, a move that belies later criticisms of the Obamas amassing great wealth through illicit means. The house reflects their middle-class roots and values established before Barack's rise to national prominence. They raised their young daughters Malia and Sasha here during Barack's initial campaigns and first term as President.
## The Historic Years in the White House
From 2009 to 2017, the Obamas of course resided in the official residence of the President, the White House. During this transformative period in American history, Barack guided the nation through the Great Recession and monumental challenges like the Affordable Care Act and the military operations to kill Osama bin Laden. All the while, Michelle championed initiatives focusing on education, health, and supporting military families.
### A New Phase Begins in the Nation's Capital  
With their tenure in the highest office concluded, the Obamas faced establishing a new chapter in Washington D.C. In 2017, they began renting an 8,200 square foot home in the exclusive Kalorama neighborhood for $22,000 per month. Nearby were also the residences of other famous figures like Jeff Bezos and Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter. After briefly renting, the Obamas decided to purchase the home in May 2017 for **$8.1 million**.

## Continued Success in Business and Philanthropy
In the years since office, both Barack and Michelle have pursued highly successful careers working to advance positive change. Barack focuses on his foundation while frequently delivering impactful public speeches. In 2018, he and Michelle signed a groundbreaking multi-year production deal with Netflix to produce films and series with inspiring messages. 
Michelle also remains an immensely popular figure through her bestselling memoir **Becoming** which broke records as the most popular audiobook of all time. Both consistently rank among the highest-earning public speakers in the world, with Barack reportedly fetching up to **$400,000** per engagement. Their combination of aptitude for communication and commitment to justice ensures their influence will be felt for generations.
## A Summer Escape on Martha's Vineyard 
To relax in the summer months, the Obamas have established roots on Martha's Vineyard, an exclusive Massachusetts island getaway for many prominent families. In 2019, they purchased an even larger estate there for **$11.75 million**. Situated on nearly 30 acres overlooking a pond, the 6,900 square foot home provides seclusion and scenic beauty. 
The purchase again drew criticism from some claiming the Obamas grew too wealthy off taxpayers. However, an examination of their finances through public record shows clear and consistent sources of income from book sales, investments, speeches, and Netflix deals that easily fund such properties. Far from corrupt figures, the Obamas handle their post-presidency judiciously and helpfully.
## Assets Accumulated Through Hard Work and Talent
Across their real estate holdings and business dealings, estimates place the Obamas' current net worth at approximately **$70 million**. While a sizable sum, one must remember they have authored multiple bestselling books and remain in high demand globally as orators and influencers years post-White House. All monies have come from willing consumers, not corruption of office.
By any reasonable view, the Obamas have more than earned what they have attained. Instead of castigation, their example highlights the potential rewards of integrity, intellect and perseverance. That an African-American family could achieve so much through graft affirms the ideal that hard work and character still matter most in America.
## Inspiring the Next Generation Through Positive Action  
Even in "retirement," the Obamas stay actively engaged for progressive causes. Through their foundation, they support emerging leaders and promote service initiatives around health, education, immigrant rights, and voting rights. 
Malia recently graduated from Harvard and followed in her parents' footsteps of civic commitment with an internship for Harvey Weinstein's production company. However, she has since distanced herself and now works for Hilary Clinton's production company. Sasha continues her studies at the University of Michigan, carrying on her family's dedication to learning.
Together, the Obamas stand as models for balanced success, responsibility and hope. Their prudent choices regarding work, philanthropy and family represent virtues all people aim to cultivate. In facing doubters with grace, warmth and achievement, they spread inspiration for a just future.
