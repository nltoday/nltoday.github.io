### The Color of Royalty
The iconic light blue worn by Italian national teams has a rich history dating back over a century. In 1861, Italy was unified under the rule of the House of Savoy, taking the Savoyards' light blue as [the royal color of unified Italy](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/dogs). For the next 85 years, this light blue, also known as **'Savoy Blue'**, became synonymous with Italian nationalism as the monarchy grew the country's identity.

### Adopting the Royal Hue  
In 1911, the colors of Savoy were adopted by Italian athletic representatives to show support for the royal family. Known as the **'Azzurri'** due to their blue uniforms, early Italian national soccer teams embraced **Savoy Blue** as a symbol of national pride. Other sports teams soon followed suit, cementing **light blue** as the defining color worn by Italian athletes on the global stage.
### A Color Steeped in Tradition
Even after Italy became a republic in 1946, **Savoy Blue** was retained in recognition of the dynasty's role in unifying the nation. Today, it remains the predominant and expected hue of Italian sporting uniforms spanning volleyball, basketball, cycling and more. Nicknamed **'Squadra Azzurra'**, the **light blue** of the Italian national soccer team in particular has become world renowned.
### A Third Kit Emerges  
While **Savoy Blue** dominates, Italy does employ another color - green - as an infrequent third kit. Introduced in 2010 as an alternative, the green third shirt sees limited use and pales in recognition next to the iconic **light blue** that citizens readily associate with Italian victory.
### Recent Triumphs in Royal Hue
Just last year, the **Italian men's national volleyball team** secured victory at the 2021 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup while dressed head-to-toe in **Savoy Blue**. Their triumphant performance underscored how over a century later, **the royal color** still brings the country success on the world stage. From its roots in Italian unification to present day, **Savoy Blue** remains engraved in the nation's sporting identity and tradition.
