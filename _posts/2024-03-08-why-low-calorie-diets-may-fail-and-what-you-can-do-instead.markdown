### What Causes Weight Gain Despite Eating Few Calories?
There are several reasons why barely eating or following a low-calorie diet may backfire and cause weight gain instead of loss. [Underestimating calorie intake](https://store.fi.io.vn/mommysaurus-mom-mom-2-kids1697-t-shirt) is common, especially with processed or restaurant foods - keeping a food diary helps get an accurate count. Another big factor is **lack of physical activity** - even on a low calorie diet, not burning enough daily calories through exercise can stall weight loss. Hormonal issues like **hypothyroidism** can also interfere with metabolism and make losing weight extremely difficult. Genetics play a role too, as some have faster or slower metabolisms that make weight regulation more challenging. Chronic **stress** elevates cortisol levels and may lead to overeating or slowed metabolism as well.

### Metabolism Slowdown from Calorie Restriction
When following a very low calorie diet, the body thinks it is starving and goes into survival mode. As a protective mechanism, the metabolism actually slows down to conserve energy. This **metabolic adaptation** makes it harder to lose weight even when continuing the calorie deficit long term. The hormones **ghrelin** and **leptin**, which regulate hunger and fullness, can also become disrupted on a low cal calorie plan. This causes constant feelings of hunger that promote overeating.
### Sustainable Weight Loss Requires Balance
To lose weight safely and keep it off for good requires finding the right **balanced calorie intake** tailored to your individual stats and activity level. Crash dieting provides only temporary results and sets the stage for weight regain. Aim to eat at least 1500 daily calories through smaller, more frequent **healthy snacks and meals**. Staying **hydrated** is key to boost metabolism. Consulting a healthcare provider can help determine a personalized calorie goal and weekly pound loss that’s realistic and won’t frustrate progress.
### Adding Physical Activity Accelerates Fat Burning 
In addition to the right calorie intake, being more active is crucial. Even moderate exercise like walking or swimming 30 minutes daily **burns extra calories** and prevents metabolic adaptation. Strength training helps preserve muscle mass that continues burning calories at rest. The combination of a modest calorie deficit through diet plus extra calories burned from exercise equates to faster, long-lasting weight reduction. Finding fun physical activities you enjoy makes sticking to an exercise routine achievable.
### Reducing Stress to Support Weight Management
Weight regulation is closely tied to stress levels. High stress stimulates the production of cortisol, a hormone that drives **fat storage in the belly area**. It also raises appetite through imbalances in hunger hormones. This combination makes it hard to control eating and lose weight when under chronic pressure. Managing stress through relaxing activities like yoga, meditation, spending time outdoors or with friends can lower cortisol to help weight management efforts. Getting enough sleep also curbs **stress eating** urges.
### Knowing When to Seek Professional Help
While making balanced lifestyle changes usually does the trick, sometimes weight loss plateaus or other issues arise that require medical guidance. Consulting a doctor is smart if weight gain occurs alongside both low calorie intake and daily activity. Signs that warrant a checkup include rapid weight gain, obesity, or lack of menstrual period in females. Doctors can evaluate for conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome, hypothyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome or other **underlying medical cause** and provide targeted treatment if needed. A **registered dietitian** can also create personalized meal plans and offer support.
