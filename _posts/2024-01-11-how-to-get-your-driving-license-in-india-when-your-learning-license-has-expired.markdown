Applying for a driving license in India can be confusing if your learning license has expired. However, there are steps you can take to get your driving license without having to restart the whole process from scratch. Here is a comprehensive guide to help you navigate this situation.
### Renewing Your Learning License
If your learning license has expired within 6 months of the expiry date, you have the option to renew it. Simply apply for a renewal on the transport department website or visit your nearest Regional Transport Office (RTO). You will need to provide your original learning license and submit the renewal fees. Once your renewal is approved, you can proceed with scheduling your driving test.

### Applying as a Fresh Candidate  
If it has been more than 6 months since your learning license expired, you will need to apply as a fresh candidate. The process is similar to initially applying for a learning license. You will need to:
- Fill out the application form with your personal details  
- Attach required documents like address proof and passport size photos
- Pay the application fees
- Submit your application online or at the RTO
- Receive your new application number 
Once your application is approved, you can book a slot for your [learning license theory test](https://store.fi.io.vn/cute-axolotl-funny-i-axolotl-questions-salamander-265/women&). Pass this, and you will be eligible to undertake your driving skills test.
### Booking for the Driving Test
When booking your test date, make sure to enter your new application number, not the expired learning license number. Mentioning the expired number may cause issues. 
After entering the correct application number, follow these steps:
- Select your preferred RTO and date for the test 
- Pay the driving test fees
- Receive the appointment confirmation  
As long as it has been at least 30 days since obtaining your new learning license, you can appear for your driving skills test on the scheduled date.
### Appearing for the Driving Test
On the day of your test, carry the required documents like your new learning license, valid ID proof and the test appointment slip. Reach at least 30 minutes before your scheduled time. 
Follow the examiner's instructions carefully during the test. Demonstrate your ability to handle basic driving maneuvers like parking, reversing, brake control etc. Once you pass, you will be issued a temporary **driving license receipt** on the spot. 
The permanent license card will be sent to you by post within a month. With this, you will be a fully licensed driver in India.
### Handling an Expired License Within 6 Months 
If your learning license expired within the last 6 months, renewing it is the easiest way ahead. Visit the RTO with your old license, fill a simple renewal form and pay the fees. 
You can then directly book your driving test without re-appearing for the learning license test. Mention your renewed learning license number while scheduling the driving skills test.
Once you clear it, you will be granted your permanent driving license without much hassle. Renewing ensures you don't have to redo unnecessary documentation or tests.
So in summary, renew within 6 months or reapply as a fresh candidate if it's been longer. With the right process, you can obtain your full license even with an expired learning permit. Let me know if you need any other assistance.
