### The Problem with Too Many Emails
Receiving too many emails can be a huge frustration. Whether they are from companies or organizations you didn't sign up for or just too frequent from ones you did, the constant flood of messages filling up your inbox can feel like a huge annoyance. There is only so much attention and time we have in a day, and dealing with unwanted emails takes both away from more important tasks. 
Being bombarded with promotional messages, notifications, and other communications we did not ask for is understandably irritating. It makes people feel like their privacy and choices are not being respected. No one wants to constantly be marketed to or reminded of things they are not interested in. This leads to anger and resentment towards the senders.

### The Issue of Not Being Able to Unsubscribe  
Another major frustration is when companies and services make it impossible or overly difficult to unsubscribe from their communications. *[Unsubscribe policies](https://store.fi.io.vn/cute-axolotl-funny-i-axolotl-questions-salamander-265/women&)* should always give users a clear, simple way to opt out if they want to. Forcing people to keep receiving emails against their will is unacceptable. It further damages brands and drives people away.
One example service that reportedly does not allow unsubscribing is Quora. This seemed unreasonable to one individual who mentioned being sick of Quora emails but unable to stop them. Not providing an ***unsubscribe option*** to respect customer preferences can potentially be seen as a violation of privacy laws in some jurisdictions. It is understandable why this would greatly annoy someone and sour their view of the company.
### Looking for Solutions to the Problem
When faced with excessive unwanted emails and an inability to opt out through normal channels, people understandably express exasperation and a strong desire for solutions. One person questioned if anyone had discovered how to unsubscribe from Quora, since the standard method apparently did not work. Another said they were tired of excessive promotions and asked companies to stop sending them emails without permission. 
The level of irritation and calls for action show how much of an impact this issue can have on user experiences and brand perceptions. No one likes to feel helpless against a barrage of unwanted communications invading their inbox. Being able to exert control over what messages they receive is important for customers.
### The Need for Clear and Respectful Unsubscribe Policies
All organizations that communicate digitally have a responsibility to respect people's privacy and preferences. Providing a clear, easy-to-use ***unsubscribe link*** in every email is a basic courtesy that protects the user experience and the company's reputation. Messages should also not be sent to those who did not explicitly sign up. 
Companies should avoid frustrating their users by making unsubscribing an overly complicated or incomplete process. Policies around communications need to thoughtfully consider how to establish and maintain mutually agreed upon interactions that do not infringe on people's autonomy or attention. Respect, clarity and control are key for any service that wants satisfied, loyal customers over the long run.
### Consumer Protection Through Legislation
In some cases, legislation may be needed to formally enshrine protections for individuals against unwanted commercial emails and lack of opt-out options. Laws like the ***CAN-SPAM Act*** in the United States aim to regulate unsolicited commercial emails by requiring clear labels, functional unsubscribe links and other standards. However, more could potentially be done. 
Services that refuse to comply with reasonable requests to stop communications should potentially face legal consequences. The consumer's right to control what marketing messages they receive through their chosen channels seems like something laws should vigorously defend. Clear and enforceable rules help balance business needs with upholding individual privacy and choice online.
Overall, the issues of excessive promotional emails and unavailable unsubscribe options understandably anger many users. Both companies and regulators have opportunities to establish guidelines that make digital interactions more respectful of people's attention, inbox space and autonomy. Mutually agreeable policies benefit customers and build trust in brands.
