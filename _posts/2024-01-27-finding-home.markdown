A story of love, care and belongingness. 
Family is not always defined by blood relations, rather by the love and care we receive from our loved ones. This is a story of three individuals who discovered the true meaning of home and family despite facing difficult circumstances early in their lives. 
### Left Behind But Never Forgotten
Soumya was left at her aunt and uncle's place as a baby, possibly because she was a girl. Though not legally adopted, she was brought up with the same love and care as their own children. **She never felt any discrimination or less privileged.** Her aunt and uncle regarded her with utmost affection, going above and beyond to fulfill her needs. In her dying days, her father could recognize only her, showing how dear she was to him.

### A Mother's Unconditional Love  
Born after 14 years of his parents' marriage, my life began with the loss of my mother. My biological father held me responsible for her death and wanted me out of his sight. Left abandoned in the hospital, my uncle selflessly took me in. As a child, I would worry for my aunt's safety each time friends talked about missing their mothers. Only in teens did I learn the truth, but it did not change the love I felt for my parents. **I received nurturing and support like any other child from my adoptive parents.**
### Resemblance Beyond Blood
Despite going through immense struggle and rejection as an infant, I was fortunate to be raised by my father's elder brother and his wife. They showered upon me the love, care and affection of parents. Even after they passed away, the memories of their unconditional bond lives within me. So strong is my resemblance to my father that people close to him almost mistook me for him after his death.   
### An Everlasting Imprint  
The selfless sacrifices of my aunt and uncle helped me overcome the void created by my biological parents. Their commitment to raise me with dignity and respect has left an indelible mark. **Family goes beyond the boundaries of DNA to become a source of solace, strength and belongingness.** Though distance by fate, the lessons of compassion they instilled will continue guiding me.
### A Story of Human Spirit 
This is a story of hope, of second chances and of unconditional human spirit. Despite harsh beginnings, these individuals found their true home surrounded by people who loved and accepted them unconditionally. **Their resilience to overcome challenges through kindness serves as an inspiration.** Some are blessed with families by blood, others discover their real family is who loves you without conditions.
### A Message of Love and Forgiveness
The profound care and empathy shown by loved ones in difficult times reaffirms our shared humanity. While past wounds take time to heal, choosing forgiveness over bitterness is what allows new bonds to blossom. [This inspiring tale sends a message that every soul deserves a chance to love and be loved](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/abrahams), regardless of circumstance of birth. May such stories instill compassion in our society and bring people together through our common need for kinship.
