### Exploring Human Jumping Records
The [highest human standing vertical jump](https://yt.io.vn/collection/alan) was achieved by Evan Ungar of Canada at an impressive height of 5.3 feet or 1.616 meters. This stands as a good measure of the maximum height a human can raise their center of mass in a pure vertical leap. Meanwhile, the record for the **men's high jump** is held by Javier Sotomayor who cleared an incredible height of 8 feet and 15/32 inches or 2.45 meters back in 1973. How was Sotomayor able to get his entire body over the bar without lifting his center of mass that high?

### Leveraging Mechanics in the High Jump
High jumpers are able to exceed their standing vertical jump heights through clever application of mechanics. By forcing their upper body, head, and lower legs down while arching their back and bending their knees, athletes create a curved body shape as they pass over the bar. This allows their hips to rise high enough to clear the bar even while their center of mass remains lower, under the bar. It's estimated high jumpers can raise their center of mass around 2-2.5 feet higher than a standing vertical jump through converting some of the kinetic energy gained from their running start.
### Pushing the Limits of Jumping in Low Gravity
On smaller planets and asteroids with lower surface gravity, the maximum height a human could theoretically jump would not be constrained in the same way. In fact, on an object small enough, it may be possible to jump with enough velocity to reach **escape velocity** and leave the surface entirely. But what is the minimum size body this could occur on? To determine this, we must calculate escape velocities and compare them to known human jumping abilities.
### Calculating Escape Velocity on Small Bodies  
Escape velocity is defined as the minimum speed an object needs to break free of a planet or asteroid's gravitational pull entirely and enter outer space. It can be calculated using the formula:
**Vesc = âˆš(2GM/r)**
Where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planetary body, and r is the radius. For small, low-mass asteroids, escape velocities will be surprisingly low. Plugging in parameters for asteroids as small as 100 meters in diameter reveals escape velocities under 5 meters/second - well within human jumping capabilities.
### Could Jumping Achieve Escape Velocity?
Now we can consider if a standing long jump could realistically impart enough velocity. Even conservatively estimating the highest possible jump at 2.5 meters, simple kinetic energy and velocity calculations show any body 100 meters or less in diameter could theoretically be escaped via a standing long jump. The first asteroid a fit human athlete may be able to jump from and reach escape velocity would be an incredibly small asteroid with a diameter of only 80-100 meters! Of course, factors like rotation and terrain would influence practical feasibility.
### Pursuing the Ultimate "High Jump" Record 
While certainly dangerous and impossible with today's technologies, the idea of an astronaut leaping from an asteroid small enough to reach escape velocity through jumping alone presents an intriguing theoretical limit for human athletic ability. If able to propel themselves the needed 5 meters/second or so, they would achieve the first ever verified "planetary escape velocity high jump" and break all earthly jumping records simultaneously. Locating a candidate asteroid with suitable conditions and developing means to safely attain it could open a whole new frontier for extreme sports. However, logistical challenges abound and safety will rightfully remain the top priority for any real attempt. For now, we can only marvel at what might one day be possible as humans continue pushing physical limits in new environments.
### Conclusion
In closing, by applying basic mechanics and known human jumping abilities, we've determined the theoretical minimum size asteroid a fit person may be able to jump from and reach escape velocity - estimated around 80-100 meters in diameter. While certainly a long way from practical realization today, this hypothetical scenario offers an intriguing thought experiment on the limits of human athletic potential. Perhaps one day in the more distant future, as space travel becomes more routine, attempts can be made to edge incrementally closer to verifying this theoretical "ultimate high jump" record on a small asteroid body. For now, we'll have to settle for being spectators as records continue falling here on Earth.
