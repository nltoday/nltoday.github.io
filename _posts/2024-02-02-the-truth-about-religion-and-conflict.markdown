### A Complex Relationship  
As the input discusses, there is no simple or straightforward relationship between religion and conflict. While religions are often used to justify warfare and violence, they are not necessarily the underlying cause. There are also differences between religious faiths in how much they encourage fanaticism among followers. More moderate religions may exert some moderating influence on behaviours through their teachings about ethics and caring for others, even if those standards are not always upheld in practice. 
Some key factors that influence the connection between religion and conflict include the [specific theological doctrines](https://store.fi.io.vn/woman-cant-resist-her-shiba-inu-dog-lover-1), how **rigidly orthodox** a faith is, the level of **religious pluralism** in a society, and individual interpretations of religious texts and traditions. Fundamentalist strands within religions are more likely to view other faiths or lack of faith as existential threats. Religions themselves are complex with variations in how liberally or conservatively they are practiced in different communities and eras.

### Less Religious Societies Do Not Eliminate Conflict  
Examination of societies with low levels of religious belief and participation shows they still experience social and political disputes. In countries like the **Scandinavian nations** and **New Zealand** where polls find high numbers of atheists and low church attendance, crime rates tend to be lower but not nonexistent. They also face struggles related to issues like **income inequality** and tensions between indigenous and colonial-era populations. 
Complete removal of religious institutions and doctrines would be nearly impossible given freedom of belief is a basic human right in most modern democracies. It is also unclear if this would solve underlying human drives for conflict or means people would not find new causes for aggression and hatred. Nationalism and ethnic pride are alternative rallying points that also inspire violence and intolerance in some contexts.
### Religion as One of Many Possible Triggers  
While some religious teachings emphasize love and harmony, others emphasize separation from outsiders which can enable conflicts. However, religions are complex with variations in interpretation. Not all religious believers are extremists, and not all conflicts stem from theological divides. **Political ideologies, economic disparities, disputes over land and resources** are also frequent triggers of violence throughout history with or without a religious component. 
Many factors contribute to a society's level of peacefulness or turmoil. Religion is one influence among many that depends highly on specific contexts. Even in largely secular nations, **tensions can emerge over immigration policies, cultural assimilation** expectations for minorities, and disagreements in political philosophies. A world without religious belief might eliminate one pretext for fighting, but humans would likely continue finding new rationales for hostility and aggression based on other identity markers or disputes over power and resources. 
Overall, the relationship is nuanced with multiple dimensions rather than a simple correlation. While some religious interpretations have enabled intolerance, faith teachings are not monolithically at fault for conflicts. A diversity of perspectives within and between faiths also complicates broad generalizations about the impacts of religion on peacefulness in societies.
