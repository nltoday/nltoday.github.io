### Profile of a Top B-School in India
IIFT Delhi is counted among India's best business schools specializing in international business. With over 50,000 students attempting its annual entrance exam and just 290 admissions, it is a highly sought-after and competitive institute to get into. [IIFT has built a strong brand reputation within the trade and commerce industries over the years](https://yt.io.vn/collection/abbate), placing many alumni in top roles especially related to **international trade management and policymaking.** 
The two-year full-time MBA program offers specializations in key areas like marketing, finance, and trade through a range of electives. Students get to choose their major only after their first year and based on the electives opted for. With small batch sizes, **IIFT continues to achieve 100% placement year-on-year** across sectors like consulting, banking, FMCG and more.

### Insider Views on Campus Life and Diversity
As a graduate of IIFT Delhi myself, I would like to share an insider perspective. The student community comes from diverse educational and professional backgrounds, though **engineering continues to be the dominant undergraduate background**. Around 40% students are fresh graduates while the rest bring prior work experience. **Gender diversity has improved over the years with the current male-female ratio at 3:1**, indicative of IIFT's efforts towards inclusivity. 
Campus life is highly competitive yet lively. **High-calibre students from premier colleges across India ensure a stimulating learning environment.** With small class sizes, there is close bonding between faculty and students. Cultural fests, magazine launch events, and industry conclaves are some of the highlights.
### Decoding the Selection Process  
Admissions to IIFT Delhi and Kolkata campus are based on a common entrance test held annually across India. Of the 50,000 aspirants, around 1000-1200 high scorers are shortlisted for the next stage involving **essay writing, group discussion and personal interview rounds testing communication and problem-solving abilities**. 
Final selection is highly stringent with just 170-120 seats across the two campuses. **Merit remains the key criterion** along with allocation as per government-mandated quotas. **Placements are never guaranteed based on one's profile alone** - consistent performance matters the most to stand out.
### Rethinking Representation Goals  
In recent years, IIFT Delhi has faced criticism for tinkering with its selection transparency. The 2017 intake saw a spike in shortlisted candidates, raising doubts about a covert increase in seats. **However, it emerged that the actual goal was to boost female candidates in the pool rather than expand capacities.**
While diversity is important, **opting for opaque selection overlooks merit**. Quota-based intake alone cannot achieve true diversity - **culture change with outreach and merit-promoting policies can help bring about inclusive growth organically over time.** Representation must not undermine quality or fairness that institutions strive to uphold.
### Restoring Lost Credibility  
Compared to other premium B-schools offering business administration programs, **IIFT rankings have declined in the past decade.** Factors like bureaucracy, slow adoption of technology and lack of infrastructure upgrades have affected its potential to compete globally. 
However, the new leadership aims to regain lost ground. Recent policy changes reflect a shift towards **greater process transparency, flexible learning options and increased industry interactions.** An upgraded new campus coming up in Delhi will foster synergy between academics and experience. If sustained with diligence, **these transformational steps can help IIFT reclaim its place among the country's finest b-schools.**
### In Conclusion
Despite facing issues, IIFT continues to be a respected name for its niche focus on international business and trade. An insightful peek behind its portals highlights both opportunities and aspects requiring reform. As one of its alumni, I believe with proactive reforms and renewed commitment to merit, **IIFT is capable of scaling new heights of excellence in management education once more.** The institute's progress will strongly impact the future of India's global trade leadership pipeline.
