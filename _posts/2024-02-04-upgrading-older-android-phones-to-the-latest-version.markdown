Android updates bring important security patches and new features to phones. However, not all phones get timely updates from manufacturers. This guide discusses different options to upgrade older Android phones to a newer Android version.
## Understanding Update Availability 
It is crucial to understand your phone's update support from the original manufacturer. Flagship phones usually receive updates for 2-3 years, while budget models get 1-2 years of support. **Check your phone's official support page** or settings menu for the latest available update. 
If the manufacturer has ended support, you cannot wait indefinitely for new updates. Third-party options become important to keep your phone secure and get the latest features. 
## Over-the-Air Updates
Many manufacturers push **over-the-air (OTA) updates** to supported phones automatically. Phones often have a "System Updates" menu in Settings to check and download any available updates.
The OTA method is hassle-free as it downloads and installs updates in the background. However, it only works if the manufacturer still releases updates for your phone model.
## Updating via Computer
Like OTA, this method also relies on manufacturer support. You need to install the manufacturer's [PC companion app](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/albino), connect your phone to the computer, and download updates through the app. 
Brands like **Sony** and **Xiaomi** commonly offer this option. The downloading and installing process runs from your computer rather than the phone itself. It works similarly to OTA updates.
## Installing Custom ROMs
When official support ends, installing custom ROMs like **Pixel Experience, LineageOS, or AOSP** becomes the best way to get a newer Android version. 
Custom ROMs are community-developed software builds based on Android Open-Source Project (AOSP) with minimal additions. Major benefits include long-term updates, de-bloated software, and a stock Android experience.
### Prerequisites for Custom ROMs
Installing custom software requires unlocking the bootloader and flashing a custom recovery first. This process varies between devices and may void the warranty. Research your phone model on XDA forums for detailed steps. 
You need to backup all data before starting, as an error could "brick" the device. Always follow guides from trusted developers only.

## Finding the Right Custom ROM 
Once bootloader is unlocked and a custom recovery installed, browse top custom ROMs for your device on XDA. Check for the latest version, bug status, security patches, and features. Opt for ROMs with an active developer community.
Popular options are **LineageOS, Pixel Experience, Evolution X,** and AOSP Extended. LineageOS focuses on calls, messages while Pixel ports stock Android UI. Choose based on needs like stock look, extra features or device optimizations. 
## Downloading and Flashing Custom ROMs
Download the latest stable or beta build of your chosen custom ROM as a zip package. Copy it to your phone's storage or microSD card. 
Reboot the phone to recovery mode and select "Install" or "Flash from storage". Navigate and select the downloaded zip package to flash it. The process can take 5-20 minutes depending upon your phone. 
Upon completion, your phone reboots into the newly installed custom ROM with the features of a newer Android version. The entire process is very rewarding for enthusiasts.
## Maintaining Custom ROMs 
Custom ROMs receive periodic maintenance updates from developers for improvements and security patches. You can either download and flash update zips from recovery or use OTA-style updates directly from the settings menu. 
Periodic full-wipes are recommended to clean caches and prevent bugs. Back up all personal data before major upgrades. Report any issues to ROM forums for fixes.
With regular updates and feedback to developers, custom ROMs prolong a phone's usable life by years compared to relying on manufacturers alone. With the right precautions, they provide a seamless upgrade path.
## Conclusion
While manufacturer updates are preferable, custom ROMs emerge as a reliable long-term solution for older Android models without support. With some technical know-how, any discontinued phone can enjoy the latest software features, better performance and ongoing security patches. Custom ROMs ensure older devices stay future-proof and secure in an otherwise short-lived market.
