### Realizing I Deserved Better
I had been dating someone for three years who I thought was the person I was most compatible with. While we had many good times together and enjoyed each other's company, the bad times were truly horrible. He struggled with alcohol abuse and would get blackout drunk whenever we went out. No matter how much I communicated that I didn't like to drink or do drugs, he continued pushing me to try them. Our relationship became very toxic as I found myself in a deep depression, emotionally and mentally drained from giving everything to support him while receiving little in return. 
After weeks of this dark depression where I could barely function, one night it finally clicked - [I deserved so much better than this](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/agrawal). I realized I didn't have to stay and tell someone how to treat me properly. If they couldn't figure it out on their own, I didn't want them in my life. It was time to prioritize my own mental health and happiness.

### Ending a Relationship Lacking Commitment
I had been seeing someone for six years who I truly cared for and thought we would eventually get married. However, when the topic of officially committing came up, things started to fall apart. He said his very religious parents would be hurt if he married someone who wasn't a member of their specific religious group. I didn't want to pretend to convert just for appearances. 
But then he defended his parents' extreme views that my parents should convert too. The disrespect and lack of commitment showed me our **long-term relationship goals were incompatible**. After many fights over it, I realized the relationship had no future. Ending things was necessary to avoid further wasted time and emotional investment.
### Incompatible Beliefs Cause a Breakup  
A breakup was still fresh when I began writing on an online forum as a coping mechanism. I had been with someone for three years who understood me deeply on an intellectual and emotional level. We were very compatible and seriously discussed marriage. However, we had fundamentally different beliefs - he was extremely religious while I am an atheist.
At first he said our differing beliefs didn't matter, but when we considered marriage seriously, his parents demanded I convert to their specific religious group. When I refused, he suddenly defended their extreme views instead of prioritizing our relationship. I realized **our irreconcilable differences in core beliefs** would always be a point of conflict. As hard as it was, ending the relationship was best for my own well-being and happiness long-term.
### Choosing Someone Else After Six Years
I had been with someone for six years who I loved deeply. But when I moved for work, the emotional distance and lack of communication in our long-distance relationship worried me. One day, I directly asked if she still had feelings for a flirty male coworker. To my shock, she told me she was confused who to choose between us after he had asked her out weeks ago. 
Six years meant nothing to her it seemed. I realized in that moment our **trust and loyalty had been broken beyond repair**. Rather than begging someone to choose me who was confused about their feelings, I calmly told her to be with the other person and ended the relationship to protect my own dignity and self-respect. It was one of the hardest things but proved necessary to move on.
### Letting Go of Unfulfilled Dreams 
Ending a three-year relationship with conflicting beliefs about marriage was still fresh. We shared an amazing connection and similar interests, making each other very happy. But when his parents' extreme religious demands surfaced, it revealed our **long-held dreams for the future were unattainable**. 
As difficult as it was, staying would have meant compromising my core values or facing constant arguments. Letting go, though painful, allowed both of us to find partners better aligned with our priorities. Writing publicly about the experience helped process emotions and gain a more objective perspective to slowly heal and move forward.
### Accepting What Isn't Meant To Be  
Reflecting back, I realized not all good relationships have happy endings. I had cared deeply for someone for six wonderful years, truly believing we would be together forever. But one move away from each other exposed trust issues I couldn't overlook. She confessed to considering another man's feelings for her, shattering what I thought was rock-solid.
As upset as I was, anger and begging would change nothing. I chose to let her go with grace, telling her to follow her heart since she was unsure of our future. Sometimes people are meant to be in our lives for a season, not permanently. Accepting **not everything is meant to last helped me find peace**. While the pain will always remain slightly, I'm grateful for the memories made and lessons learned.
### Focusing on Personal Growth 
Ending a relationship, no matter the length, is difficult and takes time to fully process emotions. For me, journaling thoughts and reflecting on why certain relationships didn't work out helped immensely. I realized in many cases, lack of compromise on big priorities like beliefs, commitment and trust indicated we weren't right long-term. 
Rather than dwell in the past, I committed to **personal growth through education, hobbies and self-improvement**. Filling time with activities boosted my confidence and sense of purpose beyond being "someone's partner." Overall, it led to healing, accepting what I can't change and being ready for a healthier, happier future when the time feels right.
### Moving Forward With Wisdom
Looking back, those relationship endings taught me important lessons about self-worth, deal breakers and knowing when to let go versus fighting for something unsalvageable. I realized compromising my core values or staying where I wasn't truly happy and supported would only lead to long-term resentment. 
While the breakups caused immense pain, reflecting on what went wrong helps me avoid repeating past **mistakes in communication, priorities and commitment levels**. I now recognize signs earlier to avoid further wasted time and emotions. Most of all, those experiences shaped who I am - stronger, wiser and better able to focus fully on a partner who will treat me as an equal with mutual love, trust and respect for a lifetime.
