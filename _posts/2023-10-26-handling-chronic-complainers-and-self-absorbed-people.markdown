### Respecting Your Own Time
We all encounter difficult people from time to time who seem unable to hold a normal conversation without complaining or going on and on about themselves. However, it's important that we respect our own time and well-being when dealing with such individuals. 
As the saying goes, you teach people how to treat you by what you allow. If someone always complains whenever you meet but never asks about you or shows interest in your life, it's understandable to feel weary of spending too much time with them. Chronic negativity and selfish behavior can be emotionally draining. At the same time, not everyone may realize how their actions are affecting others.

### Assessing the Situation  
When faced with an interaction that seems to be heading in an undesirable direction, it's wise to pause and assess the situation calmly. Consider whether this person matters to you and your goals. If so, gently redirecting the conversation or setting a time limit could help. But if the relationship isn't important or they seem unwilling to respect reasonable boundaries, don't feel obligated to engage further. 
Your mental health and priorities deserve consideration too. A pleasant goodbye may be best. However, avoid rushing away rudely if possible, as anger often breeds more anger. A kind but firm demeanor can allow disengaging gracefully.
### Understanding Different Perspectives
Before judging others too harshly, try to understand differing life experiences. An only child who rarely sees friends, for example, may struggle with proper social skills like listening and sharing the conversational spotlight. Their complaining could stem more from loneliness than deliberate rudeness. 
Others cope with anxiety, depression or other issues by talking compulsively without filters. The key is whether they're willing to accept gentle advice. True friends care about each other's well-being, not just their own needs being met. With compassion, we can help teach better habits or direct people to professional help if needed.
### The Power of Asking Questions
Rather than immediately withdrawing from difficult interactions, asking thoughtful questions can provide insight. Inquiries like "why do you think that is?" or "how does this situation make you feel?" show active listening. The response may reveal deeper struggles worth supporting a friend through. 
If complaints seem to mask low self-esteem, compliments when merited can boost confidence over time. And for talkative anxiety, touching an arm gently while saying "breathe” calms racing thoughts. With care and patience, even chronic complainers may learn healthier coping mechanisms. But one must tread carefully lest enabling dysfunctional behaviors.
### Leading by Example with Positivity
People often emulate behaviors they witness. Those prone to complaining likely had role models who did the same. By changing the conversation subject or sharing an uplifting personal story instead of engaging negativity, we plant positive seeds. A smile and optimistic outlook are contagious. 
Making a conscious effort each day to express gratitude also rewires the brain over time to focus on life's blessings rather than trivial troubles. This rubs off on others through one's demeanor and dialog. Rather than attack problems, seek resolutions and focus on things we can control. Kindness has power to help even difficult people blossom.
### Knowing When to Walk Away
After genuine attempts to understand another perspective and encourage positive change graciously, some relationships may still remain draining due to willful disregard of others. It's perfectly fine—and wise for one's well-being—to remove oneself politely from such interactions and minimize contact if needed. 
However one chooses to establish healthy boundaries, avoiding hostility and maintaining composure sets an example worth emulating. With patience and care, many interpersonal challenges can be overcome. But self-care must come before trying to "fix" people unwilling to meet us partway.
