### Contacting the Local Post Office and Carrier
The first step is to determine whether your address is incorrectly classified as a business address. **If you regularly receive mail from previous tenants who have moved out or filled change of address forms, this may indicate the address is listed as a business.** You can contact your local post office and ask to speak to your letter carrier to inquire about addressing this issue. They can submit a change request to the USPS Address Management System to reclassify the address as residential.

### Reaching Out to the USPS National Customer Support Center
If you're unable to directly contact your letter carrier, you'll need to reach out to the USPS National Customer Support Center at 1-800-ASK-USPS. Explain your situation to the representative and that previous tenants were unable to have their mail properly forwarded due to the business classification. They can advise the appropriate next steps, which may involve contacting the Office of Address Management.
### Locating the Address Management System Office
To locate the specific Address Management System (AMS) Office that handles changes for your zip code, use the USPS locator tool at https://postalpro.usps.com/ppro-tools/address-management-system. Enter your city, state, or 5-digit zip code. This will return the contact information for the office serving your area. 
### Describing the Issue to the AMS Office
Contact the AMS Office by phone using the number provided. Describe that mail is not being properly forwarded for your [residential address due to incorrect business classification](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-dog-full-moon-at-night-dog-breed-chihuahua). They'll ask questions to verify the details and understand the issue. The representative should indicate that they will update the Address Management System to correctly classify it as residential.
### Following Up After the Request
The AMS Office will provide a timeframe for the update to take effect, typically within a week. Follow up with them directly using the phone number if the update hasn't occurred as indicated. You can also use an **address validation API like Smarty’s US Street Address API tool** to verify the change by checking the Residential Delivery Indicator (RDI) value returns as “Residential” rather than “Commercial”. 
### Confirming the Change with a Test
Once the RDI value shows as residential on the API, do a test change of address to confirm everything is working properly. For example, order another pair of free at-home COVID tests without a service request being necessary due to the residential classification. If mail forwarding works successfully for the test change of address, you can be confident your permanent address has been correctly updated in the system.
### Continued Monitoring After Moving
Even after successfully changing the classification and confirming it works, continue monitoring your mail after moving from the address. Use services like Informed Delivery from the USPS to easily check for forwarded mail. Contact the original AMS Office contact if any issues arise so they can investigate further. Proper coordination between you and the AMS Office is key to resolving business to residential classification errors.
