### A Return to Truth and Rational Leadership
The past few years under former President Trump caused immense anxiety and turmoil.Constant lies and misinformation from the highest office made it difficult to discern truth from falsehood. Policy seemed erratic as rational guidance was replaced with conspiracy theories. Many like myself felt uneasy not knowing what kind of crisis may emerge from an ill-informed tweet or speech. 
It was stressful keeping up with the avalanche of [false and misleading statements](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua4325-t-shirt). Reports indicated an alarming **96% of claims were rated false or mostly false**. This took a toll not just politically but mentally. It created needless divisions and distrust among citizens when we needed unity most. Facts no longer mattered and alternative realities were normalized. 
Seeing the effect on my family and friends only compounded my unease. The stress of constant uncertainty can wear down even the strongest of minds over time. A leader's words should provide reassurance and direction in difficult periods, not serve to further confuse and mislead. When truth is so cavalierly disregarded from the highest office, it makes governing and planning for the future nearly impossible.

### A Return to Stability and Empathy
With President Biden's administration, there has thankfully been a welcome change in tone and substance. In his addresses so far, the new President emphasizes unity, truth and science-based policy. This provides a sense of much needed **stability and rationality** after the turmoil of the past four years. 
Gone are the middle-of-the-night rants and conspiracy theories.In their place is a leader who listens to experts, expresses **empathy for all Americans** and aims to depolarize our divided nation. Just having a President who is honest, factual and presidential has done wonders for the national psyche. The stress levels have reduced significantly knowing the country is **in safe and experienced hands once more**.
No longer do I lie awake worrying what new crisis may emerge from an angry tweet. Policies seem balanced and well-thought out instead of erratic knee-jerk reactions. International relationships are being mended through diplomacy and mutual respect rather than threats and insults. The message is one of **healing after darkness** and bringing people together in our shared humanity.
### A Return to Credibility on the Global Stage 
It has also been reassuring to see America's global **standing and credibility restored** on the world stage. After the turbulence of the past years, traditional allies had begun questioning America's reliability and commitment to democratic values. Trade wars and broken agreements damaged economic ties while disengagement on critical issues like climate change weakened global cooperation.
In contrast, President Biden's engagements at international summits like NATO, G7, EU etc have soothed frazzled nerves. His messages of multilateralism, human rights and commitment to shared challenges like pandemics and climate change have been welcomed. This has re-established the US as a predictable, responsible and influential partner. 
Diplomacy assumes greater importance in today's interdependent world. Through dignified, fact-based discussions the new administration aims to tackle complex issues like strategic competition with China and the Iranian nuclear program. Gone are arbitrary tariffs and threats that destabilized **critical bilateral relations**. With seasoned professionals back at the helm of foreign policy, America's mantle of global leadership stands restored after being weakened in the past few years.
### The Solace of Truth and Unity
Perhaps most importantly, the return of truth, empathy and unity in leadership has done wonders for the national spirit and eased divisions at home. After years of constant untruths that needlessly pitted citizens against each other, President Biden's emphasis on facts and bringing people together provides much needed solace. 
His calls for shared sacrifice to overcome the pandemic have resonated strongly as Americans witness science-based guidance replacing conspiracy claims. There is renewed faith in government as relief efforts address the people's most urgent needs. 
Eased by his calm and experienced leadership, the divide between urban and rural seems less stark than before. The message of hope, healing and unity helps people perceive each other with greater empathy and nuance than partisan caricatures suggest. This helps address the root causes of societal tensions in healthy, democratic ways.
Overall, the past few months have brought a reassuring return to decency, competence and honesty in government. While monumental challenges remain, being guided firmly by truth, science and a concern for all helps bring out the best in a nation. It eases anxieties and enables citizens to face future hurdles with confidence, solidarity and hope. After years of turmoil, calm and unity in leadership could not have come at a more needed time for Americans and allies worldwide.
