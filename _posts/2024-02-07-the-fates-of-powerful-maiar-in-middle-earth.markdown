### The Sacrifice of Gandalf the Grey
Gandalf fought valiantly against the [Balrog of Morgoth](https://yt.io.vn/collection/aispuro), the **epically powerful** fiery demon from the **First Age**. Their **magical battle** beneath the mines of Moria was **evenly matched** as both beings utilized their **full maiar powers**. Though mortally wounded, Gandalf was able to defeat the Balrog by sacrificing himself, **protecting Frodo** and guarding the fate of Middle-Earth from this **formidably evil** being. His noble sacrifice fulfilled his duty as one of the **Istari wizards** sent to **aid Men and Hobbits**.

### Gandalf's Resurrection as Gandalf the White
However, Gandalf's story did not end in death. As a **Maia spirit**, his essence could not truly be destroyed. He was granted a **special grace** by Ilúvatar to be returned to **new life in a renewed body**. Gandalf was **re-empowered** and took on the **greater role** of Gandalf the White to see the **Quest of the Ring** through to its **divine purpose**. Though his physical form was destroyed, as a Maia his **immortal spirit** endured and he continued his **sacred mission** with renewed **holiness and authority**.
### Saruman Falls from Grace
In contrast to Gandalf's noble sacrifice, **Saruman the White** squandered his gifts and **powers as a Maia** through pride, greed and betrayal. Allured by **visions of domination**, he **aligned with Sauron** and sought to **seize control of Middle-Earth for himself** through his **armies of Uruk-Hai** orcs. For his **treachery against the Free Peoples**, Saruman was **cast down** from his position as the head of the order. Bereft of the **support of the Valar**, he became **merely a distorted shadow** of his former self. 
### Saruman's Pathetic Downfall 
Overcome by **paranoia and lust for power**, Saruman fell completely under the **manipulation of Grima Wormtongue**. With his fortress of Isengard in **ruins** after the Ents' wrath, Saruman was reduced to a **sniveling, cowardly creature**. When he **threatened King Théoden** and the people of Rohan, **Grima took Saruman's life** in a petty act of perceived vengeance. As a Maia who had **fallen from grace**, his physical death marked the **final loss of all he once was**. His **violent end** was the **bleak result** of his **many evil choices**.
### The Fates of Powerful but Mortal Bodies
While their **spirits were eternal**, the **physical forms** the Maia took on in Middle-Earth, such as Gandalf and Saruman, **could be destroyed**. This was part of **limiting their power** so as not to **overwhelm Men**, as was the folly of Sauron. Gandalf's body perished **fighting valiantly** as a **true champion of light**. Saruman's ended in **craven disgrace** as a **pathetic shell** of his former frightful power. Both endured **centuries** of **suffering or bliss** awaiting their **judgments in the Timeless Halls**, their fates a **stark contrast** due to their **divergent paths of grace or corruption**.
### The Lingering Essence of Defeated Maiar
Despite losing his physical manifestation, as a Maia, Saruman's **spirit essence persisted**. Like **Sauron reduced** at the end of the Second Age, Saruman would have been left a **confused, malicious wraith**, though one with **no physical power** left. For **unknown ages**, his soul **wandered Arda** in a **fog of malice and deceit** before **finally facing judgement** at the **Recycling of Arda**. Even stripped bare, a Maia's **lingering essences** could **corrupt and mislead** if left to **roam unchecked**. Their utter defeat required their **spirits' healing or imprisonment** to achieve **full victory**.
### The Majesty and Tragedy of Maiar in Physical Form 
The Maiar who took **bodily shape** in Middle-Earth, such as Gandalf, Sauron, and Saruman, became **tragically mortal** yet played **pivotal roles** in its fate. While their **spirits' power was nigh-unlimited**, abiding by physical **limits and needs** presented **opportunities for both great courage and catastrophe**. Gandalf showed the **righteous path of humility and self-sacrifice** to fulfill their high purpose. But Saruman and Sauron **squandered** their gifts through **pride, greed and malice** to become **curses upon the lands**. Maiar were **neither eternally good nor evil** - their fates depended on **choices** between **light or darkness** with **severe eternal consequences.**
