### Liverpool's Clinical Attack
Liverpool's attack was in top form against Arsenal. **Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino** combined brilliantly to create chances throughout the match. While Arsenal focused on nullifying Firmino in the middle, they struggled to contain the runs of Andrew Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold down the flanks. Time and again, Liverpool's full-backs crossed into the box for their teammates. Salah and Mane were clinical in finishing the chances that came their way. Liverpool's relentless pressing also pushed Arsenal further back in their own half, limiting their ability to launch counter-attacks.

### Arsenal's Defensive Woes
Arsenal clearly aimed to sit deep and contain Liverpool through central areas. However, this tactical approach had flaws. [Shkodran Xhaka](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-chihuahua-rainbow-unicorn-lgbtq-ally-dog-lover-mom-dad-v-neck-t-shirt/men&) looked overwhelmed in midfield, regularly giving the ball away cheaply. Hector Bellerin and Sead Kolasinac struggled to cope with Liverpool's attacking width as wing-backs. At the back, **Laurent Koscielny** was a rare bright spot, but errors from Nacho Monreal and Shkodran Mustafi led directly to goals. Goalkeeper **Petr Cech** also conceded multiple goals, highlighting the fragility in Arsenal's defense. Their compact block was breached time and again by Liverpool's intricate passing and movement.
### Wenger's Questionable Selection
Some of Arsene Wenger's selection decisions raised eyebrows. Playing **Bellerin** and **Monreal** out of position as wing-backs did not pay off against Liverpool's potent wing play. **Granit Xhaka** has long struggled against top teams but continued to start despite flaws in his game. Meanwhile, **Mesut Ozil** and **Alexis Sanchez** were largely anonymous, offering little support to isolated striker **Alexandre Lacazette**. With important away games coming up, resting key players like **Laurent Koscielny** was a risk that backfired for Wenger. His tactics and team selection simply did not match up to the size of the task.
### Liverpool's Dominant Display 
Liverpool were in total control of the match. Their **counter-pressing** after losing the ball was relentless. Even when Arsenal had rare spells of possession, Liverpool swarmed them in numbers, forcing hurried passes and mistakes. With **Sadio Mane, Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino** terrorizing the Arsenal backline, there was no breathing room. Despite sitting deep, Arsenal struggled to contain Liverpool through the center. When possession switched to the flanks, fullbacks **Andrew Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold** had endless space to attack. It was a clinical all-round performance that reiterated Liverpool's status as title contenders.
### Klopp Gets Tactics Right
In contrast to Wenger, Jurgen Klopp got his tactics spot on. Starting **Loris Karius** in goal over Simon Mignolet was a good decision, as the former was rarely tested. The front **three of Salah, Firmino and Mane** gave Arsenal defenders nightmares with their pace and movement. **Jordan Henderson, Georginio Wijnaldum and Emre Can** dominated midfield passages too. Additionally, utilizing the versatility of **Andrew Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold** paid rich dividends due to Arsenal's defensive vulnerabilities out wide. It was a big away win that underlined Klopp's tactical acumen and Liverpool's quality this season.
### What Next for Arsenal? 
More defeats will further damage Arsenal's top four hopes and increase the pressure on Wenger. They face a rejuvenated Tottenham side next, which could plunge them deeper into trouble. Meanwhile, upcoming fixtures against Manchester City and Chelsea promise more misery on current form. Defensively, they remain shaky and error-prone. Attacking wise, Ozil and Sanchez seem low on confidence and ideas. Wenger must find short-term fixes, but deeper problems with recruitment, tactics and mentality remain. Liverpool have surpassed them as England's third-best team on this evidence. It seems Arsenal are destined for more disappointment unless drastic changes follow this rout.
In summary, Liverpool completely dominated Arsenal through superior pressing, chance creation and clinical finishing. While Klopp got his tactics right, Wenger's questionable selections backfired against such strong opponents. Liverpool look like genuine title contenders, but Arsenal have defensive and mental fragilities holding them back from the top level. Only significant changes can arrest their decline after this embarrassing 4-0 defeat.
