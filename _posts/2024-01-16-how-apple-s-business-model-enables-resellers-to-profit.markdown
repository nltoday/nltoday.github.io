### Why Apple Sells to Resellers at Discounted Prices
Apple relies on authorized resellers to sell the majority of its products to end consumers. Rather than compete directly with these retailers, Apple provides an incentive for them to carry and promote its products by selling inventory to resellers at a discount off the suggested retail price. [This allows resellers to purchase devices at a price lower than what consumers would pay directly from Apple](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-crazy-havanese-lady-dog-lover-v-neck-t-shirt/women&), giving them room to mark up products and earn a profit on each sale.

### How Resellers Determine Their Own Prices 
Resellers have flexibility in deciding how much to mark up Apple devices purchased from the manufacturer. Some common strategies include:
- Selling at the **Apple suggested retail price** to maximize profits per unit but require higher sales volumes to reach profitability. 
- Setting prices slightly below Apple's to be more **competitively priced** than other resellers and attract a larger customer base, hoping increased sales makes up for the reduced margin on each product.
- Offering occasional promotions or bundle deals where devices are discounted to draw in customers and promote additional accessories or services that provide supplementary revenue.
### Why Apple Doesn't Directly Discount Product Prices
While customers may wish Apple cut prices themselves, doing so would undermine the business models of their authorized reseller partners. Since resellers rely on the margin between their wholesale cost and retail price to earn a living, discounted pricing from Apple would shrink or even eliminate those margins, **reducing the incentives for stores to aggressively stock and promote Apple products.** Without capable retail partners to showcase, demonstrate, and technically support its devices, Apple's brand and sales would suffer long-term.
### How Resellers Profit Without Competing on Price
Not all resellers strive to be the lowest price seller in their markets. Alternatively, premium resellers like **Apple Premium Reseller Currys** focus on the customer experience rather than undercutting competitors. With well-trained and knowledgeable staff, sophisticated showroom displays, comprehensive warranty and support services, these retailers aim to offer the best overall shopping experience rather than simply the cheapest prices. For customers willing to pay a small premium, this premium experience and service is worth the higher cost.
### The Benefits of the Indirect Sales Model for Both Apple and Resellers
In summary, Apple's approach of selling to resellers at a discounted wholesale price benefits both the manufacturer and independent retailers. Resellers earn profits while enlarging Apple's distribution footprint. And Apple avoids competing directly with partners while still incentivizing them to invest in marketing and supporting its products. This "indirect sales model" has helped drive Apple's continued success in the computer and consumer electronics industries.
