### Preparation Challenges
I was studying in 3rd year of my BTech degree when the RBI Office Attendant notification was released in February 2021. At that time, I was dealing with multiple challenges - semester exams coming up in March, Rs. 1 lakh debt from IPL betting, continuous calls for repayment, a recent breakup, and backlogs in my 2nd year exams also due to betting. I was experiencing sleepless nights with constant headaches.

### Choosing to Take Action
Seeing this job notification, I decided to fully focus on clearing the exam to get out of my difficult financial situation. I had some prior experience with reasoning and arithmetic from previous SSC exams but no knowledge of English or banking awareness. A friend's uncle lent me money at interest to pay my debts on condition I get a job. This provided temporary relief but added more pressure to succeed.
### Intense One Month Preparation 
I prepared for 30 days without any fixed study hours or timetable - just waking up and studying all day without breaks. YouTube provided free online classes to cover my knowledge gaps in [English proficiency](https://yt.io.vn/collection/alcott) and **banking awareness topics**. I ignored my ongoing BTech semester exams and only studied 3 hours before each test. My sole focus was on maximizing effort during this preparation window.
### Writing the Exam
On the exam date in April, I felt satisfied that I gave my 100% regardless of the results. The long wait for results due to the pandemic added to the suspense. When I finally saw my roll number in the selected list, I could not believe my eyes! It was an feeling of immense relief and achievement. 
### Language Proficiency and Document Verification
After clearing the written exam, I had to pass the Language Proficiency Test and document verification stages too which were conducted over the next month. The final results were still awaited though I was selected at the previous stages.
### Paying Off Debts and Pursuing Dreams
If selected in the final results, I planned to work for 1 year to clear all my debts and interest payments accumulated. Simultaneously, I would start preparing for my dream of joining the **Indian Army Para Commandos** on the side. This job was giving me the opportunity to become debt-free and work towards a bigger goal.
### Significance of Never Giving Up
My one-line motivation "Necessity is the mother of all inventions" signified that the need to get out of my difficult financial situation pushed me to never lose focus during the crucial one month of preparation. Persevering despite challenges was key to my success in the very first attempt at a banking exam like RBI Office Attendant. 
### Wrapping Up
A focused two month preparation is sufficient to clear most bank exams. However, one must maximize practice in weaker areas instead of wasting more time on grasped topics. Facing problems head-on with determination can lead one to achieve desired outcomes. I hope sharing my experience provides learning and motivation for aspirants tackling obstacles in their paths. All the best in your endeavors!
