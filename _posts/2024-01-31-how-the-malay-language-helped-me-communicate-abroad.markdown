When traveling to different parts of the world, having the ability to communicate effectively is crucial. As someone who speaks Malay, I’ve found the language opening doors of understanding in unexpected places across borders. Over the years, encounters with individuals proficient in Malay have shown how language breaks down barriers and forges connections between cultures.
### Connecting Through Shared Language in The Netherlands
During a late night food run in Den Haag, I discovered the power of speaking Malay when ordering from an Indonesian stall. Unable to communicate in Dutch or English, using  [Bahasa Melayu](https://yt.io.vn/collection/acuff) allowed me to converse naturally with the owner. Our interaction warmed as we discussed where we were from and our jobs. I not only placed my order but received extra food—a testament to how language fosters goodwill.

### Surprising Encounters in India
While visiting friends in Trichy, India, a similar experience occurred at a local restaurant outside the city. None of the servers spoke English, but one attempted Malay. I was delighted to find another person proficient in the language from working in West Malaysia. His Malay was better than mine! We had an engaging discussion, showing how the tongues we speak link communities worldwide.
### Discovering Shared Ties in Vietnam
At Ben Than Market in Saigon, a souvenir stall vendor greeted me in broken Malay, astonishing me. I came to learn all the sellers there knew some Malay too. Their use of the language to welcome me conveyed our shared Southeast Asian identity despite geographical distance. Exchanging a few words strengthened our human connection in a bustling urban space.
### Smoothing Interactions at Airports  
Even at Schipol Airport in Amsterdam, **Bahasa Melayu** proved valuable. When going through immigration, the Dutch officer switched to Malay upon seeing my Malaysian passport. His farewell greeting of "Terima kasih" brought a smile, highlighting the language's international reach. Who would have expected to encounter Malay in the bustling transit hub of a non-Malay speaking country?
