## Understanding the Universal Account Number 
The Universal Account Number or UAN is a unique 12-digit number allotted to every member of the Employees' Provident Fund organisation to facilitate paperless transactions and portability of PF accounts. Getting a UAN number helps track an individual's PF contributions across jobs and employers. 
### Getting Your Own UAN 
To get a UAN, an individual needs to submit their Aadhaar number to the EPF organisation. The UAN generation is a one-time and free process. Once generated, the UAN is linked to an individual's Aadhaar and remains the same even if they change jobs multiple times.

## Completing KYC for Linking Bank Account  
Once allotted a UAN, it is important for individuals to complete necessary KYC procedures like adding **Aadhaar details, PAN number** and linking a bank account. This helps seamlessly withdraw PF funds from any past employment accounts.
### Adding Aadhaar and PAN Details
The Aadhaar and PAN details provided are verified with UIDAI and Income Tax databases. This acts as proof of identity and address of the member. Both details need to be approved by the current employer for official record purposes.
### Providing Bank Account Details 
The bank account provided is where the PF funds will be transferred during partial or final withdrawals. The account needs to be an active savings account in claimant's name. Bank details also require employer approval before being linked to the UAN.
## Getting Employer Approval for KYC 
Even after an individual has updated their KYC details, these remain [pending employer approval](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-crazy-boston-terrier-lady-dog-lover-v-neck-t-shirt/men&) status until approved. The employer acts as the approving authority for UAN-related activities for members currently employed with them. 
### Requesting Approval from Current Employer
Once KYC details are added via the UAN member portal, a notification is sent to the current employer for verification and approval. The member should promptly follow up with the employer's HR or accounts team through proper channels. 
### Approval Pending if No Longer Employed
If a member has changed jobs and is no longer associated with the previously entered employer, the KYC details will continue to show as **pending approval** since there is no active employer. In such cases, approval is not possible unless re-employed under EPFO.
## Benefits of Completing UAN KYC Formalities
Completing KYC verification helps establish the identity of the member, secures their PF account and enables access to PF money whenever needed. It allows **paperless portability of PF** when changing jobs and ensures easy claim settlement. Employers also benefit from an digitized records maintenance system.
# Wrapping Up 
In summary, generating a UAN, updating necessary KYC details like Aadhaar, PAN and bank account, and getting employer approval are basic formalities that help establish identity and enable access to provident fund benefits in a streamlined digital manner. Completing UAN KYC helps maintain an online PF account accessible even when changing jobs multiple times.
