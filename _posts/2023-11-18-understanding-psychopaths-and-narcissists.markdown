Psychopaths and narcissists share some similar traits but they are fundamentally different. Psychopaths are very calculating and manipulative while narcissists are driven by ego and insecurity.

Psychopaths have deficiencies in emotional processing areas of the brain which allows them to be detached and calculating. They see others merely as means to an end rather than actual people. Psychopaths are outwardly charming but inwardly lack empathy, remorse and compassion. They are master manipulators who view relationships solely in terms of what can be gained. 
**Narcissistic traits power worship praise status attention**
Narcissists have fragile egos and feel deeply insecure. They desperately crave praise, attention and to be seen as superior to fill this internal void. Narcissists seek positions of power and status not for practical gain but to fuel their ego and sense of self-worth. They are hypersensitive to any perceived threat or insult which can trigger vengeful outbursts.
## Outsmarting the Psychopath  
### Recognizing Manipulation Tactics
Psychopaths are expert manipulators who can charm their way into your life and blind you to their true nature. It is important to be aware of common manipulation tactics like flattery, playing the victim, future faking and triangulation. By recognizing when a psychopath is trying to manipulate you, their power starts to diminish.

### Gathering Covert Evidence  
Without solid proof, directly confronting a psychopath about their behavior will backfire. It is better to quietly gather covert evidence of their lies, deception and wrongdoings through discreet surveillance, FOIA requests or getting records from third parties. Screenshot worrisome communications for future reference.
### Exposing the Truth Anonymously
With covert evidence in hand, expose the psychopathâ€™s true nature anonymously to undermine their public persona and credibility. Leak proof of their lies and misdeeds to mutual friends and associates but avoid taking direct credit to prevent retaliation. Ensure the news spreads wider than the psychopath can counter or cover up.
### Making an Untouchable Escape  
Once exposed, psychopaths will desperately try to re-ingratiate themselves or seek retribution. It is important to make a clean break by avoiding all contact, changing contact details and beefing up home security. Warn trusted friends and establishments the psychopath may try to approach. With no avenues left for manipulation or retaliation, they will be forced to move on to easier targets.
## Handling the Vengeful Narcissist  
### Insult their Intelligence 
Narcissists have fragile egos and see themselves as superior and uniquely gifted. Directly challenging this perception with well-placed insults about their lack of intelligence or common sense can shake them to their core. Narcissistic supply comes from feeling admired and respected, so undermine this supply by planting seeds of doubt about their actual capabilities and intellect.   
### Mock their Masculinity/Femininity
Gender plays a big role in the narcissistic identity. For male narcissists, mock or emasculate their masculinity. For female narcissists, suggest they are not as attractive, feminine or desirable as they think. Questioning their gender adequacy is deeply wounding because it challenges a core component of how they see and define themselves.
### Publicly Humiliate with the Truth
One of the most damaging things for an attention-seeking narcissist is public humiliation that strips away the false image they have worked to cultivate. Expose contradicting evidence of their lies and misdeeds in front of mutual acquaintances so they can no longer deny it or spin their version of events. Ensure maximum public embarrassment.
### Disappear Without Explanation 
An enraged narcissist whipped into a vengeful frenzy will stop at nothing to inflict pain when you have damaged their ego. Make a complete exit from their life and connections without closure, confrontation or triggers. Simply fade out of their world leaving them with no supply, answers or avenue for retaliation. The unknown will torment them far more than any confrontation ever could.   
## The Importance of Self-Care
Dealing with manipulative and vengeful individuals can take a psychological toll. It is essential to practice self-care and protect your mental well-being. Strategies like journaling, meditating, spending time with supportive people and engaging in stress-reducing hobbies or exercise can help process disturbing experiences and keep you centered emotionally. Ultimately, staying above the fray and refusing to engage on their terms is the most effective way to maintain power and win the long game.
