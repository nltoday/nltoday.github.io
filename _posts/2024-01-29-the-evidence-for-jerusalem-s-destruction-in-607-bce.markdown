### # Analyzing the Chronology
The timeline of events related to Jerusalem's destruction is central to understanding the chronology debate between mainstream Christian scholars and Jehovah's Witnesses. Key dates such as when Nebuchadnezzar II laid siege to and conquered Jerusalem, and the length of the Babylonian exile are pivotal in determining whether 607 BCE or 587/586 BCE is correct. Let's carefully examine the biblical and secular historical evidence around these events.
Jerome, a 5th century priest and scholar, made the earliest attempt to synchronize biblical events with secular history by corresponding the first year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign to 605 BCE based on Babylonian records. However, excavations and tablets uncovered in modern times tell a different story. Nebuchadnezzar first became coregent in 605 BCE under his father Nabopolassar, but did not begin his solo reign until 604/603 BCE. Complicating matters further is conflicting dates in Babylonian king lists for his accession year. Mainstream scholars thus place Jerusalem's destruction either in 587/586 BCE or some time in the late 590s BCE based on [Babylonian cuneiform records](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-duck-gift-for-mom-mother-duckling-duck-waterfowl-lovers-v-neck-t-shirt/women&) and **synchronisms with Egyptian history**.
Jehovah's Witnesses disagree, claiming Jerusalem fell in 607 BCE based on their calculation of various prophetic “times” in Daniel and Revelation. But are **time prophecies** always meant to be taken literally? Prophecy often uses symbolic or cryptic language open to interpretation. Absolute dates should be determined from clear historical facts, not speculative interpretations of symbolic time periods. Let's examine the primary reasons cited for the 607 BCE date.

### Calculating From Hezekiah's 14th Year 
The Bible states Hezekiah became king of Judah in the third year of Hoshea, king of Israel, which corresponds to 715 BCE. 2 Kings 18:13 says Sennacherib of Assyria attacked Jerusalem in Hezekiah's 14th year, or 701 BCE. Adding the length of subsequent Judean kings' reigns, Jehovah's Witnesses arrive at 607 BCE for Jerusalem's destruction. But scholars note several inaccuracies:
- Assyrian records show Sennacherib attacked in 701 BCE, not 704 BCE as required by the 607 date. 
- Some coregencies are omitted which actually extend Hezekiah's pre-614 BCE reign. 
- Babylonian exile texts validate the post-614 reign lengths utilized by historians.
The biblical passage cites Hezekiah's 14th year without clarifying if it refers to his sole reign or including his coregency. Scholars doubt the accuracy of combining minimal reign lengths. Secular evidence overwhelmingly supports Jerusalem's fall near the end of the 6th century BCE.
### # Corroborating Nebuchadnezzar's Reign
Another key proof text for 607 BCE is the fulfillment of Jeremiah's prophecy that Nebuchadnezzar would rule for 70 years over subjected nations (Jeremiah 25:11). But did he truly reign for exactly 70 years? Some potential issues:
- Nebuchadnezzar ruled concurrently with his father Nabopolassar for part of the prophesied period. 
- Ancient kings often had coregencies which complicate determining precise beginning and ending points of singular reigns. 
- Babylonian king lists show gaps and differences over exact succession and reign lengths. Absolute precision is impossible.
While Jeremiah's prophecy was fulfilled generally, the 70 years need not correspond to Nebuchadnezzar's sole reign but could symbolize Babylon's supremacy over surrounding countries. Archeological findings and classic texts indicate Jerusalem fell around 586 BCE, which better synchronizes with this king's rule from 605/604 BCE until his death in 562 BCE. 
### What Do Secular Records Reveal?
Finally, we examine the strongest evidence - contemporaneous accounts from surrounding empires. Egyptian papyri and Babylonian tablets provide the closest actual documentation of these events near the end of the 7th century BCE. Key points:
- Babylonian King Nabopolassar began his rule in 626 BCE and established independence from Assyria.
- In 605/604 BCE, Nebuchadnezzar defeated Egypt at Carchemish and became coregent with his father.    
- Tablets dated to 595/594 BCE record tributepayments to Nebuchadnezzar from various kingdoms he had subjugated, including Judean King Jehoiakim. This fits with a late 590s destruction of Jerusalem under Nebuchadnezzar, not 607 BCE.
- Nebuchadnezzar is documented fighting Egypt in 574572 BCE near the end of his reign, not decades earlier as required by the 607 date.  
Secular histories point conclusively to Jerusalem's fall circa 587/586 BCE during Nebuchadnezzar's reign as fully consistent with Babylonian and surrounding regional chronologies. Absolute trust in the 607 date contradicts extensive archeological evidence.
# Conclusion
While Jehovah's Witnesses have proposed reasonable interpretations, closer examination reveals their chronological methodology relies too heavily on speculative calculations of symbolic biblical time periods rather than factual historical records. The preponderance of evidence from **Babylonian king lists, Egyptian papyri, and archeological findings** consistently places Jerusalem's destruction sometime between 597-586 BCE, not 607 BCE as claimed. Continuing study and reconsideration of this pivotal date may help bring greater accuracy and historical credibility to understanding scriptural prophecies. The truth is best discerned through objective analysis of all available facts, not rigid adherence to predetermined conclusions.
