### Looking for "Soulmates"
Many believe that astrology can accurately predict compatability and long-term success in relationships. By analyzing birth charts and calculating "gun milan" points, astrologers claim to be able to identify your perfect "soulmate." However, my experience shows that these predictions don't always prove true. [My first engagement and relationship](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-santa-christmas-tree-lights-funny-xmas-pajama-boys-426-chihuahua-dog) showed high gun milan points but turned out to be physically and emotionally abusive. **My subsequent relationships** that also scored well according to astrology all ended badly, with infidelity and deception.

### Love is Not Determined by the Stars
While astrology can give insights into personality traits and compatibility, true love and relationship success depend on much more than horoscope matching. **A long-lasting marriage** requires daily effort, communication, compromise, and faithfulness - not just favorable astrological alignments. My husband of many years scored quite low on our astrological comparison, but our relationship is strong because we prioritize caring for each other and our family every day. No astrological prediction can guarantee how two people will choose to treat one another.
### Learning from Failed Relationships 
My early experiences dating men with supposedly ideal astrological matches taught me valuable lessons. No science, whether astrology, numerology or other occult studies, can override free will or determine how two individuals will interact. **Our daily choices** and level of commitment to each other are much more significant than astrological factors. While astrology gave an **initial impression of compatibility**, it failed to account for core issues like abusive tendencies, infidelity, deception or inability to commit that ultimately doomed those relationships.
### A Practical Partnershipprevails over Predictions
In contrast, my current marriage has endured because my husband and I prioritize supporting each **other and our children** through both easy and difficult times. We communicate openly, respect each other's families, and make daily **small sacrifices** like cooking meals together or running errands to strengthen our bond. Astrological algorithms calculated years ago cannot compete with day-to-day living, growing and problem-solving as a team. No matter the **initial predictions**, love emerges from practical compassion, not magical forces beyond our control.
### Trust Relationshipsat Face Value, Not Calculated Compatibility 
With more than a decade of marriage experience, I no longer place any stock in astrological relationship readings. Compatibility involves constant learning and adjustment between two autonomous people - not vague destiny claimed by celestial positioning years past. While fun or interesting to explore, **no occult science should replace open-mindedness, effort and forgiveness** in a bond between individuals who continue evolving. True intimacy emerges from within, not without, so I advise judging partnerships based on observable virtues like loyalty, partnership and care - not numerological abstractions.
### Focus on Building Understanding, Not Foretelling the Future
In conclusion, astrology can ignite imagination about personality and dynamics, but should never substitute for communication, commitment and daily nurturing between two people. No esoteric formulae or past life readings can dictate respect, patience and willingness to understand each other as complex whole individuals. **Future success depends on presence, not prophecy**. Rather than relying on astrological fortune-telling to choose relationships, focus energy on cultivating empathy, teamwork and caring friendships that can transform into love through shared experience - not calculated charts. Therein lies the heart of a lasting union.
