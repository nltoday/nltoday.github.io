### Early Methods of Counting
Early humans were nomadic in nature and needed efficient ways to keep track of quantities without relying on physical objects. Looking at their own bodies, they realized their fingers provided a natural counting system. This is believed to be the origin of the decimal numeral system, with 10 fingers corresponding to the base-10. However, other numerical bases were also used by ancient civilizations for their practical advantages in daily tasks and record keeping.

### The Base-20 System of the Maya and Aztec
Some early cultures counted using 20 as the base, reflecting the total number of fingers and toes on the human body. This **base-20 numeral system** was prominent among the Maya and Aztec civilizations, with specific names assigned to multiples of 20 up to the power of 6. Counting in a base of 20 had benefits as numbers were easily divisible by 1, 2, 4, 5, and 10. Traces of this system remain today in the use of "score" to denote 20 items. The base-20 likely emerged as an intuitive way to quantify larger amounts for societies dependent on agricultural accounting.
### Convenience of Base-12 in the Fingers  
Counting the [[finger phalanges](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/alban)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_bone) provides 12 segments, making 12 a simple and memorable base to use. Dividing quantities among 12 parts has practical advantages, as 12 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. This is believed to be behind terminology like "a dozen," which remains in use today. Base-12 systems may have been widespread in ancient civilizations for their user-friendly nature well-suited to tasks like basic arithmetic and fair redistribution.
### The Powerful Base-60 System of Babylonians and Vedic Culture
Ancient Mesopotamian societies like Babylon evolved the highly efficient **sexagesimal numeral system** using 60 as the base. Counting the knuckles on both hands signed and unsigned provides 12 * 5 = 60 segments, making 60 memorable and natural to employ. More importantly, 60 has more factors than any other number between 1 and 12, allowing easy conversion between fractions. This base-60 system streamlined tasks from trade and astronomy to timekeeping. Elements of it endured in early Vedic culture in India along with base-10 and base-12 methods.
### Measuring Time Cycles with Base-60 
Early astronomers keenly observed nature's cycles and sought to quantify time in a structured format. Seasonal changes and moon phases presented unambiguous **periodic phenomena** to contemplate. The near-365 day tropical year cycle was a given, but dividing it precisely proved challenging. Base-60 systems emerged as the optimal solution. Since 360 is divisible by 60, representing a year as 360 degrees allowed breaking it down seamlessly into months, days, hours and fractions thereof using the same base. 
### The Egyptian Calendar's Use of 360 Days
Scholars believe the 360-day calendar of ancient Egypt employed 360 degrees to represent the ideal year length, ignoring fractional remainders. With 12 thirty-day months, it totaled 360 calendar days. An additional 5 days were added as supplements outside the regular months. This **aliquot-part system** allowed inaccuracies to be tracked incrementally. Considering Egyptians pioneered geometry and the pyramids demonstrate advanced mathematical skill, the choice of 360 for their solar calendar was likely not arbitrary but based on base-60 reasoning.  
### Revealing Connections through Numerology
Playing with the properties of numbers using unit fractions as the Egyptians did provides insights into early mathematical thinking. Calculations show a 365-day year is offset by 1 day every 4 years - the same angular distance the sun travels in 4 complete circles as measured in their 360-degree system. Similarly, dividing a day into 24 equinoctial hours of 60 minutes each results in 1440 minutes, equal to the degrees in 4 circles or the error in a 365-day calendar every 4 years. Ancient numerology reveals sophisticated understandings was already developed long before modern mathematics was formalized.
