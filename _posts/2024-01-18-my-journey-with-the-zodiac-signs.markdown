Astrology enthusiasts try to find patterns about personality traits and luck by analyzing the positions of celestial bodies at the time of one's birth. While the science behind astrology is questionable, many still find meaning and enjoyment in associating their traits and experiences with their signs. This is my personal journey exploring relationships with different zodiac signs.
## Unreliable Geminis 
Geminis are known for being **inconsistent, two-faced communication** according to astrological stereotypes. This held true in my experience as well. The Gemini men I dated were flirty and fun at first but lacked commitment or attention span down the line. One Gemini boyfriend would sporadically change plans at the last minute or ignore my texts for days. Another was a serial flirt who couldn't keep conversations exclusively with me. The one Gemini female friend I had also proved untrustworthy after repeatedly sharing secrets I told her in confidence. While not all Geminis may be this way, these experiences left me wary of the sign.
## Violent Aquarians
Aquarians have a reputation for being **tempestuous, unconventional individuals.** The few Aquarius people I encountered lived up to this in volatile ways. One Aquarius ex took his anger out physically during arguments, leaving me terrified. Another Aquarius friend had a short fuse and would lash out aggressively over small issues. Even Aquarius acquaintances seemed perpetually irritated and aloof. Their unpredictable, eccentric nature may appeal to some, but for me it created an unstable environment I didn't feel safe or comfortable in. Respect and communication are especially important in any relationship involving an Aquarius.
## Self-Absorbed Leos 
Leos supposedly crave recognition and praise above all else. The Leos I dated definitely embodied this **narcissistic, attention-seeking nature.** One Leo boyfriend constantly needed to be the center of attention and would sulk if I ever received a compliment without him. He also struggled with jealousy if I socialized without him. A Leo friend similarly demanded the spotlight in conversations and her stories always seemed to be about her own great accomplishments. While a healthy amount of confidence is attractive, their excessive self-involvement made it exhausting to maintain a connection. Modesty and empowering your partner are qualities missing in the Leos I experienced.
## Manipulative Scorpios
Scorpios have a dark sexual mystique about them but can also be **secretive, power-driven partners** according to astrological profiles. The Scorpios from my past typified this in toxic ways. One Scorpio ex-boyfriend was psychologically and emotionally abusive, gaslighting me into doubting my own reality. He enjoyed having power and control over me. A Scorpio fling similarly manipulated me for attention and tried to isolate me from friends. Their vindictiveness if crossed was palpable as well. While passion and intensity can be alluring traits, the manipulative undercurrents I dealt with soured me on the sign altogether. Healthy communication and respect for boundaries are missing in toxic Scorpios.
## Traditional Tauruses 
Tauruses are considered steadfast and traditional but also potentially **stubborn, set-in-their-ways partners.** The Taurus man I dated fit this description to an extreme. He expected me to be a homemaker without an identity outside of taking care of him. Any differing opinion I expressed was dismissed. Attempts to broaden his horizons were also met with resistance. A female Taurus friend also clung tightly to convention and judged others who deviated from the norm. While loyalty and reliability are virtues, their rigid insistence on tradition proved too restrictive for my free-spirited nature. Flexibility and respect for individuality are qualities missing in the controlling Tauruses of my past.  
## Renewed Hope
These experiences left me disenchanted with astrology and dating for a long time. However, I've since realized people cannot be defined by speculative attributes alone. Healthy relationships require mutual respect, care, communication and compromise - qualities that exist beyond star charts. Now when exploring a new connection, I pay more attention to how someone treats me and others day-to-day than any supposed traits. Perhaps down the line I'll take another chance to rewrite my stories with certain zodiac signs - or maybe my life partner will surprise me by defying expectations. For now, I keep an open yet discerning mind.
