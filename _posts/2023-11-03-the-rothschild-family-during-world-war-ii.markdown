## Escaping from Nazi Occupied Europe
The Rothschild family faced immense challenges and difficulties when Nazi Germany rose to power and occupied large parts of Europe during World War II. Being a prominent Jewish family, they were targets of persecution by the racist Nazi ideology. However, most members of the wealthy Rothschild family managed to escape before it was too late, using their resources and connections. 
### Aleece Rothschild's Dangerous Journey
One such story is of [Aleece Rothschild](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/ager), who was born in Germany in 1915. In 1939, while on holiday in France, her passport was stamped with "Jude" when Nazi Germany invaded. She was trapped as a Jew in occupied territory. With help from a French resistance fighter named Abe Garsh, who later became her husband, she obtained a false passport. They joined refugees trying to reach Spain through the treacherous Pyrenees mountains, surviving harsh weather, German patrols, mines and barbed wire fences.

### Surviving a Sunken Ship
Reaching Spain, they hoped to find a ship to America or England. However, they were arrested as spies by Spanish authorities. After weeks of interrogation and torture, the British consulate helped secure their release. They boarded a ship for New York, but it was sunk by a German submarine in the Atlantic. Incredibly, Aleece and Abe survived and were rescued, later flying safely to London.
## Remaining family Members Faced Difficulties
### Louis Nathaniel de Rothschild's Imprisonment 
Some Rothschild family members faced difficulties despite escaping. **Louis Nathaniel de Rothschild** was a Baron living in Vienna, Austria. After the 1938 Nazi annexation of Austria, he was arrested at the airport and imprisoned because he was a prominent Jewish businessman. He was only released after lengthy negotiations and a ransom of $21 million, believed the largest for an individual. Though imprisoned, he impressed SS leader Himmler during a visit.
### Surviving the Holocaust in Jamaica
Allowed to leave Austria, Louis survived the Holocaust and World War II. He owned a spectacular Vienna palace housing fine art, which the Nazis plundered. He never recovered most possessions, relocating permanently to Montego Bay, Jamaica where he died in 1955 while swimming.
### Philippe de Rothschild Joins the Resistance 
**Philippe de Rothschild** 's French property was seized after the 1940 Nazi occupation of France. His estranged wife Elisabeth was deported to the Ravensbrück concentration camp in 1941 on false charges, dying in 1945. Philippe safely reached England and joined the Free French Forces of General de Gaulle, earning military honors.
## Tragedies Faced by Family Members
### Elisabeth de Rothschild's Tragic Fate
The only Rothschild to die in the Holocaust was **Elisabeth de Rothschild**. In 1941, attending a fashion show in occupied France, she was arrested for slightly changing seats, offending the wife of a high-ranking Nazi ambassador. Deported to Ravensbrück, she reportedly died of typhus in 1945. Her husband later said she was thrown alive into a crematorium oven. 
### Ravensbrück: The Notorious Women's Camp  
Ravensbrück was a notorious Nazi **concentration camp for women**, located near Berlin. Over 130,000 women from across Europe were imprisoned there for political and racial reasons between 1939-1945. 50,000 are estimated to have perished from disease, starvation, overwork or murder in the gas chambers. Elisabeth fell victim to the brutality and inhuman conditions at this site.
## Survival and Rebuilding After Liberation
Despite immense hardship and loss, some Rothschild family branches survived the Nazi onslaught. With Allied victory in 1945, they faced the challenge of rebuilding after most of their European assets were stolen or destroyed. 
### Return to France and Vineyard Revival
Philippe de Rothschild returned to France and worked to restore the vineyard he had inherited. Against all obstacles, he revived the region's wine industry and **Château Mouton Rothschild** to global prominence. His perseverance symbolized the family's resilience in overcome adversity through the generations.
### Starting Anew in Other Countries 
Many Rothschilds who fled Nazi lands started new lives in countries like Britain, United States, South Africa and elsewhere. **Louis Nathaniel de Rothschild** found refuge in Jamaica after his narrowly escaping imprisonment and death in Austria. The far-flung family supported each other to survive the tragedy and go on flourishing internationally.
Their inspiring story of overcoming immense suffering shows humanity's ability to survive even the darkest times through courage, resourcefulness and solidarity. While some members fell, the Rothschild family endured and thrived, ensuring its long legacy continued. Even amid chaos, hope and renewal are possible with determination and community aid.
