### # When is the Right Time to Introduce Solids
Introducing solids too early can disrupt breastfeeding and increase the risk of food allergies and obesity later in life. Babies should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months to obtain optimal nutrition. The general consensus is to wait until six months before introducing solids. 
Some key signs that a baby may be ready for solids include: - Being able to sit comfortably with support - Showing interest in food that others are eating - Good head and neck control to prevent choking - Moving food from the front of the mouth to the back to swallow

### # Starting with Purees and Semi-Solids 
Once baby is six months old, parents can begin introducing [pureed vegetables and fruits](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-blue-chihuahua-dog-weightlifting-in-fitness-gym-chihuahua-dog) along with **semi-solid foods**. Good first foods include pureed beans, sweet potatoes, carrots, apples, and bananas. These soft foods allow baby to get used to new textures and flavors in their mouth without risk of choking. 
Some tips for starting solids are to feed with a spoon, allow baby to feed themselves, start with 1-2 teaspoons per meal, and avoid mixing cereals into bottles. It's best to introduce one new food at a time spaced 3-5 days apart to monitor for any allergies. Meals should be before breastfeeding or formula.
### # When to Introduce Fruits
Most experts recommend waiting to introduce acidic or allergenic fruits until around nine months of age when a baby's immune system has further developed. Good first fruits include Bananas, avocado, and **mashed apples or pears** which are mellow in flavor. Citrus fruits like oranges should be delayed until after one year old.
Juices are also not recommended for babies under one as they lack nutrients and can contribute to tooth decay and diarrhea. Itâ€™s best to feed whole foods that baby can feed themselves to encourage development. By nine months, mellow berries in small pieces could also be introduced.
### # Adding Textures and Finger Foods 
Once solids are established at around seven to eight months, parents can start mashing foods less and add different textures. Chopped soft vegetables and fruits help build chewing skills. 
**Finger foods** are excellent for developing motor skills and independence. Good first finger foods include soft pieces of banana, avocado, cooked pasta or rice, pieces of toast, and shredded cheese. Finger foods should be cut into small pieces childproofed to prevent choking. S
mooth yogurts with bits are also a great transitional food for building up textures they can feel in their mouth. Choking becomes less of a risk as baby approaches their first birthday and they can try chopped fruits, vegetables and meats. Keeping mealtimes happy and low pressure is important.
### # Common Concerns when Introducing Solids
It's normal for babies to refuse certain foods initially as they adjust to new tastes and textures. Don't force baby to finish their plate. Some may eat minimal amounts while going through a growth spurt. As long as they continue breastfeeding or formula well, it's fine. 
Diarrhea, constipation or facial rashes could point to a food allergy. Stop that food and see a doctor as needed. Choking is a risk under one year old, so never leave baby unattended with food and cut into very small pieces. Always supervise mealtimes.
With patience and letting baby set the pace, most grow to enjoy family meals. The priority is obtaining nutrition from breastmilk or formula in the first year. Introducing solids is an enriching part of their culinary journey but don't feel stressed if it takes time. Trust your baby's cues and stick to age appropriate guidelines.
### # Continuing Exploration Beyond One Year 
Once over the one year mark, many textures and foods can be introduced. Continue exposing baby to a variety of healthy home-cooked meals with their family. Self-feeding with utensils is a major developmental step at this stage and practicing independence at the table is important.  
Cow's milk can be given in moderation between 12-24 months as an additional beverage. Limit 100% fruit juice to 4oz/day or less as it lacks nutrients filler found in whole fruits. At 15 months, nuts can be introduced in small pieces if no allergy risk. 
Keep safety in mind and avoid choking hazards like popcorn, raw carrots, grapes cut in rounds, hotdogs cut in rounds. Listen for signs of readiness before introducing new challenges. By age two, most have graduated from purees and become eager participants enjoying cuisines from many cultures. Never stop supervising mealtimes and always offer water with meals.
