## The Underpaid and Overworked Reality 
Roblox's massive popularity hides an ugly truth - the exploitative treatment of its outsourced customer support team in India. As a former employee, I saw firsthand how the company prioritized profits over people.
### Working Long Hours for Little Pay
Roblox paid us a meager **$400 USD per month**, equivalent to just **$2 USD per hour**. **This was far below India's minimum wage** and a pittance compared to what their US employees earned. Yet the pressure to meet unrealistic quotas was immense. We had to resolve [80 tickets in only 10 hours](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-holiday-santa-riding-rottweiler-dog-christmas-2), meaning addressing 8 upset customers **each stressful hour** without breaks.

### Relentlessly Tracking Our Every Move
Management constantly scrutinized our performance through **intrusive monitoring software**. The slightest mistakes or delays handling tickets would result in written warnings or worse. There was no leniency given, no matter the circumstances. Self-care and mental health were not priorities - only metrics and targets mattered to Roblox.
## A Toxic Work Culture that Endangered Lives
### Forced to Risk Covid Exposure in the Office  
During India's catastrophic second Covid wave, Roblox showed little care for employee safety. They dragged us into the crowded office even after **positive cases in the building**, with **no options** to work remotely. Tragically, one young colleague contracted the virus at work and **died from Covid complications**.
### Rotating Night and Day Shifts Wreak Havoc
To cram more people into limited space, Roblox instituted a rotation where half the team worked **nights for 2 months, then days**. This disrupted natural sleep patterns and **took a severe toll on mental wellbeing over time**. Health impacts were disregarded for the sake of cramming more "resources" (as we were coldly called) into the office.
## Speaking Out Against Systemic Abuses
### Threats of Lawsuits for Whistleblowing
Former employees face **legal intimidation if exposing the truth about conditions**. I risk retaliation by anonymously sharing my experience to warn others. Someone must stand up against the hidden injustices perpetuated through outsourcing to developing nations. 
### Hoping My Story Sparks Positive Change
Roblox claims to be a fun platform for children, but its profits are built on **exploiting a vulnerable workforce**. I can only hope that by lifting the curtain on what really goes on behind the scenes, players and parents alike will demand better treatment of customer support staff. **No company should endanger lives or condone modern-day "sweatshop" labor practices in the name of profits.** Children and workers deserve ethical business conduct from corporations entertaining them.
## In Summary
My time at Roblox opened my eyes to the harsh realities obscured by a popular gaming facade. While bringing joy to many, the company systematically **underpays, overworks and endangers the wellbeing** of those toiling unseen in its outsourced call centers. **Through speaking out, I aim to spark positive change - for the sake of both happy players and humane working conditions.** No person deserves the treatment I witnessed, and together perhaps we can encourage companies to "do better" for all.
