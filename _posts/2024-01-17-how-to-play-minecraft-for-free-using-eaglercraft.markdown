Eaglercraft is an amazing browser-based tool that allows players to experience Minecraft for free in their web browser. In this guide, we will explore how to get started with Eaglercraft and some additional features it offers compared to the normal Minecraft experience.
### Importing and Exporting Worlds
Eaglercraft makes it incredibly easy to transfer your worlds across devices. Worlds are stored locally in your browser's storage. You can export worlds as EPK files and import them on any Eaglercraft site to continue your adventures. This allows seamless transition between computers without needing external storage devices. You can also share worlds directly with friends by sending them the EPK file.
World files are generally pretty small thanks to Eaglercraft's optimized storage format. This means sharing your creations is a breeze regardless of available cloud storage or internet speeds. It truly captures the freedom and community aspect that makes Minecraft so special to play entirely in your web browser.

### Connecting Through LAN Worlds 
Eaglercraft fully supports creating **Local Area Network (LAN)** worlds that make multiplayer even easier. Simply open your world to LAN from the menu, and anyone connected to the same network can join instantly without server addresses. 
LAN worlds are not limited to just local networks either. As long as both players are online, you can use LAN to play together across great distances. It works similar to connecting direct to another player's server. LAN worlds are **peer-to-peer** so no third party hosting is required.
### Classic Minecraft Creative Mode
For those wanting a more [retro experience](https://store.fi.io.vn/cute-axolotl-funny-i-axolotl-questions-salamander-265/men&), the original Classic Minecraft mode from 2009 can still be played directly in your browser courtesy of Minecraft.net. While more basic than modern versions, it offers endless possibilities in its minimalistic pixelated world. Both young and old players alike can discover why this seminal game became so beloved.
### Custom Modding Support
While Eaglercraft aims to emulate Vanilla gameplay, the community has begun exploring modding possibilities within the browser constraints. Early experiments include mods that add new blocks, biomes, mobs and more. Over time, the library of available mods will only expand. If you enjoy customizing your game, keep an eye out for new browser-based modpacks.
### No Downloads or Installations Required  
The best part is you can start playing within seconds without any downloads. Eaglercraft runs directly in your browser using modern web technologies. All you need is a recent browser and internet connection. There's no software to install, updates to manage, or legacy browser compatibility issues to worry about. Simply load up Eaglercraft and get building right away.
