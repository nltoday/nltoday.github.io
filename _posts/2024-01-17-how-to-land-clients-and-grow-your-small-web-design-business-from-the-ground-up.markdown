### Going Door-to-Door to Find Clients 
Getting started is often the hardest part for any new small business. With web design, many entrepreneurs focus first on online marketing and advertising to find clients. However, there is still power in making **in-person connections** through networking and going directly to local businesses. Meeting potential clients face-to-face allows you to assess their needs, showcase samples of your work, and build trust and rapport that is harder to do online.
I advise any new web designer to spend dedicated time each week visiting local shops, restaurants, professionals offices and other **brick-and-mortar** enterprises in their community. Bring a laptop loaded with good examples of past website designs so you can do demonstrations right there. Having business cards and a well-organized binder of services and pricing makes a great first impression. Don't be afraid to introduce yourself to owners, managers or decision makers and briefly pitch what you offer and how it could help grow their business through an improved online presence. Many will be receptive to at least a follow up call or meeting later on.

### Leveraging Referrals from Friends and Family
Your personal network of friends, family members and acquaintances is another [untapped referral source](https://store.fi.io.vn/you-can-never-go-wrong-add-to-stories-a-dog-schnauzer-1) that should not be overlooked as a new business owner. Chances are some of the people you already know either run small companies themselves or interact with others who do. Make them aware of the types of websites, logos or print materials you design so they remember to recommend you if the need arises. As a way to thank referrals that lead to paid work, consider offering them a percentage of the project fees as a finder's fee. This incentive can help motivate your existing connections to keep you top of mind for referrals over time.
### Approaching Existing Businesses in Need of an Upgrade
While branding yourselves to new startups and solopreneurs is important, don't ignore the many established companies that may be primed for a website update or redesign as well. Even businesses that already have an online presence recognize the need to stay current with design trends and incorporate new technologies or features periodically. Scope out **local shops and organizations** you observe might benefit from a modernized website that improves user experience and helps them better market online. Confidently introduce your services and experience level when introducing in person at their brick and mortar location. Many owners will be open to a free consult even if not ready to commit yet.
### Turning Consultations into Signed Contracts  
Once you've connected with promising leads through the preceding outreach strategies, your goal is to smoothly transition informal conversations into paying client agreements. Here are some tips:
- During initial meetings, ask guided questions to better understand their goals, pain points and target audiences in order to propose well-matched solutions. 
- Give potential clients homework by providing design inspiration samples to ponder before the next meeting. 
- At follow ups, present tailored mockups and outlines of the work you'd perform at what estimated costs. 
- Address concerns diplomatically and offer payment plan or trial period options when budget is a factor.
- Remember that rapport matters - follow up consistently to build trust prior to asking for a signature on a contract.
With patience and professionalism, those initial informational meetings can blossom into long-term client wins that fuel the steady growth of your small web design agency.
### Staying Busy Through Ongoing Client Service 
While finding new projects is a priority, it's also important to maintain excellent support for existing clients to keep them satisfied long-term. Check in with clients periodically, and especially after launch, to ask how their sites are performing and whether any modifications or additions would be beneficial. Continue enhancing conversions and value for clients even after initial bills are paid. Implement feedback promptly and keep the lines of communication open. Going above and beyond with service ensures referrals and repeat business down the road. Additionally, revisit past clients periodically to suggest migration to a new content management system or website maintenance packages. Recurring services provide steady income streams. Treating each customer as a long term investment pays off for small agencies operating lean.
### Using Reviews and Case Studies to Attract More Work  
When delivering great results for clients, always politely request an online testimonial or case study you can use on your website and other marketing initiatives. Glowing third party endorsements play a huge role in building trust and social proof for prospective customers still on the fence. Highlighting measurable impacts like increased leads, sales or user satisfaction provide concrete examples of the value you deliver. Case studies demonstrating the ease of content management or analytics insights also benefit clients you may be trying to help migrate platforms. These forms of social proof go a long way when initial client meetings are not yet possible due to limited local community outreach efforts at the start. Focus on collecting many reviews to attract more inbound interest and leads for your agency at any stage.
