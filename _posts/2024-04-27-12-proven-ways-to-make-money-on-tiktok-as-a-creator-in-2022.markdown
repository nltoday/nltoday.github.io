The rising popularity of TikTok has opened up new opportunities for creators to monetize their work and build a business on the platform. While gaining a huge following takes time and effort, there are still viable ways for smaller accounts to earn income through their engaging content. Let's explore some of the top strategies.
### Monetizing Through the Creator Fund 
Launched in 2021, TikTok's Creator Fund has become one of the primary revenue streams for many video makers. To qualify, creators need at least **10,000 followers[ and a minimum of ](https://store.fi.io.vn/best-chihuahua-dad-ever-retro-vintage-sunset6832-t-shirt)100,000 video views** in the last 30 days. Payout is based on factors like views from authentic accounts and user location. While earning potential varies, many full-time TikTokers earn anywhere from several hundred to thousands per month. The Creator Fund allows creators to get paid directly by TikTok without needing brand sponsorships.

### Promoting Affiliate Products and Services
Creators with an engaged audience can promote affiliate products and services related to their niche. For example, a fitness influencer could share supplement brands or workout equipment through provided affiliate links. If followers make purchases using those links, the creator earns a commission. Popular niches for affiliate marketing on TikTok include fitness, parenting, beauty, tech, cooking and more. The key is providing value to the audience first before promoting products. 
### Live Streaming and Accepting Donations
Similar to live streaming platforms like Twitch, TikTok lets creators earn money directly from their viewers through "Live Gifts". Fans can purchase virtual gifts using coins and send them to live streamers in real-time as a way to donate and show their support. Live streams that are entertaining, interactive and offer unique experiences tend to earn the most donations on TikTok. The gifts can then be exchanged for real money through services like PayPal.
### Building a Branded Partnership Business
Creators with a sizable following of at least 50k-100k can reach out directly to brands for potential partnership opportunities. This may include sponsored posts, takeover content, product reviews, tutorial videos, contests and more. Rates will depend on the creator's engagement metrics and popularity within their niche. It's important for partnership creators to provide campaign reporting metrics to help brands measure performance. Professional management or agencies can help negotiate deals. 
### Selling Informational Courses and Online Classes
For creators with expertise in a certain topic, developing online courses teaching those skills can open up new monetization potential. Popular topics may include dance tutorials, coding lessons, craft classes, cooking videos and more. Courses can be hosted on separate websites or platforms like Thinkific and be promoted directly to existing TikTok followers. Initial investments will be needed to create high-quality course content and assets.
### Growing an Email List and Selling Digital Products 
While organic reach on TikTok can be unpredictable, building an opt-in email list allows creators to directly market to loyal fans outside the platform. Using strategies like offering a lead magnet in exchange for an email, creators can start growing their subscriber count over time. The list can then be used to promote and sell digital products creators create such as eBooks, presets, templates and more using services like Gumroad or Creative Market. Having multiple streams protects them from volatility on any single platform. 
### Monetizing YouTube via Video Transcriptions
Many top TikTok creators are now cross-promoting their content to YouTube to take advantage of its stable monetization through ads. One underutilized way to earn more is by creating high-quality YouTube transcripts for each video. Sites like Rev will pay creators per word to transcribe videos, providing an additional revenue stream. The transcripts also improve searchability and make videos more accessible. Creators should aim to transcribe at least the more popular videos on their channel.
### Starting a Podcast Related to Your Niche 
Podcasting has seen huge growth and offers creators a new format and distribution channel to build their personal brand. TikTok stars interested in the audio space can launch a podcast discussing topics relevant to their niche while still producing videos. Podcasts provide additional content to promote while diversifying income. Popular hosting platforms like Buzzsprout, Anchor and Apple Podcasts handle everything from hosting to distribution. Over time as the following grows, sponsorships and paid podcasts become possible revenue streams.  
### Selling Merchandise to Fans
For creators with a strong personal brand identity, designing and selling merchandise like t-shirts, mugs, hats and other accessories allows fans to proudly represent their favorite influencer. Sites like Teespring, Printful and Redbubble make it easy to upload designs and handle production/shipping. Creators receive ongoing royalties any time their merch sells. Physical items help deepen the connection between fans and their favorite personalities on TikTok in a tangible way.
### Partnering with Music Licensing Companies  
TikTok videos often feature popular songs that add great vibes to content. Some record labels are now actively working with top influencers to place songs through partnerships. Sites like Spotify For Artists, CD Baby and Soundstripe connect creators directly with rightsholders looking for placements. In exchange for free usage of tracks in videos, labels may provide an ongoing royalty percentage anytime those tracks are used. Licensing provides recurring revenue without overly worrying about copyright claims. It grows as the content reaches wider audiences over time. 
### Leveraging Other Social Platforms for Additional Revenue
While the initial following comes from TikTok, top influencers are now monetizing across multiple social networks with the same engagement strategies. Platforms like Instagram, YouTube, Twitch and more each offer unique monetization tools. A creator with an audience of 100k on TikTok may translate that into thousands of highly engaged monthly viewers on YouTube eligible for advertising revenue, for example. Proper cross-promotion grows total reach and diversifies income potential from different platforms over time.
### Selling Previously Owned Accounts 
Finally, the rising demand for purchasing pre-built social media accounts with engaged audiences opens up an untapped business opportunity for creators. Sites like RevPop and Queue allow influencers who've grown accounts organically to a large size then sell them, providing an immediate payout for their hard work. Buyers obtain a ready-made profile they can use for marketing, while sellers can deploy those funds into growing new profiles or launching additional branded campaigns. It remains a viable exit plan for those looking to eventually move on from individual accounts.
There are many innovative ways for creators of all sizes to earn income through TikTok if they focus on truly entertaining and engaging with their niche audience first before exploring monetization. With the right strategy tailored to one's strengths, the platform has huge potential for full-time entrepreneurship. Consistency, creativity and community-building remain key.
