Perception of time is a complex phenomenon that has perplexed human beings throughout history. While objective measures of time keep steady using clocks and calendars, our internal sense of the passage of time is highly subjective and variable. Several hypotheses have attempted to explain why time seems to speed up as we age, but the question remains profoundly mysterious. Through first-hand accounts and reflections on experiences across different stages of life, this paper examines how individual perception of time's flow is influenced by memory, emotion, attention and routine.
## Routine and Variety
Being employed in a **regular full-time job** often leads to a routine that makes years fly by unnoticed, as one week and month blend into the next without much variation. After losing his job and starting self-employment over a decade ago, the author notices this "flying by" feeling has lessened. Keeping life **active and varied** with new experiences and awareness of each present moment helps slow down subjective time and make more of the long-term potential in each life. Appreciating daily moments instead of dwelling in routine allows one to actually live more of the time given.
## Memory and Novelty  
The brain stores **denser memories** of novel events packed with more sensory details, making those times feel longer in retrospect. Once an experience becomes routine with little new input, the brain does not have to work as hard to form memories. Years filled with few novel activities thus feel like they passed faster with less to recollect. Children encounter constant new experiences, so their years feel longer, while the retired or idle elderly may perceive time's flow differently than those remaining engaged.
## Relationship to Milestones
Major life events that reshape identity or circumstances, like raising children or career changes, tend to heighten temporal awareness. One becomes strikingly conscious of time's rapid passage seeing a child develop over days into an independent adult. Nearing life's end, the very old and terminally ill may feel their allotted time is complete and want it to slow, in contrast to youthful impatience for milestones ahead.
## Emotion and Attention
How we appraise the past, present and future with positive or negative affect further influences our internal clock. Losing oneself fully in experiences of **focused present-moment awareness** or intense emotions also distorts temporal perception relative to periods of mind-wandering or waiting passively. Though time marches objectively, its quality within life follows an intricate dance with human factors of memory, meaning and mindset.
## A Muse for Reflection
The ever-changing flow of time has long invited contemplation. A live talk show host reflects on developing an intuitive sense of different temporal units through practice yet finding duration alter with circumstances. While theories explain aspects, time remains profoundly individual - speeding unexpectedly when life flows smoothly yet dragging in difficultvalleys. Its constant yet hidden movement stirs reflection on maximizing each moment and relishing dynamic change across our journey.
## Individual Tuning 
One date recounted years ago now seems ancient history while recent hard years feel a fleeting blur. Each person tunes their internal clock uniquely depending on what fills their perception at any point. Calendars divide years objectively but time exists concretely only within each living, changing mind. Its relating factors like routine, memory and emotion weave endlessly variable experiences of temporal flow even as its long-term arrow aims steadfast ahead. Time's ultimate mystery humbles our attempts to capture it yet sparks fruitful pondering.
## Treasuring the Time We're Given
With more life comes a longing for more time instead of other desires. Deeper bonds, discoveries and experiences become possible if only there were further moments to share. Though we can't slow time's current, being fully present amid joy or challenge offers reminders to cherish each day. Time marches on relentlessly toward our inevitable end yet within its river we can steer toward richness. Its constant yet obscured qualities make appreciating each transitory moment and transformative stage along our personal journey all the more worthwhile.
