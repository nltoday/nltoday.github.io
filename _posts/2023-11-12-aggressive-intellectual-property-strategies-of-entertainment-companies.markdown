### Copyrighting Common Terms and Ideas  
Games Workshop has aggressively pursued protecting common terms like "space marines" through trademark claims, even though the term predates their use of it. They went after authors for including the phrase in titles and plots. Critics argue the company is trying to monopolize ownership over ideas that originated elsewhere in science fiction.

### Altering Creative Works to Avoid Legal Battles
There is evidence that the backstory for StarCraft 2 was modified to exclude certain alien races and plotlines closely mirroring elements from Games Workshop's properties. The Overmind and Cerebrates were removed reportedly to appease the company and prevent potential legal issues. **game design changes due to IP claims** Blizzard and Games Workshop have also sparred over perceived similarities between their respective fantasy settings. 
### Attempting to Trademark Cultural Traditions
Disney faced a massive backlash when it tried to secure rights over the phrase "DÃ­a de los Muertos" or Day of the Dead in English. The holiday celebrates deceased loved ones as part of Mexican and Latin American cultural traditions. Critics saw the trademark request as cultural appropriation and branded Disney greedy for wanting ownership over an established cultural event. **corporate overreach anger ethnic groups** The company swiftly backed down after an online petition gained tens of thousands of signatures in protest.
### Aggressive Digital Copyright Enforcement 
Major record labels like Universal Music Group are notorious for issuing copyright claims against YouTube videos that include even a few seconds of unlicensed music. **music industry YouTube policing** Channels can be suspended or deleted if the same song appears repeatedly across their uploads. There have also been cases where labels claimed ownership over cover songs they do not control or public domain materials. Overly broad algorithms and vague copyright laws allow overpolicing of online content.
### Network Overzealousness 
Television networks closely guard their programming and intellectual property. Footage under two minutes risks copyright claims if used without permission online. News reporting may include a few short clips under fair use doctrine, but aggregating full episodes raises problems. **broadcasters limit program sharing** Networks are quick to issue takedown notices or block uploads of their properties, sometimes too broadly without considering fair use. Revenue concerns appear to drive aggressiveness more than reasonable copyright protection. 
### Broad Claims Over Character Images   
Individual celebrities, photographers and creative talent also police online usage of pictures through agents. Photos from red carpets or shoots attract routine copyright claims, including when used with commentary or news reporting. **personality image laws interpreted wide** Even iconic figures who vastly increased fame after their deaths get limited public use due to expansive rights assertions from their estates. While copyright aims to incentivize creation, some implementations may curb cultural discussion and non-commercial sharing.
### Balance Needed in IP Enforcement Online
With vast content at risk of unwarranted takedowns from overreaching copyright holders, more nuanced regulations and dispute mechanisms are required. **laws need fine tuning** While creativity deserves fair compensation, cultural exchange and commentary must also have room to thrive. Broad algorithmic filtering and aggressive legal threats discourage innovation if they curb permitted uses of content like criticism, parody and education under fair use. Interpretation of copyright laws requires balance.
