PUBG or PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is one of the most popular multiplayer battle royale games in the world. While the core gameplay is free, many additional in-game items like costumes, weapons skins etc. require purchasing premium content like the seasonal Royal Pass. Here are some legitimate ways to potentially get the Royal Pass without spending any money.
## Earn Bonus Points Through Challenges and Redeem for UC 
As mentioned in the input, PUBG does offer a way to earn [bonus points](https://yt.io.vn/collection/alfieri) through completing in-game challenges and missions. For example, achieving a **chicken dinner** (winning a match), getting kills, surviving longer etc. These bonus points can then be redeemed in the game for UC (PUBG coins). Currently, redeeming 1000 bonus points gives 100 UC, while 6000 points gives 600 UC. With 600 UC, you can purchase the basic Royal Pass version. So by regularly playing and achieving challenges over time, it is possible to stack up enough bonus points to get the Royal Pass without spending money. However, this will require dedicated regular gameplay over several weeks or months.
## Look Out For Discount Offers on Stores 
As pointed out, sometimes the mobile app stores like Google Play Store do offer temporary price discounts on purchases. Right now till April 12th 2019, there seems to be around 140 Indian Rupees off on purchases through some Google accounts. Keeping an eye out for such limited period deals could help players get the Royal Pass at a discounted price without paying the full amount. However, one needs to act fast during these windows to avail the offer. Players should also be careful about account security when using discounts.
## Beware of Unauthorized Methods and Risk of Account Ban
While some unauthorized third-party apps or websites claim they can provide free UC or the Royal Pass, players are strongly advised against using any such methods. As mentioned in the input, resorting to tricks or unauthorized channels does risk the main PUBG account getting permanently banned by the game developer. PUBG is very strict about use of only official payment and reward redemption methods. So any workaround carries a high risk of losing the account and all progress/purchases made so far. It is never recommended to compromise the main account.
### Participate in PUBG Tournaments and Events  
PUBG regularly hosts in-game tournaments and special events where players can participate and stand a chance to win different prizes. This includes UC, Royale Pass vouchers, outfits and more. Events like **PMSC (PUBG Mobile Star Challenge)** or **PMPL (PUBG Mobile Pro League)** offer great opportunities for skilled players. Even local tournaments hosted by various esports organizations provide a platform. With dedication to practice and perform well in tournaments consistently, it may be possible to earn enough prizes over time to get the seasonal Royal Pass for free. However, this requires a very high skill level.

### Check If Your Country Offers Free UC  
In some countries, PUBG runs promotional campaigns where new players can claim a certain amount of free UC just by downloading and completing simple tasks in the game. For example, in Thailand players recently got 600 UC (enough for a basic Royal Pass) completely free as part of a nationwide new user promotion campaign. Check official PUBG social media handles of your own country from time to time. You may come across such unique free UC opportunities specifically targeted at players in your region. However, the availability and amounts will vary greatly based on country/region. 
## Watch Videos and Complete Surveys for UC
There are certain third-party apps and websites which allow users to earn small amounts of UC by watching video ads or completing simple surveys. While the payout per task is very low (10-20 UC), stacking up over time through consistent use could yield enough to afford in-game items. However, users should be careful about privacy as some sites may collect personal data. It is also a tedious process with low earnings. So this should only be considered as a last resort if no other legitimate methods work out for a player wishing to get the Royal Pass without investing money upfront.
In conclusion, by putting in dedicated regular gameplay to earn bonus points, looking out for occasional store discounts, participating skillfully in tournaments and checking your local free UC promotions - it may be possible to eventually get the PUBG Royal Pass without direct cash spending. However, players must always stick to only official avenues and never resort to unauthorized tricks that risk account bans. Skill, patience and a little luck are key to earning rewards without paying in the long run.
