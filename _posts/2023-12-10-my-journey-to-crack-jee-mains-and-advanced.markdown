Growing up, I had always been interested in science and math. Though I started my JEE preparation late, through hard work and perseverance I was able to not only clear JEE Mains but also score well in JEE Advanced. Here is my story.
### Early Academic Years  
I was an above-average student throughout my schooling, scoring exceptionally well in class 10 board exams with 96.4%. I also did well in NTSE with 130 marks having put in minimal preparation. My interest and aptitude for math and science was clearly evident from a young age.

### Beginning JEE Preparation 
It was only in class 11 that I came to know about the prestigious IIT-JEE exam. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I could not join any coaching and had to prepare on my own. As a result, my performance started declining with low scores in final exams. I realized I needed proper guidance and resources to crack one of the toughest engineering entrance exams.
### Joining a Renowned Coaching Institute
In class 12, I joined a [renowned JEE coaching institute](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-boston-terrier-american-flag-usa-patriotic-dog-lover-v-neck-t-shirt/women&) in hopes of improving my preparation. However, the teaching methodology left a lot to be desired with more focus on completing the syllabus instead of actual learning. My test scores remained average. I knew I had to find alternative methods to effectively learn and gain conceptual clarity.
### Self-Study and YouTube Resources 
Seeing limited benefits from classroom learning, I stopped attending coaching classes after the syllabus was over and began self-studying using YouTube lecture videos. This marked a turning point as I was now in control of my own learning pace. I steadily improved and started scoring upwards of 100 marks in mock tests for the first time through consistent practice of previous year questions and formula revision.
### First Attempt at JEE Mains  
The sudden announcement of JEE Mains session 1 in January came as a surprise. Despite lack of adequate time, I gave my best and was pleasantly surprised to score over 100 marks, crossing the 94 percentile mark. This boost in confidence motivated me to work harder for the April attempt.
### Balancing Boards and Second Mains Attempt
After the January exam, I focused on nailing my board exams which formed a major criteria for admissions while still devoting time to JEE preparation. Through rigorous practice of 8-10 hours daily, I was able to improve further scoring over 150 marks in the April session with a percentile jump to 98.  
### Targeting JEE Advanced
Elated by my performance in Mains, I set my eyes on cracking **JEE Advanced**. Over the next few months leading up to the exam in August, I practiced Advanced level questions diligently and revised all my concepts thoroughly.
### Cracking JEE Advanced  
All the hardwork paid off as I was able to secure a rank within the top 10000 in JEE Advanced 2023, fulfilling my dream of making it to one of the prestigious IITs. Though it was a long journey with ups and downs, perseverance and self-belief helped me achieve my goals.
My story is a testament to the fact that with focused effort and dedication one can overcome initial limitations to accomplish great things. I hope it inspires others facing similar challenges in their own preparation. My journey has just begun and I look forward to making the most of the opportunities that lie ahead at IIT.
