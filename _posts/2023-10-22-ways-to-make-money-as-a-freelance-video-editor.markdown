Be sure to include high-quality sample work across various genres, along with clear service offerings, pricing guidelines, and ways to get in touch. 
Another piece of your online presence to focus on is your social media profiles, especially on platforms like YouTube, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn where you can share behind-the-scenes looks at your editing process and published works. These help prove your expertise while also networking you with individuals and businesses in need of video services.
