### [Missing DLL Files and Game Errors](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-but-psycho-bae-darling-crazy-girlfriend-t-shirt/men&)
While playing your favorite games on your Windows PC, you may encounter errors suggesting missing DLL files. DLL or Dynamic Link Library files are crucial components of the Windows operating system that allow programs and applications to run smoothly. When a needed DLL file is missing, it can cause games or other programs to crash or have issues. 
In this case, the error message references a missing "Isdone.dll" file.  Isdone.dll provides important information to the PC about tasks needed to run games properly. Without it, games will not function as intended. This is a common problem when playing graphics-intensive games that require more system resources. 
Rather than downloading random DLL files from untrusted sources online, the safest approach is to first attempt reinstalling or repairing the game installation. This can replace any missing or corrupted files. If the problem persists, it may indicate a deeper issue requiring additional troubleshooting.

### **Repairing and Reinstalling Games** 
To address the missing DLL file error, the first recommended step is to uninstall and reinstall the affected game. Completely removing then reinstalling often fixes software problems by replacing any broken or corrupted files. 
To uninstall a game on Windows:
- Open the "Add or Remove Programs" section in the control panel.
- Find the game's name in the list of installed programs. 
- Select it and click "Uninstall" or "Remove."
- Follow any on-screen instructions to fully uninstall the game and its components.
- Once uninstalled, restart your computer.
- Reinstall the game by running its setup file again from the beginning.
If reinstalling does not resolve the missing DLL error, it may be an issue with other system files instead of the game itself. Further troubleshooting would then be required.
### **Replacing Individual Missing DLL Files**
If a game error clearly identifies a specific missing DLL file like Isdone.dll, it may be possible to replace just that single file rather than fully reinstalling the entire game. However, this approach requires caution.
The safest method is to obtain the correct DLL file from the game publisher or software developer directly rather than downloading random files online. Contact their support team for assistance identifying and acquiring the proper DLL replacement. 
To replace a DLL file:
- Save the replacement DLL to the Windows System32 folder or the game's install directory.
- Rename any existing file with the same name, like "Isdone.dll" to "Isdone.dll.bak" as a backup.  
- Rename the new DLL file to the original file name, like "Isdone.dll".
- Run "regsvr32 Isdone.dll" in Command Prompt to register the new DLL with the system.
- Try running the game again and check if the error is resolved.
While replacing individual DLL files can work, it's generally not recommended as downloaded files carry malware risks. Uninstalling/reinstalling is the safer first approach.
### **Issues Within the Windows Registry**
In some cases, missing or corrupt DLL file errors may be caused by deeper problems within the Windows Registry database. The Registry contains vital system settings and information needed by applications, drivers, and games to function properly. 
If Registry entries associated with a game or DLL file have been deleted, corrupted, or are referencing the wrong file paths, it can prevent the DLL from loading as intended. This leads to errors like the one being experienced.
To check the Registry for potential issues:
- Open the Registry Editor by running "RegEdit.exe".  
- Browse to keys like HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, HKEY_CURRENT_USER, and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE looking for the game name or DLL references.
- Check data values and ensure they point to the correct installed files and locations.
- Search for any corrupt or empty entries associated with the game or DLL file.
Fixing incorrect Registry entries may solve DLL errors in some cases. But modifying the Registry is risky if not done properly. Consult online help or game support for exact key locations and value fixes. Backups are strongly advised before editing.
### **Hardware Issues Impacting Game Performance**
Rarely, missing or corrupt DLL errors may be symptomatic of deeper hardware problems degrading a PC's ability to run graphics-intensive games. Components like graphics cards, processors, and memory can cause instability over time.
To check for potential hardware issues:
- Run diagnostics on graphics card, CPU, RAM, and storage devices for errors, firmware updates or driver issues
- Check temperatures and fan speeds - Overheating can destabilize systems over long periods
- Update BIOS/firmware to latest versions for hardware compatibility fixes
- Dust out heatsinks and fans to allow for proper cooling 
- Boost minimum system requirements by upgrading older components as budgets allow
While hardware issues don't necessarily cause specific DLL errors, resolving them can improve gaming performance and stability to avoid crashes from pushing aging systems too far. Upgrades may finally fix problematic games.
### **When to Contact Game Support for Assistance**
If multiple troubleshooting steps have been unsuccessfully tried, including complete reinstalls, replacing DLLs from authorized sources, checking Windows Registry, and ruling out hardware issues, it may be time to contact the game developer or publisher support team directly. 
They have extensive product knowledge and internal tools to further diagnose complicated problems. Support staff can:
- Analyze detailed system information and error logs  
- Recommend customized troubleshooting instructions
- Check for known bugs or incompatibilities
- Provide official fixes, patches or workarounds if available
- Escalate serious issues to internal development teams
While it's usually best to try self-help first, game companies want customers playing without frustrations. Their technical experts may uncover solutions missed otherwise. Don't hesitate to ask when exhausting all recommended remedies.
So in summary, when encountering unexpected game errors, thoroughly troubleshoot software, operating system, hardware and contact support as a last resort. Following these steps systematically will usually identify and fix the root problem allowing games to run smoothly again as intended.
