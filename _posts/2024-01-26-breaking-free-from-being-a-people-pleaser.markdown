## The Mindset of a People Pleaser
So many of us have experienced feeling resentful after sacrificing our own values and beliefs just to please others and get their approval. We end up blaming other people when deep down, we resent having to compromise who we truly are. The core issue is that people pleasers operate from a misguided belief that people will like and approve of us based on what we do for them, rather than simply accepting us for who we are. Over time, this people-pleasing behavior becomes toxic as it chips away at our sense of self. 
### Approval Addiction and the Fear of Disapproval
At the root of people-pleasing is an unhealthy addiction to gaining approval and a crippling fear of disapproval or conflict. We sacrifice important things like speaking our truth, setting boundaries, or doing what truly makes us happy just to avoid even the possibility that someone might disapprove of us or engage us in conflict.  This stems from a lack of self-approval - we don't truly love or respect ourselves enough to be okay with potentially upsetting others. So we people-please to fill that void of self-worth.

## The Cycle of Unhappiness for People Pleasers
There is a predictable three step cycle that people pleasers get stuck in:
### 1. Sacrificing Yourself for Others' Approval 
The cycle begins when we put someone else's desires, needs or opinions above our own in order to earn their approval. We compromise on values or beliefs we hold dear just to make sure others like us.
### 2. Feeling Resentment Build Up
Over time, sacrificing who we are builds up deep inner resentment. We feel unheard, disrespected and taken for granted by the very people we are trying so hard to please. 
### 3. Blaming Others for Our Unhappiness  
To protect our fragile self-esteem, we place the blame for our discontent on others instead of recognizing our role in people-pleasing behaviors that make us miserable.
## Breaking Free from People Pleasing
The key to breaking this cycle is gaining the courage and **self-awareness** to start fully accepting and approving of ourselves, just as we are, without needing anyone else's validation. Here are some steps to help shift out of a people-pleasing mindset:
### Understanding You Don't Need Anyone's Approval 
Realize that you have inherent worth wholly separate from whether others approve of you or not. You have the power to define your own purpose and live authentically without compromising yourself.
### Approving of Yourself 
Make a committed daily practice to build up **self-respect**, show yourself compassion, validate your own feelings and needs above all others. Learn to love yourself unconditionally.
### Setting Healthy Boundaries
Have the courage to speak your truth and establish boundaries around your values, needs and time. Be willing to say "no" politely when compromising would make you resentful.  
### Taking Responsibility for Your Feelings
Recognize that you alone are responsible for your own happiness. Stop blaming others and make active choices each day to fulfill rather than resent yourself. 
### Choosing Self-Respect over People-Pleasing  
When the urge to people-please arises, pause and check in with your integrity. Will compromising bring you closer to self-respect, or breed more resentment? Choose the path of self-love.
## Overcoming Approval Addiction through Self-Awareness
True freedom from people-pleasing lies in evolving your self-awareness. As you make daily strides in approving of yourself fully as-is, fears of disapproval start to fade. Confidence in your inherent worth grows stronger than any addiction to external validation. The process takes time, but with commitment to self-care, you develop a greater capacity to:
### Respect Your Own Needs Equally
Value your needs, desires and boundaries just as much as those around you. Seek fulfillment through integrity rather than resignation.  
### Tolerate Disapproval with Equanimity  
Be at peace knowing you cannot control how others think or feel, nor should you define your self-worth by it. Outside opinions have lost power over your well-being.
### Make Choices from a Place of Self-Love
From a place of empowerment rather than scarcity, interact with others from a position of strength, navigating relationships with care, compassion - and **self-respect** above all else.
## Living Fully as Your Authentic Self
Ultimately, the reward of gaining independence from people-pleasing is regaining a vital connection with your authentic self. With self-approval as your foundation, you can express your unique perspective and bring your full, truthful presence to relationships and to the world. Rather than resenting others or feeling resented, you experience the profound fulfillment of living fully and freely as who you truly are.
