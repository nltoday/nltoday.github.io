Teenagers today have more opportunities than ever before to make money online thanks to the internet. Here are 15 top ideas for how you can earn an income as a teen without needing special skills or experience.
## Sell Your Artwork and Designs
Making and selling your own artwork or designs is a great way for creatively-minded teens to earn money. Whether you enjoy drawing, painting, photography, or graphic design, there are online marketplaces where you can sell original pieces or custom commissions. Websites like [Etsy for handmade art](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/abril) or **print on demand sites** like Redbubble allow artists of any age to display and market their work to a global audience for a small commission on each sale. With some practice and experimentation finding your style, you could earn a nice side income from your creative talents.
### Marketing Your Art on Social Media 
In this digital age, having an active presence on social media platforms is key for any artist or creator looking to promote and sell their work. Spend time each week posting new pieces to your profiles on sites like **Instagram for visual artists**, Facebook, or Twitter and engaging with your followers. Include relevant hashtags, boost high-quality posts to gain more exposure, and don't be afraid to politely ask people to share your page with their friends and networks. Well-marketed art pages can translate into a steady stream of commissions and sales over time.

### Offering Custom Requests and Tutorials
Another way to monetize your art online is by offering custom piece requests where buyers can specify details like size, medium, or subject matter they want created. You can also teach your craft by providing **video tutorials on websites** focused on art like YouTube or skillshare and earning money from the ad revenue or paid memberships. Showing the process and sharing tips is a fun way for artists to connect with an audience and make money from their talents.
## Becoming a Freelance Web Designer  
If you have a knack for code and are interested in all things tech and design, web design is a flexible field that allows teenagers to put those skills to use. Learn HTML, CSS and basic web development languages either online through free courses or at a local high school/college. Then promote your services as a freelance designer through sites like **Upwork for freelance jobs** or by directly contacting small businesses. You can offer logo packages, web page creation, maintenance and more to start building a portfolio and client list and get paid decent wages even as a teenager just starting out.
### Starting a Blog to Demonstrate Skills
The best way to convince potential clients that you know what you're doing is by having real examples to show off. Launch your own personal blog or business site to practice your designing and coding abilities. Fill it with interesting **content related to your niche** and make sure the site looks polished and professional. Include case studies of mock clients you created sites for. Having this live portfolio of work available for clients to check out bolsters your credibility and gives them confidence to hire you for paid projects.
### Offering Additional Services Like SEO 
Once you've built a few website designs for clients, think of other closely related digital services you can offer under the same brand to expand your business. Search engine optimization is a big one, as many small companies want help improving their online presence but don't know where to start. Providing SEO audits and ongoing optimization can be a recurring income stream. You could also teach clients about social media marketing, logo creation, email marketing or other digital areas that complement design work nicely.
## Selling Your Own Photography 
If photography is your creative passion, take photos of whatever inspires you - landscapes, portraits, events - and upload your best shots to sell online. Again, sites like **Etsy and specialized photo marketplaces** let photographers of any experience level sell prints and digital downloads. Consider offering photography services too like senior portraits, family photoshoots, product photography for small businesses - and watermarking a web address across your pictures helps drive traffic back to see more of your work for sale. With practice and experimentation finding your photographic style, you could earn thousands per year with photography by the time you graduate high school. 
### Creating Photography Presets & Actions
Beyond just selling individual photos, another popular way for photographers to earn online is by creating and distributing photo editing presets and actions. Presets are image filter effects you can apply with one click to achieve a desired look, like warming tones or adding dramatic contrast. Actions are multi-step editing sequences that automate common adjustment tasks. Package presets and actions relevant to your photography niche and sell them as low-cost downloadable products on your site or marketplaces like **Etsy that allow digital goods**. Even cheap presets at $5-10 each can add up to significant income over time. 
### Offering Photography Instruction
Photographers should also consider offering instruction to others wanting to learn and improve their skills. Create step-by-step video tutorials and courses teaching topics from camera settings, to posing models, post-production techniques and more. Platforms like **YouTube and Udemy are perfectly suited for online classes** and courses. Monetize your channel or courses through advertising revenue share and subscriptions. Teaching what you've learned through your own photography journey is engaging for students and a passive way to earn from your expertise.
## Providing Online Tutoring  
If you naturally explain concepts well and enjoy helping others learn, online tutoring lets you flex those teaching muscles from home. Websites like **VIPKid connect tutors globally with students** wanting help in subjects from English and math to test prep like the SAT. Create a polished profile emphasizing your qualifications, and you could earn $15-25 per hour to skype one-on-one tutoring sessions around your schedule. Other sites connect local tutors with families too. Tutoring experience is ideal for any college application and allows students to make money from something fun and rewarding like helping others.
### Tutoring On Specialized Platforms
Beyond general subjects, consider tutoring for specialized skills and qualifications. If you're gifted in an art form like music, foreign language mastery, or computer programming, create an ad on sites geared towards those niches and charge premium rates. For instance, online language exchange partners sites allow you to tutor another student their target language while learning one of theirs for mutual benefit. And coding mentorship sites provide guidance to those learning to code from the ground up. Monetizing specialized skills opens extra potential income streams outside basic tutoring sites. 
### Offering Private Social Media Coaching
Many people want to grow their platforms and brands on sites like Instagram, YouTube, Facebook and TikTok but don't know where to start or how to do it effectively. Leverage your social media skills and experience by advertising one-on-one coaching services where you help individuals and small businesses achieve their goals. Analyze their accounts, recommend content strategies, teach necessary hashtags, comment podding and collaborative tactics. Packages can include weekly check-ins and ongoing support paid monthly. Social media strategy is lucrative thanks to its ability to tangibly grow audiences and sales for clients.
## Selling Online Courses or E-Books
If you have a lot of knowledge in a specific subject, consider packaging it into an online course or ebook for others to access as self-paced learning. Common profitable course topics are artistic skills like graphic design or coding languages; "how to start" guides for specific careers or businesses; study aids and test prep materials. Sell your digital products independently through your website or via platforms like **Udemy and Teachable** where high-quality content can earn thousands per month in royalties. You keep a majority of each sale and have lifetime sales without much ongoing work.
### Writing Tutorials and Step-By-Step Guides
Complement longer form courses by writing free and paid tutorials, guides and "how to" articles geared around what you teach. Share them on your blog and sites like **Medium focused on educational articles**. Monetize high-quality pieces through advertising or by offering "pro" memberships for access to an entire library of step-by-step guides on related subjects. With good SEO optimization and a backlog of evergreen content, the traffic can snowball over time into passive website income. Articles are an ideal lead generator funneling readers towards paid courses and products too. 
### Becoming an Affiliate Marketer
If you enjoy recommending products and services, affiliate marketing lets you earn commissions by promoting items from companies like Amazon, Walmart, eBay and more. Whether drawing attention to tools or materials relevant to your niche audience or promoting relevant books, simply include tracked affiliate links in your online content and anytime someone purchases through your referral link, you receive a percentage commission - usually around 5-10% of the sale value. With time and effort building up a following across multiple sites and platforms, affiliate income potential is high.
## Starting a Personal Brand on YouTube 
These days, building a following and lucrative career on YouTube is a fully legitimate endeavor. Find your niche whether it's gaming commentary, comedy sketches, vlogs about your life and hobbies or tutorial channels about your areas of passion or expertise. Consistently creating high-quality, shareworthy videos on a schedule and optimizing for metadata tags, titles and descriptions is key to gaining subscribers and views over time. Monetization options for successful YouTube channels include ad revenue shares, paidchannel sponsorships, merchandising your brand and even opportunities like paid public speaking based on your online fame. With persistence and original compelling content, your channel could become your full-time role
