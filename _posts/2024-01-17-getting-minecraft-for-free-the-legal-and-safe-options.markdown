### Legitimate Trial Version
One legitimate option to try out Minecraft without paying is using the official trial version directly from the Minecraft website. This trial version allows you to freely explore and play in a limited demo world for a certain period of time, usually around an hour or two, without any restrictions. While the trial version won't let you access the full game or create your own worlds, it's a safe and legal way to get a taste of Minecraft for free before deciding to purchase.

### Older Legacy Versions
It is possible to access and play older legacy versions of Minecraft that predate the strict demo implementations through direct downloads. These older versions from 2012-2013 essentially functioned as free demos that had the full gameplay unlocked without time limits. However, finding download links for verified legacy versions may require some digging. And keep in mind that these old versions will be missing many modern game features, updates, and performance optimizations.
### Surveys and Offers for In-Game Currency  
Some survey and offer websites like [Cash for Apps](https://store.fi.io.vn/funny-xmas-this-is-my-christmas-pajama-heartbeat-video-game-98/men&) allow users to complete simple tasks like surveys, app installations, or video views to earn small amounts of virtual currency over time. This currency can then be redeemed for prizes or services, including gift cards for purchasing Minecraft. While a slow and tedious process, it's a legitimate option for those willing to invest time and effort into earning Minecraft without an upfront cost. Just make sure to only use trusted offer wall providers to avoid scams.
### Borrow from a Friend or Library    
Another safe approach is to borrow the game from a friend who already owns it, or check if your local library has the PC version available to borrow like a physical book. Many libraries nowadays have expanded collections to include access to digital games and software. Borrowing allows you to experience the full Minecraft experience temporarily without needing to purchase it right away. Just be sure to respect any time limits on the borrowed copy.
### Sales, Bundles, and Promotions
Mojang and retailers regularly run sales, bundles, and promotions that significantly mark down the price of Minecraft and its various editions. Signing up for Minecraft and retailer newsletters is a good way to be alerted of upcoming deals. During major events like holidays, some bundles have been known to make the effective Minecraft cost as low as a few dollars or less. So keeping an eye out for discounts can help get the game at a more affordable pricepoint.
### Consider Alternatives Like Creative Mode Mods  
For those simply looking to freely explore and build creations without worrying about survival aspects, free alternative mods like **Creative Mode Mod** exist and can provide a Minecraft-like experience at no cost. While not a complete substitute for the full paid game, they allow satisfying some creative itches without needing to invest in Minecraft itself. But for the fullest official experience, eventually supporting the developers through purchase is preferable over long-term piracy or illegal options.
