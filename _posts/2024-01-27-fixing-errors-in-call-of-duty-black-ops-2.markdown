### Ensuring the Correct Timezone and Date
The first step is to ensure your date, time and timezone settings are configured properly in your system. Go to your date and time settings and change the timezone to **"+8:00 Beijing"**, then change the date to **"22/11/2012"[ and time to ](https://store.fi.io.vn/french-bulldog-frenchie-dog-black-dog-lover-frenchies-1)"1:27 AM"**. Setting the correct timezone and date helps avoid potential errors.

### Disconnecting from the Internet
Once you have configured the correct date and time, the next step is to disconnect your system from the internet. Go to your network settings and switch off your internet connection. **Disconnecting prevents issues caused by mismatches between your local system time and online servers**. 
### Installing Visual C++ Redistributables
One common error encountered is related to missing or outdated Visual C++ libraries. To fix this, navigate to the game folder and locate the **"redist"** folder, which contains the required redistributables. Run the **"vcredist_x86.exe"** file inside this folder to install the latest Visual C++ libraries. Installing the correct Visual C++ version helps resolve library-related errors.
### Updating DirectX Libraries
In addition to Visual C++, the DirectX libraries also need to be up-to-date. Navigate to the **"redist/DirectX"** folder inside the game directory and run **"DXSETUP.exe"** to install any required DirectX updates. Outdated DirectX can cause issues like crashes or corrupted graphics. Ensuring you have the latest DirectX version is important.
### Verifying Game Cache Files
Launch Steam and right-click on Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 inside your library. Go to Properties > Local Files and select **"verify integrity of game cache"**. Let the verification process complete - it may download some missing or corrupted files. Verifying the game files helps fix issues caused by corrupt or missing content. 
### Running as Administrator
Even after the above steps, if you still encounter errors, try running the game as Administrator by right-clicking the executable and selecting compatibility options. Set it to **"Run this program as an administrator"**. **Running as Administrator overrides permissions issues** that could be blocking the game from launching properly.
### Installing Skidrow Updates 
For pirated copies, another user recommended downloading and installing any available **Skidrow updates** for the game. Skidrow is a well-known game cracking group that releases patches and fixes. Their updates often contain fixes for common errors seen in pirated copies. **Installing the latest Skidrow update ensures your pirated game is running the most up-to-date code**.
In summary, the key steps to fixing errors in Call of Duty Black Ops 2 involve ensuring correct system timezone and date settings, updating Windows libraries like Visual C++ and DirectX, verifying game files, and applying any relevant patches or updates. Following these steps should resolve the most common error scenarios for both legitimate and pirated copies. Let me know if any of these fixes are able to get your game running smoothly!
