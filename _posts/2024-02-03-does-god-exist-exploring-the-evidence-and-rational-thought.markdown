### Looking for Proof 
Many people believe in God without strong evidence of God's existence. When asked for proof, they may point to holy books, traditions, or personal experiences as evidence. However, critics argue these are not solid proof and can be explained through other means like human imagination or social conditioning. **Those who do not believe in God's existence argue that lack of proof is sufficient reason to not assume God's existence until proven.** Both sides make valid philosophical points about what constitutes evidence and who bears the burden of proof.

### Multiple Religions Point to Lack of Certainty
If there truly was an all-powerful God, it seems unlikely there would be so many divergent religions across space and time preaching different messages and doctrines. **One would expect a single consistent religion globally if God directly revealed the "truth" to humanity.** Instead, we find native tribes centuries ago worshipping nature as God, ancient Egyptians worshipping animal gods, and modern religions all claiming to know God but disagreeing on core beliefs. This diversity of opinion throughout history suggests **God's existence and will are far from obviously clear based on available "evidence."**
### Where are the Modern Miracles?  
Ancient texts describe miracles performed by prophets and Gods to prove supernatural power and revelation. However, in today's world with near universal literacy and technology to record and verify claims, **no miracles are observed of the same magnitude as splitting seas or raising the dead.** If God wanted undeniable proof of existence, producing consistent miracles on par with historical claims today would seem necessary to convince a scientific and skeptical modern population. Lack of contemporary miracles observed by all casts doubt on historical miracle reports as well.
### Logical Inconsistencies in Scripture
Much of what's described in holy books has been proven false by scientific discovery, like **claims the earth is flat or at the center of the universe.** Additionally, the concept of an all-knowing, all-powerful God presents logical problems like determining **who created God and why God would allow suffering if able to prevent it.** Rather than answering deep questions, scripture often presents its mythology as fact without evidence while contradicting itself and basic observable reality. This raises doubts about reliability of such texts as proof of higher truths.  
### Atheism as the Default Position  
In the absence of compelling proof either way, **atheism or non-belief could logically be considered the default position** rather than affirmative belief in God concepts. One is not born already believing in any specific God - **these concepts must be learned through social and environmental factors after birth.** Considering alternative explanations for life's deep questions remains reasonable until conclusive evidence settles the debate one way or another. Individuals should not have to disprove God to justify **lack of theological commitment in the face of interpretive space for doubt.**
### Fear and Superstition as Factors in Belief
Before scientific understanding of natural phenomena, early humans understandably turned to storytelling and theism to explain various mysteries. [Fear of death and desire for control or meaning likely drove popularity of religious or supernatural explanations over unknowns](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-girl-who-loves-scotties-scottish-terrier-dog-breed-owner-1). While fulfilling psychological needs, this risked cementing **factually incorrect myths as revealed truths discouraging skepticism.** Even today, stories told in childhood can implant residue of supernaturalism difficult to fully escap, unconsciously influencing one's worldview. However, mature inspection finds most ancient mythologies lacking as objective models of reality.  
### Conclusion: An Open and Evolving Discussion
Reasonable perspectives exist on both sides of this debate, with complexity regarding what constitutes evidence or its subjective interpretation. Ultimately, absolute certainty may elude us. However, an honest, thoughtful discussion of **logic, facts and human nature** can still help separate truth from illusion to the best of our fallible judgment. **Both atheism and theism remain open to revision as understanding progresses.** Rather than accusations, all discussion participants would do well emphasizing tested ideas, clearly explained rationales and respect for divergent viewpoints in this profound and ever-evolving inquiry.
