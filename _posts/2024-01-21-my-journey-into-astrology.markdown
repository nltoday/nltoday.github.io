Astrology has always fascinated me. Growing up in a Hindu Brahmin family, I was exposed to astrology from a young age through my grandfather and his siblings. While they practiced it as a hobby, my parents saw it more as superstition. This mixed exposure led me on a personal journey to understand astrology and its true nature. 
## Early Interest and Education 
Though my parents didn't encourage me toward astrology, the predictions from my grandfather and his siblings piqued my curiosity. I studied well in school, achieving top marks until 12th grade. I then pursued a B.Tech in [Electronics and Communications Engineering](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-sunflower-chihuahua-mom-mothers-day-dog-mom-women-1-chihuahua-dog), hoping for a successful career in the growing technology field. However, during my engineering studies, I began experiencing failures for the first time. Struggling to understand course concepts, coupled with a family tragedy, led to depression. I barely passed with a low percentage, shattering my confidence. 
### Failed Career Attempts
After graduating with poor marks, doors closed at software companies and as a college lecturer due to disqualification. No matter what exams I attempted - from government jobs to banking - success eluded me. Just when an arranged interview gave hope, bad timing caused me to miss the opportunity. I constantly searched for what career path was truly meant for me.

## Turning to Astrology 
In desperation, my mom consulted an astrologer. He accurately predicted I was not destined for government work and advised pursuing astrology instead. In 2009, I accepted this career change, immersing myself in learning **Vedic astrology**. Initial predictions saw success, raising hopes. But over time, failures also occurred, leaving me doubting the method and my own abilities. 
### Ongoing Study and Refinement
Seeking more accurate techniques, I studied KP astrology, palmistry, numerology, vastu and more. While some cases succeeded, around 50% failed, frustrating my quest for truth. Large expenses on many courses yielded no satisfaction. Though respected publicly, I feared future perceptions as a 'cheater' if unable to consistently predict. Deep depression almost made me quit.
## The Breakthrough
Just when I wanted to give up, destiny intervened. I was blessed to meet renowned astrologer Dr. G.K. Adith Kasinath, inventor of the **EPS astrological system**. Through EPS, all questions tormenting my mind finally found answers. I understood why predictions succeeded or failed - it was due to incorrect birth times and improper methodologies used. EPS satisfied me scientifically and increased success rates. 
### Achieving Expertise
Now with the right approach and constant self-correction, I'm perfecting my skills as a **scientific astrologer**. Even my proud parents and guru introduce me this way. My journey's hardships positively shaped my dedication to accurately understanding astrology's true nature. Though a long road, perseverance led me to expertise throughscientific refinement.
## Guiding Others Correctly
Armed with EPS insights, I aim giving precise, helpful guidance. Many initially come due to past failures elsewhere, sceptical astrology can truly benefit. By carefully taking birth details and running advanced EPS analysis, I prove astrology's potent yet subtle effects. Clients leave empowered, appreciating clarity on past-present-future influences aiding decision-making. 
### A Responsible Practice
Never do I make unfounded predictions or raise unrealistic expectations. Guided by science, ethics is paramount - clients must understand free will outweighs destiny. While suggesting prudent options, the onus remains on applying guidance prudently themselves. My mission is equipping people to live harmoniously as per their **dharma and aptitudes**. Through patience and proof by accurate results over time, more accept astrology's true ability when properly understood and implemented.
## Spreading Scientific Awareness 
To expand astrology's positive impact, scientific awareness must rise. Misconceptions still see it coloured by irrationality instead of intricately correlated facts. I strive publishing research simplifying astrology's complex mechanisms for modern minds. Lectures emphasise vetting accuracy before accepting any system. Technology now facilitates verifying transits from any location too.
### Educating the Next Generation 
Especially critical is nurturing interest in the next generation. Through workshops and my YouTube channel, I make astrology engaging and accessible to youth. Simple, relatable examples illustrate its relevance to their life goals, relationships and careers. Positive reinforcement replaces past experiences of feeling writing it off. With growing Scientific expertise, our culture's insightful wisdom can rightly inspire and guide people globally, as the Vedas intended.
## Fulfilling my Dharma  
Reflecting on my journey's twists and turns, I see how each led me to perfectly fulfilling my dharma. Failures sculpted perseverance, opening astrology's doors when all else shut. Though a struggle, the destination was worth the effort. After years of self-refinement, clients and guruji affirm my success. Most satisfying is educating more to appreciate astrology scientifically, not discard it without understanding. This work nourishes my spirit completely.
