### Setting High Expectations  
Royal Global University promised world-class infrastructure and facilities based on the reputation of its sister institutions. The [modern campus facilities](https://yt.io.vn/collection/abbate) and **air-conditioned hostels** created an image of a high-tech university equipped with all amenities. Students were drawn to its claims of **inviting renowned guest speakers** and **focusing on quality education**. However, appearances can be deceiving as one student would come to find out.

### Rigid Schedule Leaves No Flexibility
Upon arriving for the first semester, students discovered a highly **structured daily schedule** that left little room for rest or independent study. Classes were scheduled from 9am to 5pm with lengthy breaks in between, yet students were **required to remain on campus**. Attempts to quietly study in hostels during breaks were thwarted by strict monitoring. The long hours sitting idle each day soon took a **toll on students' mental wellbeing and productivity**. 
### Hostel Rules Treat Students Like Children 
The **gender-biased curfew rules** in girls' hostels were especially demoralizing. Basic freedoms like going out for lunch were barred under the guise of **protecting cultural values**. When one student dared to discreetly enjoy non-vegetarian food off-campus, she was publicly scolded by security. The **humiliating confrontation** left her feeling punished rather than respected as a paying student.
### Sacrificing Student Needs for Publicity Stunts  
During festivals, students faced further hardship when administration **evicted them from rooms** for two weeks to accommodate guests. Pleas for **flexible accommodation** fell on deaf ears. The **money-minded** vice-chancellor callously dismissed students' exam preparations, prioritizing image over welfare. His **self-serving attitude** became increasingly clear.
### Subpar Education Despite High Fees
While infrastructure may have seemed **impressive on paper**, the quality of teaching did not match advertised standards. **Inexperienced lecturers** struggled to engage students, and **did not last long** under the stressful management. Scarce holidays made it difficult to recharge between **grueling examination cycles**. Students questioned whether exorbitant tuition **justified such mediocre education.**
### Forced Involvement Betrays Inner Workings  
Even festivals meant for enjoyment became **chores under obligation**. Mandatory attendance-taking at events betrayed the **commercial rather than communal spirit** of the administration. Students saw through fa√ßades of caring for their holistic growth, realizing the university's **true priority was profit above all else**. 
### An Unworthy Experience Best Avoided
In concluding, this student strongly advises others to **reconsider Royal Global University**. While infrastructure may impress, the **toxic culture** of rigid control, neglecting welfare, and **prioritizing money over morals** make it an unsuitable choice. Prospective students deserve honest transparency on inner workings shaping their university experience, to make informed choices on where best to invest their time and tuition.
