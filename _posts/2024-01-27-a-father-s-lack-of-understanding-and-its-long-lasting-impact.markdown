Gaming has always played an important role in my life. Ever since I was young, I would immerse myself in colorful, magical worlds to escape from my anxieties and problems. While other activities brought me joy, gaming offered a special sense of comfort and community I couldn't find elsewhere. Unfortunately, my father never understood this crucial coping mechanism and saw my hobby only as a waste of time.   
### The Controller Snapping Incident
One night, during a particularly intense gaming session, my father barged into my room in a fit of rage. **"critical thinking and problem-solving gaming skills"** were not good enough in his eyes. Before I could react, he snatched the controller from my hands and snapped it in two. The sound of cracking plastic still rings in my ears to this day. Shock and anger flooded through me as I watched him destroy something so meaningful without a second thought.

### The Laptop Smashing Disaster
Not long after, I saved up to buy my own gaming laptop, hoping to find some freedom and escape again. However, my father's controlling behavior only escalated. One afternoon, he stormed into my room unannounced while I was in the middle of an important match. Without warning, he grabbed my laptop and hurled it against the wall, shattering the screen into pieces. The destruction left me feeling hollow and betrayed. My safe haven was taken away in an instant by the one person meant to protect me.
### An Irreparable Rift
In that moment, something inside me broke. All the years of belittlement and lack of understanding had piled up, and smashing my laptop was the final straw. I confronted my father, making it clear his toxic behavior was unacceptable and I wanted nothing more to do with him. Though the decision pained me, cutting him out of my life seemed the healthiest choice. Over a decade later, we remain estranged with no hope for reconciliation or healing the deep scars he inflicted.  
### Long-Lasting Trauma and Trust Issues 
His actions caused trauma that lingers to this day. I struggle with anxiety, low self-esteem, and difficulty opening up to authority figures thanks to his emotional abuse under the guise of "parenting." Perhaps most unfortunately of all, the constant invalidation of my interests and boundaries has left deep-seated trust issues that sabotage my personal relationships. While I have learned healthy coping mechanisms, the psychological scars of his disproportionate wrath and disrespect may never fully fade.
### An Opportunity for Growth 
My story demonstrates the importance of parental understanding, especially during formative years. **technology-using youth mental health** necessitate compassion, not condemnation. A child's interests deserve respect, and non-violent conflict resolution prevails over aggression every time. Most of all, every person deserves autonomy over their mental well-being and safe hobbies. Though the past can't change, I hope shining light on these issues creates opportunity for others to grow in empathy, acceptance and nurturing healthy individuality in kids. Ultimately, that yields the most fulfilling life for all.
