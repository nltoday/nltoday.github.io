Games are one of the most popular forms of entertainment today. With the rise of digital distribution, game launchers like Steam and Origin have become essential platforms for players to access and play their library of games. While both launchers serve a similar purpose, there are some key differences between Steam and Origin that are worth examining.
### Game Library and Sales
One major distinguishing factor is the size and breadth of each platform's game library. [Steam has accumulated a massive collection](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-crazy-boston-terrier-lady-dog-lover-v-neck-t-shirt/women&) of over 30,000 games since its inception in 2003. Developers of all sizes regularly release new titles on Steam, ensuring players always have new games to discover. In comparison, Origin's library is considerably smaller at around 250 games, consisting primarily of titles published by EA. 
This discrepancy in catalog size is reflected in the types of deals and sales each platform offers. **Steam frequently runs seasonal mega sales** that slash prices on thousands of games by up to 90%. Its discovery features also help highlight deals. Meanwhile, Origin sales tend to focus on a curated selection of EA games and franchises like Battlefield or Star Wars. The smaller scope means **better bargains can be harder to find on Origin compared to Steam's fire sales**.
For players seeking variety or looking for a steal, Steam's expansive selection and sales give it a notable advantage over Origin in this area. However, Origin ensures any games in its library are compatible and work well on its platform.

### Game Access and Integration 
Another difference lies in how integrated games are with each launcher. On Origin, **EA titles are exclusively available through its platform** and require Origin to be running to launch games. This provides tighter integration but also means players have no alternative storefront option for newer EA games. 
On the other hand, **Steam has a more open philosophy toward third-party games and stores**. While many games like Skyrim or Counter-Strike are best experienced through Steam, some high-profile titles from other publishers like Ubisoft or Activision Blizzard also appear on other stores. This gives players more flexibility in where and how they access games.
At the same time, Steam's wide compatibility means **games are not always optimized for its service**. Origin aims to provide streamlined access and support directly tailored to EA games. Some players prefer this hands-on approach, though it limits options. Overall, personal preference weighs heavily on which platform offers a more seamless game experience.
### Performance and Features 
When it comes to the underlying technology powering each launcher, both Steam and Origin have improved significantly over the years. However, early adopters may recall Steam once had a reputation for being **buggy and resource-intensive**. Nowadays, **Valve has refined Steam into a lean and stable client**.
Similarly, past versions of Origin strained systems more than players liked. But in the modern era of **Origin Access and subscribtion perks like Play First Trials**, EA's platform runs comparably light and smooth. Both services also offer robust social features, cloud saves, workshops, and other tools to enhance the gaming experience. 
The gap in technical performance has mostly closed between Steam and Origin. However, as the larger and more established storefront, **Steam naturally has more bells and whistles** like the Steam Workshop, remote play, and a built-in web browser. Origin aims to match these capabilities over time while focusing first on game delivery. Overall, most users will not notice major functional differences between the two launchers in 2022 and beyond.
### Developer Perspective 
An oft-overlooked angle is how each store influences game development. From the creator side, **Steam's default 30% revenue share for all sales is a huge tax for indie studios scraping by**. While Steam unquestionably exposes games to a broader audience, its high fees present challenges for smaller teams.
In contrast, services like the **Epic Games Store and initiatives like Origin Access bring welcome competition to the distribution landscape**. With alternatives placing fewer restrictions on studios, **developers feel empowered to negotiate deals that favour their bottom line over Valve's**. A balance of revenue and creative control helps the industry.
From many independent developers' viewpoints, platforms that value mutual benefit over dominance earn more goodwill long term. Acknowledging this background provides perspective on why some choose to release on services besides Steam, even if their storefront may lack certain features. At the end of the day, maintaining healthy competition supports all parties, including players.
### Choosing Between Steam and Origin
For most casual PC gamers, either Steam or Origin will suit their needs well enough. The decision often comes down more to a person's game preferences and digital library rather than technical aspects. Those whose collections consist primarily of EA titles may find Origin's tighter focus appealing. 
Meanwhile, players seeking variety or access to niche indie games will appreciate Steam's enormous scope. Being able to seamlessly interconnect purchases across Windows, Mac, and Linux also gives Steam an edge for flexibility. 
Ultimately, both launchers fulfill their core function of enabling great games. Most agree competition in the digital marketplace creates desired improvements on all fronts. Gamers can feel assured that whether choosing Steam, Origin, or alternatives, their favorite pastime remains well-supported into the future.
