## Understanding Your Tax Obligations  
As a salaried individual or professional, it is important to understand your tax filing obligations. In India, individuals whose total income exceeds the basic exemption limit are required to file an Income Tax Return (ITR) by the due date. **The basic exemption limit for Assessment Year 2023-24 is Rs. 2.5 lakh.** 
While the due date for most individuals to file ITR is July 31, 2023, there are some exceptions where you can file a belated return or revised return within a prescribed time period. It is always advisable to understand the applicable due dates and ensure compliance to avoid penalties. 
## Choosing the Right ITR Form
There are various ITR forms based on an individual's source of income and tax residency status. **ITR-1 (SAHAJ)** is the most common form for salaried individuals having income from salary and one house property. **ITR-2** is for individuals/HUFs having income from salary, one house property and other sources of income. 
Review your income components from the previous year and match it to the eligibility criteria of each ITR form. Downloading the correct utility from the e-filing portal is important to ensure accurate reporting of income and computation of taxes payable.
### Filling Out The ITR Form  
The key steps to filling out an ITR form are:
1. Gather all relevant documents like Form 16, bank interest certificates, capital gains statements etc.
2. Import income details from Form 16 to ITR automatically using the pre-filled data on the e-filing website.
3. **Manually enter income from other sources like rent, interest, capital gains etc**  
4. Claim applicable deductions under Sections 80C, 80D, HRA etc. 
5. Calculate total taxable income and tax payable  
6. Verify the ITR online using Aadhaar OTP authentication. 
Take your time to fill every field correctly for a smooth filing experience. Refer to the instructions tab within the utility for help.

## Computing Tax Liability
Once you have entered all income sources and deductions in the ITR form, the next important step is to compute your [total taxable income and tax liability accurately](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-doberman-dog-face-pup-pet-puppy-lover-best-dad-mom-ever-v-neck-t-shirt/men&). 
You can refer to the relevant finance act for applicable tax slabs and rates. Alternatively, use an online income tax calculator to simplify the computation process. The calculator will accept your income details and provide the breakup of tax payable.   
## Paying Outstanding Tax Dues
If your income tax calculator shows a positive tax payable amount, you need to clear all pending dues before the ITR filing due date. Taxes can be paid online through net banking, UPI, credit/debit cards on the income tax e-filing portal. 
Obtain a payment acknowledgement receipt for your records. Only upon successful payment of full taxes will your ITR filing be considered complete. Any outstanding tax amount may attract interest as per provisions of the Income Tax Act.
## Filing Belated or Revised ITR
In some cases where you missed the original ITR due date, you can still file a belated return within the prescribed time limit to regularize your tax compliance. Revised ITR can also be filed to correct any errors or omissions in the original ITR filed. 
Take expert tax consulting to understand your eligibility and implications before proceeding with a belated or revised filing. Proper documentation and full tax payment is required even in these post-date filings.
## Record Keeping Practices
Once your ITR is filed and verified, it is recommended to maintain soft or hard copies of the ITR acknowledgment and all supporting documents for a period of at least 6 years. This helps in future reference for income tax scrutiny or proceedings if any. 
Those seeking home loans or other financing also may require past ITR documents as part of the credit application process. Proper maintenance of your tax filing records is therefore important from both compliance and convenience perspectives.
In conclusion, following the due dates and filing a correct and complete ITR annually ensures that you are true to your tax obligations as a citizen of India. Technology has simplified the process, but compliance still demands discipline, care and accurate declaration.
