Agatha was known around the neighborhood as being fiercely protective of her children. While some saw her as overbearing, she believed a mother's role was to ensure her kids felt safe and respected - even if that meant taking matters into her own hands at times. Here are a few stories that highlight Agatha's unique approach to dealing with threats against her family.
### Defending with Hot Chocolate  
One chilly afternoon at a [Giants baseball game](https://store.fi.io.vn/french-bulldog-frenchie-dog-black-dog-lover-frenchies-1), Agatha's youngest son was harassed by an intoxicated man trying to make him spill his hot chocolate. When the man refused to stop after Agatha warned him, she splashed her own hot drink in his face. The man quickly retreated, realizing he'd messed with the wrong mother.

### Standing Up to Bullies
A few years prior, Agatha's other son was **bullied and humiliated** by an older neighborhood boy. She later saw the boy walking down the street and got revenge by urinating in a cup and throwing the contents on him. Her blunt threat that she'd do the same to his mother ensured neither returned to trouble her family again.
### Protecting With Principle 
Agatha firmly believed children shouldn't have to endure mistreatment. When Elijah came home in tears after **his prized pencil was broken** by the class bully, Stefan, she took action. By **exaggerating the circumstances** to the school, Agatha motivated them to discipline Stefan and reimburse her son. Her creative approach taught Elijah that a mother will go far to defend their dignity.
### Empowering Through Example
While some felt Agatha's tactics crossed lines, she saw herself as teaching valuable life lessons. By standing up for her sons without fear of confrontation, she set an example of empowerment through courage and assertiveness. Both boys grew to feel protected knowing their mother wouldn't hesitate to stick up for them, **even if it ruffled some feathers** along the way.
### Finding Alternative Solutions  
Though aggressive at times, Agatha didn't intend harm. Her priority was resolving issues and preventing future problems, not retaliation. After the incident with Stefan, she ensured he was moved away from Elijah to diffuse tensions. And despite throwing hot chocolate, her threat to the baseball fan discouraged further harassment without physical violence. By creatively deescalating conflicts, Agatha focused on practical solutions over meaningless disputes.
### Understanding Motherly Instincts
With age and experience, Elijah realized his mother's tactics, while unorthodox, effectively dealt with challenges he faced as a child. Rather than judge her methods, he came to appreciate the deep love and fierce instincts that drove her unconventional approaches. A mother's priority will always be protecting her young, even if that means ruffling a few feathers or pushing boundaries along the way.
