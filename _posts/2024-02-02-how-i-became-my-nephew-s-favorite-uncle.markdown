## The Beginning
When my elder sister first gave birth to her son in 2014, I was unsure about our future relationship. As the youngest child, I had a difficult relationship with our Uncle growing up. So I assumed history would repeat itself and my new nephew wouldn't like me either. 
My sister lived abroad at the time, so I didn't meet my nephew until after his first birthday. As I predicted, he seemed indifferent towards me and preferred being with my dad. Nonetheless, I hoped over time we could form a close bond.
### An Unexpected Turning Point 
One day, I took my nephew outside for a stroll on the rooftop patio. Still learning to walk at his young age, he fell while navigating an uneven patch of ground. Naturally, he began crying tears. Trying everything to console him, I made silly faces and moved him around playfully to no avail. 
In a moment of desperation, I tried imitating a British accent through nonsense baby talk. Remarkably, it made him stop crying immediately. He started laughing joyfully instead as I continued in character. It was such a beautiful sound that cemented our relationship from that moment on.

## Building Our Special Bond
From then on, my nephew began seeing me differently. Whenever we played together, I would use [funny voices and impersonations](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/bulldog) to make him giggle. It soon became our little activity just between us.  
### Our Favorite Games
One game involved imitating farm animals through exaggerated noises and motions. Another was pretending I was a monster chasing him around. He seemed to relish these moments of pretend more than anything else. 
His laughter and smiles when we played brought me such joy. Slowly but surely, the bond between us strengthened through our memorable interactions.
## Becoming Each Other's Favorite
A few years later when visiting my sister's home, it was clear how close we had become. While he still loved spending time with his mom, he lit up the most upon seeing me arrive.
### My Special Role
Rather than seeming aloof like before, now he eagerly reached out wanting me to hold and play with him. If I so much as glanced elsewhere, he would calling out "Uncle! Uncle!" until I gave him my full attention once more. 
My sister commented how dependent he was on me during visits. It warmed my heart knowing the initial doubts were unfounded - through patience and fun memories together, I had become his most cherished family member.
## Our Everlasting Connection
Even as he grows older, our special relationship remains. Whether just chatting or reminiscing about our favorite past games, being together feels natural and easy. 
While he adores his parents and other relatives too, the bond we carved out through quality time together in his early years can never be replicated. My nephew will always hold a special place in my heart as the first to see past initial indifference into the Uncle devoted to bringing him endless joy.
