Steam is the largest digital storefront for PC games. A very useful feature on Steam is being able to see the current player count for games. This data can provide helpful insight into a game's popularity and longevity. However, there are also some caveats to consider when using concurrent player numbers to evaluate games. Let's take a deeper look at how useful—and not—Steam's player counts can be when choosing your next game purchase.
### [Current Player Counts Are Most Useful for Recently Released Multiplayer Games](https://store.fi.io.vn/play-well-with-others-otter-lover-animal-marine-biologist-1) 
Steam's concurrent player numbers are most indicative of a game's popularity and player base for titles that were recently released or focused on multiplayer gameplay. For a new first-person shooter or battle royale game primarily featuring online multiplayer modes, seeing only a few hundred players currently in-game would suggest it may be difficult to find matches or that the game is already declining in players. However, player counts shouldn't necessarily be the sole factor when considering single-player games or ones released years ago.

### **Older Games May Have Low Player Counts Due to Their Age, Not Quality**
Just because an older single-player game from 5-10 years ago only shows a few thousand current players does not mean it is a bad game. Many classic beloved titles now have relatively small player bases as the player community has migrated to newer releases over time. A low player count for an older game like Dark Souls or Portal should not discourage purchasing it, as the game quality and single-player content is unrelated to the current online population years later.
### **New Games May See Artificially Inflated Player Counts at Launch** 
In the first few weeks after a major new release, a game's concurrent player number on Steam can appear very high as many people download it to try out on day one. However, this initial surge of players does not necessarily indicate long-term popularity or success. Some games may lose over 90% of their peak player counts within the first month as early adopters move on or find issues. Short-term high numbers right after launch provide limited insight compared to figures weeks or months later.
### **Non-Steam Versions Are Not Counted in Player Numbers** 
Many popular games are available for purchase both on Steam and directly from their developer/publisher. Only players using the Steam version of a game will contribute to the concurrent player stats seen on the Steam store page. Titles with big non-Steam communities like Fortnite, Apex Legends, or World of Warcraft may seem less popular on Steam than they actually are with their total player bases across all platforms not represented.
### **Large, Active Modding Communities Extend Game Lifespans** 
Some older games continue attracting players years later thanks to dedicated modding communities that drastically expand and alter the core game experience through new maps, modes, quests, and overhauls. Iconic PC games like Skyrim, Garry's Mod, and Minecraft often have surprisingly high player counts for their age because constant updates from mod authors keep drawing in both new and returning players. Mod support allows these games to reinvent and extend themselves indefinitely.
### **YouTube and Streaming Popularity Also Affects Player Counts** 
Games that achieve a major surge in online popularity through memes, YouTube videos, or Twitch streams may see a temporary bump in players on Steam. However, this boost is unlikely to last long-term if the core game itself does not hold continued appeal. Nevertheless, games with a large dedicated streaming community have a better chance at retaining more players over the years through continued exposure.
In conclusion, while Steam's concurrent user stats are certainly useful for evaluating recent multiplayer releases or judging the ongoing player population of live-service games, they should not be taken as absolute indicators of quality for older titles or ones with communities spread across platforms. Consider contextual factors like a game's age, monetization model, mod/streaming support when interpreting player count data as one data point among others when researching potential new purchases. Long-term quality and enjoyment per dollar spent are more important than raw player numbers alone.
