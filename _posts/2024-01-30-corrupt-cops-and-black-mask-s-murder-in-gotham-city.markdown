### A Dark Christmas Eve
It was a cold winter night in Gotham. [Detective Harvey Bullock](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-duck-gift-for-mom-mother-duckling-duck-waterfowl-lovers-v-neck-t-shirt/women&) and his partner **Renee Montoya** were called to the scene of a suspected arson and homicide. When they arrived, they found the burnt remains of a small warehouse. After sifting through the ashes and debris, they discovered a badly charred corpse. Based on what remained of the clothing, it seemed to be a man. 
Near the body, they found a partial fingerprint under some soot left from a molotov cocktail's explosion. Running it through their database, it came back a match for Oswald Cobblepot, also known as **The Penguin**. However, they knew Penguin had powerful friends in high places within the corrupt GCPD. Unless they had irrefutable evidence, any charges against him would never stick.

### Black Mask's Criminal Empire
Word soon spread that the victim was one of Black Mask's top lieutenants, who had recently fallen out of favor. As the crime lord who controlled much of Gotham's criminal underworld through fear and violence, Roman Sionis, aka **Black Mask**, didn't take betrayal lightly. 
Bullock and Montoya suspected Sionis had learned of the lieutenant's plan to switch allegiances and marked him for death. But proving Black Mask's involvement without arousing suspicion from their crooked superiors would be no easy task. The corrupt police commissioner, Loeb, had long turned a blind eye to Black Mask's bloody rise to power in exchange for stacks of untraceable cash.
### A Clue in the Ashes  
After sifting through the ashes more carefully, Renee discovered a partial print hidden under the soot. Running it through the database again produced a surprise match - to Roman Sionis himself. They now had the evidence they needed to bring Black Mask himself in for questioning.
However, in their experience, guys like Sionis always had contingencies. Bullock was almost certain Black Mask would already have people inside the precinct ready to erase or dissolve any evidence against him. They'd have to keep their investigation under tight wraps and hope to lure him into a slip up during the interrogation.
### Black Mask Pulls the Strings
That night, they brought Black Mask down to the interrogation room, but he remained unfazed. Claiming he was just out for a stroll when he came across the fire, Sionis toyed with the pair, confident in his influence over the corrupt system. 
As they suspected, someone inside the department was tipping Black Mask off. All records of the prints had vanished from the system. Without proof, they had no choice but to let him walk. Black Mask shot the detectives a mocking grin as he exited, making it clear he knew they were onto him but remained untouchable.
### A Familiar Face Emerges 
A few nights later, while staking out one of Black Mask's known hideouts, Bullock and Montoya spotted a suspicious figure lurking in the shadows. Drawing closer, they realized it was Bruce Wayne, the young billionaire playboy who had recently returned to Gotham after years abroad. 
Intrigued by his interest in Black Mask's operation, they approached him for answers. Wayne claimed he was merely investigating a lead for one of his family's charities, but the detectives sensed there was more to his story. They agreed to share notes if he promised to be careful around someone as dangerous as Black Mask.
### The Mysterious Vigilante Strikes
That same night, Black Mask's operation suffered a crippling series of mysterious break-ins and sabotage. Guns and drugs were destroyed, records were revealed exposing criminal collaborators, and several top lieutenants ended up badly injured and zip-tied for police pickup. 
The press dubbed the unknown assailant "The **Batman**" for the symbol left at each crime scene. Sionis was furious at the sudden spanner in his well-oiled machine. Though clues were few, Bullock and Montoya wondered if perhaps Bruce Wayne wasn't exactly the idle playboy he appeared.
### A New Mystery Emerges
In the aftermath of Batman's disruptions, Black Mask grew increasingly erratic and paranoid. During another interrogation, Sionis let slip he suspected an inside man had tipped Batman off on his operations. 
This piqued Bullock and Montoya's interest - if Black Mask thought one of his own people had turned, it implied the mysterious Batman might have sources within the criminal underworld as well. They began to suspect there was much more to this new vigilante than met the eye.
### A Message Left Behind 
A few nights later, Batman delivered his boldest message yet, leaving Black Mask in a terrified, incoherent state, zip-tied for the police on the steps of city hall. Acallingcard was pinned above him with hastily scrawled writing: "Leave the city or there will be more." 
The message was clear - Batman had declared war. Bullock and Montoya realized this was only the beginning. This new dark knight was going to upend the balance of power in Gotham and drag all its corruption into the light, whether the criminals and crooked cops liked it or not.
