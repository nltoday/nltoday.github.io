Narcissists conduct themselves in an entitled and exploitative manner. While it may seem like they face no consequences for wrongdoings, ultimately their behavior will catch up to them through narcissistic injuries that expose their true nature.
### Unraveling Relationships 
Narcissists view rules and commitments as non-binding to themselves. [Marriage vows are broken](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/adan) through lies and cheating without regard for the hurt caused. Over time, people grow tired of the constant deception and **unreliable relationships fall apart**. As close bonds unravel, the narcissist's support network dwindles.

### Declining Reputations  
With each broken promise and unpaid debt, a narcissist's credibility erodes. **Trustworthiness is compromised** as exploits and falsehoods are revealed. Their reputation takes a nosedive among former allies reluctant to be manipulated again. Isolated and distrusted, the narcissist finds fewer willing to believe or assist them going forward. 
### Consequences Mount
As issues pile up through their own actions, narcissists face legitimate penalties. **Legal ramifications ensue** for wrongs that can no longer be ignored, such as unpaid bills taken to court. Judgments and liens stain records for years. **Dating prospects shrink** as w√ºr their toxic tendencies, leaving the narcissist lonely with only their inflated self for company.
### Narcissistic Injuries Strike
Any attempt to establish **healthy relationship boundaries** is perceived by the narcissist as a grievous injury to their ego. When the inevitable injury occurs, the narcissist can no longer hide behind a facade of fake virtue. Their true vindictive, abusive colors show in retaliation against the perceived source of the wound.
### Downward Spiral Begins
Health, career, and finances start trending downward after too many **narcissistic episodes**. Repeated outrages drive away remaining allies unwilling to subject themselves to tantrums and retaliation. Isolated and depleted, narcissists find themselves with dwindling choices outside of facing reality and changing toxic patterns. For most, painful **rock bottom** must be hit before authentic change could possibly unfold.
### Empty Promises Exposed 
While narcissists promise much to get what they want in the moment, following through is another matter. Over time, the repetition of **unfulfilled vows** rubs raw those granting the benefit of doubt. Reality ultimately overrides even elaborate wordplay and sweet nothings the narcissist may use to deflect. Their true nature stands clear through consistent **actions versus words.**
### No Place Left to Hide
As masks fall away, the depth of deception practiced for so long is laid bare. Few if any regrets are expressed for the path laid waste. At this most naked point, narcissists have fully alienated all potential sources of **non-conditional support**. Alone in the rubble of their own making, nowhere is left to run or hide from the destructive core they denied while it burned networks to the ground.
