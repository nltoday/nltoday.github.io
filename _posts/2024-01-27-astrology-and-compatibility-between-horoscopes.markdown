Understanding compatibility between horoscopes requires more than just looking at Sun signs or dates of birth. A manual analysis is needed to factor in planetary periods and aspects. Here is a deeper look:
### Examining Charts Created by Software 
Software can generate accurate birth charts based on time, place and date of birth. **However, the positioning of planets alone does not determine compatibility or life outcomes.** It is crucial to analyze planetary periods to see if favorable placements will be active during one's lifetime. For example, an exalted planet may not provide benefits if its period has already passed by the time of birth. compatibility must factor in the **timing of planetary influences.**

### Assessing the 7th and 8th Houses 
The 7th house represents marriage and partners, while the 8th house governs intimacy, secrets and transformations. When evaluating compatibility, it is important to closely examine **Venus and the Moon in relation to these houses.** Venus signifies romance and intimacy, while the Moon represents emotions and needs. Their placement and aspects will color the nature of a relationship.

### Decoding Mars' Influence  
While often maligned in compatibility analysis, Mars' placement must be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Mars represents assertion, attraction and energy levels. In the right house and sign, it can energize a relationship. However, its weak placement or difficult aspects require mitigation from other benefic planets like Venus. **Overemphasizing Mars's role can result in inaccurate assessments of relationships.**
### Considering Planetary Periods
Software alone cannot determine when the periods of favorable placements arrive. Manual analysis of **planetary periods in relation to the Dashas** is needed to identify the optimal windows for smooth relating and decision making. For example, a chart may show excellent compatibility, but the periods facilitating it may only become active in middle age. such nuances impact feasibility.
### Incorporating Qualitative Details 
Charts do not provide full pictures of individuals. Key life details provide valuable context for compatibility readings. For instance, one partner lacking motivation may be overcome during energizing planetary periods hinted in the chart. Or, in a case where charts align perfectly but **lifestyles and priorities wildly differ,** manual review of goals and values is warranted before making predictions. Charts can only show potential - lifestyle must be considered.
### Integrating Traditional Wisdom 
While compatibility based on Sun signs alone is imperfect, the core tenets of astrology around elements and modalities do indicate basic compatibilities. However, **these generalizations should not be rigidly applied** - especially when zodiacal differences are mitigated by other planetary placements and aspects. Individual charts always provide higher resolution than blanket statements. Traditional wisdom offers guidance, not hard rules, for relationships.
