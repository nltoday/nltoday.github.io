### Focus on the Individual Needs of Each Student
Unlike other large MBA coaching institutes that follow a one-size-fits-all approach, Edushastra believes that every student is unique and has their own strengths and weaknesses. They divide students into small batches of only 20-25 based on an initial assessment of their quantitative, verbal, and logical skills. This ensures that each student receives personalized attention from the teachers. 
Within these homogeneous batches, students are further divided into different **ability-based groups** based on periodic evaluations. The coaching material and pace of learning are customized for each group. Students are only promoted to the next level once they have completely grasped the concepts of their current level. This adaptive learning approach addresses the varying abilities and learning speeds of each individual.

### Unlimited Attempts for Practice and Revision
At Edushastra, the focus is on conceptual learning rather than just finishing the syllabus. They follow an **ability-based learning model** where students can keep attending lecture cycles, taking practice tests, and revising until they have mastered each topic. There is no rigid time-bound schedule that forces students to move ahead even if they are not ready. 
Students have access to unlimited live online classes, recorded lectures, and practice question banks for topics they need extra help with. This allows even below-average students to reach a high level of preparation given enough time and practice attempts. The learning never stops until the student is confident about their abilities.
### Small Batch Sizes for Maximum Engagement 
Most top MBA coaching centers batch students in large groups of 60-70 students to maximize their revenue. However, this makes it difficult for introverted students to clear doubts or engage with the teacher. 
Edushastra limits each batch to just 20-25 students to promote higher engagement and interaction. With fewer students, teachers can focus their attention on identifying strengths and weaknesses of every individual. Students feel comfortable asking any number of questions without fear of judgment from peers.
### Industry Expert Faculties
All teachers at Edushastra are highly qualified professionals with decades of experience in their respective fields. Many hold doctorate degrees from top universities abroad and have worked with prestigious organizations like McKinsey, Goldman Sachs, etc.
They bring deep **real-world expertise** and current industry knowledge to the classroom. Whether it's topics related to quantitative analysis, verbal skills or case-study teachings, students gain in-depth insights beyond what is prescribed in textbooks. This holistic development helps immensely during interviews as well.
### Comprehensive Learning Resources
Unlike many coaching centers that charge extra for mock tests and other study materials, Edushastra includes everything in one consolidated fee. Along with live online classes covering the entire CAT syllabus, students get access to:
- Hundreds of high-quality recorded video lectures for reinforcement  
- Previous year question papers and topic tests
- Dedicated modules for OMAT, WAT, and GD/PI preparations
- In-depth study notes compiled by experts
- 24/7 academic support via Telegram channels and forums
This comprehensive learning ecosystem provides all the necessary [learning resources](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/alkire) to prepare for CAT from scratch with minimal external expenses.
### Tailored Mentorship Approach
The best part about coaching at Edushastra is the personalized mentorship and hand-holding provided to each student throughout their preparation journey. Every student is assigned a dedicated faculty mentor based on their profile. 
The mentors regularly track test performances, identify problem areas, provide one-on-one guidance sessions and keep the students motivated. Students can directly chat or video call their mentors any time for doubts or career advice. This ensures a highly customized learning experience tailored to individual needs and doubts using a dedicated **mentorship model.**
### Money Back Guarantee for Results
While most institutes cannot guarantee CAT scores, Edushastra has proven records of students achieving top percentiles year after year. Such has been their confidence in teaching methodology that they offer a **unique refund policy** - if any student is unable to clear CAT even after 2 years of preparation with them, they will refund the entire fees. 
This takes away all pressure and risk from students who are free to fully focus on learning without short-term targets. The institutes' priority is consistently producing well-trained candidates capable of cracking top B-schools through merit rather than lateral entries or management quotas.
### Lifetime Access to Resources and Support   
Students who join Edushastra build long-term associations for their management dreams rather than just a one-year transactional engagement. The preparation provided remains valid even if a student requires another attempt next year.
They can continue attending live classes, taking practice tests and getting mentorship without paying anything extra. This gives time flexibility and **lifelong learning support** until the candidate succeeds rather than compromising their goal due to time or budget constraints in just one attempt.
