### Grading and Scaling Pattern Design
Burberry is well known for its iconic Nova check print that comes in a variety of colors and patterns. The print is a signature of the brand and what customers expect when purchasing Burberry products. Like many luxury brands, Burberry offers smaller sizing compared to mass market retailers due to the process of [grading and scaling patterns](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/corgi). When starting pattern design, sample sizes are cut starting from a designated sample size, often a size 4 or 6. The original pattern is then scaled up or down proportionally through a mathematical **grading process** to create additional sizes.

### Vanity Sizing vs Proportional Grading
Mass market retailers commonly use a 2 inch grading scale where waist measurements increase by 2 inches with each size. However, luxury brands like Burberry employ a **tighter 1.5 inch proportional grading** for a more precise fit. The half inch difference has a major impact on fit as sizes increase or decrease. Additionally, mass brands engage in **"vanity sizing"** where the labeled size is larger than the actual measurement for perceived psychological benefits. This means what is a size 8 at Burberry could be a size 2 elsewhere despite being the same dimensions.
### Fitting for Shape vs Length 
Because of the more **accurate proportional grading** used, Burberry and other designer pieces tend to fit the body shape much better straight off the rack compared to mass brands. When alterations are needed for designer clothes, they typically only involve hemlines rather than major fitting adjustments like taking in the waist. Customers can feel assured sizes at luxury brands like Burberry will fit their measurements closely without vanity-motivated mislabeling.
### Evolution of Women's Sizing Over Time
Sizing standards have objectively increased over the decades as average body sizes have grown. Patternmaker mannequins from the late 1990s that were a standardized size 8 would be considered smaller than a 2016 size 6. While body image norms are culturally subjective, the measurable progression shows **women's clothing sizes have inflated overall since 1999**. This size increase is part of what allows mass retailers to use looser 2 inch grading scales that still technically fit a broad range of current sizes.
### Designer Sizing Requires Going By Fit Not Number 
With their precise **1.5 inch proportional grading**, Burberry and other luxury brands genuinely make smaller sizes overall compared to high street equivalents. However, this tighter grading means the labeled size number may differ from what customers are used to at other stores. Customers need to focus on how the garment **fits their individual shape and dimensions** rather than strictly comparing the number alone. Often going up one size from a usual high street size will result in a perfect fit from Burberry and maintain the brand's hallmark tailored silhouette.
### Impact of Proportional Grading on Design 
By employing **precise proportional grading scales** that truly match body measurements, brands like Burberry are able to maintain their signature looks and levels of quality through the full size range. The rigorous and technical grading process also allows their designs to translate properly from sample garments to mass production runs. It is this commitment to accurate and proportional **grading and scaling of patterns** that enables Burberry to achieve their reputation for impeccably tailored styles across genders and sizes.
