## Understanding the Controls
When first starting out in Super Smash Bros, the controls can seem daunting with so many buttons and stick inputs to memorize. However, breaking it down step-by-step makes it more manageable. **The joy-cons** offer a unique control scheme that requires some adjustments compared to a traditional controller. 
To perform regular attacks, the A button is used whether alone or together with the control stick. **Tilt attacks** are easiest done by pressing A while gently tilting the stick in a direction. For **smash attacks**, either press A and B together while tilting hard or set the A+B Smash option enabled. **Special moves** are triggered by pressing B alone or with a direction. Grabbing is assigned to Y by default.
The lack of a second control stick on the joy-cons makes executing certain moves tricky. But with some tweaks, consistent control is achievable even on the compact joy-con.
## Customizing Controls for Precision 
The first customization is disabling **"tap jump"**, which avoids accidental jumps. This allows tilting the stick upward solely for **up tilt attacks** without leaping. 
**"Low stick sensitivity"** is also critical. This decreases the window for registering a smash versus a tilt. Since A+B Smash is available, tilts are performed with A alone for accuracy.  
With fewer unwanted inputs, focus shifts to comfortable execution. Placing a second jump button like L or R on the triggers facilitates **short hop aerials** seamlessly. Shoulder buttons provide a third finger dedicated to jumping without clenching the controller awkwardly.
These adjustments eliminate unintentional options during critical moments. **Simple tilts and precise short hops** become effortless even on a single joy-con.
## Developing Fundamental Skills
Once comfortable with the controls, it's time to hone essential techniques. The most basic yet impactful is perfecting full and short hops. Practice jumping without any attack just to internalize height differences.
Integrate tilts, especially forward and back airs, into short hop gameplay. Space them carefully at the edge for **safe pressure and zoning**. Forward tilts punish whiffs and back airs halt approaches. 
Work on consistently executing smash attacks too. Nothing shuts down aggression better than well-spaced down, up, or forward smashes. Practice their angles using the gound as a visual guide. 
Lastly, don't neglect throws. Grabs open risks and lead to **damage racking combos** when followed smoothly by tilts. A great way to build habits is repeating throw-tilt sequences in training.
With repetition, these rudiments become second nature. Their coordination is key to dominating neutral exchanges.
## Advancing to Advanced Techniques
Once comfortable with movement and neutral exchanges, expand the toolkit. Dash dancing, the backbone of mindgames, needs to feel fluid. Practice dashing back and forth at different speeds. 
Jump cancelling adds mindblowing mixup potentials. After a jump squat, immediately input a tilt or smash. This confuses opponents and whiffs punish mercilessly. 
Shorthop aerial chains keep pressure incessant. Flicker between fast aerials like nairs or rising-angled bairs. Their quick disruption gives no breathing room. 
For killing power, learn reliable edgeguarding. Hungry box's wall of pain with back airs is a go-to. Or gimp recoveries early with well-spaced downtowns and spike hitboxes.
Incorporate **"attack canceling"** into offensive strings for constant mind gaming. Input a tilt immediately after any aerial end lag expires. 
Mastery of advanced tactics optimized pressure to the extreme. Opponents clutch helplessly against the barrage of mixups.
## Developing a Gameplan
While mechanics matter, goals and strategy ensure their effectiveness. Identify your character's strengths like combo games, stage control, or edgeguarding. Focus gameplans around amplifying strengths.
Ask which stages suit strengths best. For example, platforms empower combo characters while open stages favor zoning. Counterpick accordingly in a tournament setting. 
Scout potential opponents to prepare custom strategies. Zone-breakers demand patience while speedsters necessitate whiff punishment. Adapt playstyles situationally.
In matches, maintain mental notes on habits. Which attacks do they panic mash or DI poorly? Exploit tells ruthlessly with baits and reads.
Between games, analyze losses objectively to patch weaknesses. Did lack of defense lead to early KOs? Work on defensive options in the lab. 
With purpose driving practice, random button mashing evolves into **calculated gameplay**. Victory results from strategy outweighing mechanics.
## Tournament Preparation
Entering tournaments tests everything learned. Mentality work proves most pivotal for success. Accept likely losses humbly as learning experiences. 
On-stage nerves weaken execution, so find pre-match relaxation. Deep breaths or favorite songs calm the mind. Positive self-talk boosts confidence during sets. 
Scouting top players reveals how characters perform at highest levels. Emulate spacing, punishes, and adaptability. Studying matchups teaches winning scenarios.
Lastly, make sure finger, hand, and wrist stretches prevent injury. Marathons of high-APM gameplay strain muscles if not warmed up properly. 
Come ready to observe and improve even from loses. Growth happens outside comfort zones, so embrace challenges bravely. With dedication to mastery, rankings will steadily rise through competition.
## Finding Your Main
After exposure to the cast, narrow focus to a main or two. While secondaries cover weaknesses, mains let mechanics max out fully. 
Consider character attributes like speed, range, combo ability, and recoveries. Pick who suits playstyles most intrinsically. But stay open-mindedâ€”new discoveries happen through trying all.
Study high-level vods relentlessly until movesets feel natural. Then lab character-specific techniques endlessly. Being exceptionally dangerous with one outweighs being decent with many. 
Most importantly find joy while playing. A character deeply loved inspires passion for mastery. Fun keeps the grind rewarding through plateaus.
With a main locked, strengths shine in any matchup. Identify clearly while welcoming challenge constantly. Mastery lies at the end of a long, joyous journey.
## Concluding Thoughts
The journey never ends in Smash. While the basics lay foundations, constant self-improvement drives progress. Revisit fundamentals regularly alongside inventing new tactics. Analyze each loss as an opportunity rather than failure. 
Community immersion stimulates growth exponentially. Find local scenes to play, watch, learn from high levels, and build friendships strengthening the FGC. 
Most importantly, remember it's a game meant to be enjoyed. Smiles and handshakes after intense matches far outweigh any single win. Mastery arises from a love of challenge, community, and constant evolution. The pursuit of greatness never ends when passion fuels the climb.
