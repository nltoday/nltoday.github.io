Debt used to not bother me, but now I understand its dangers. Learning from Dave Ramsey taught me so much more than just getting out of debt - it completely transformed how my wife and I view money.
### My Journey Into Debt
For years, my wife and I had credit card debt and car loans that stressed our finances. Though we eliminated that debt, new "same as cash" purchases for furniture and appliances slowly pulled us back in without realizing. Carrying a balance became our new normal.

### Discovering the Truth About Our Finances 
One day, I accidentally listened to Dave Ramsey and it clicked - we were back in debt! I was shocked to truly understand the mindset shift needed. My wife resisted at first with a baby on the way, but over months we got on the same page.
### Getting Out of Debt for Good
Reading Dave's books and listening to his show regularly helped us create a plan. We never did envelopes but tracked each penny out. It was so rewarding to finally become debt-free through discipline and spending only what we had.
### Learning Valuable Financial Lessons
Dave taught us how to work as a team with money. His **zero-based budget** method keeps us accountable. Most importantly, I learned to hate debt for how it holds people back from their goals. Now we save diligently for whatever we desire to purchase.
### Changing Our Relationship with Money
FPU completely overhauled how we view spending and saving. We value cash in hand far more than things. I now debate even small purchases for weeks. Our newfound frugality allowed saving over $6,000 in just one year after FPU.  
### Planning for the Future 
We set multiple savings goals including a fully-funded emergency fund and yearly vacations. Most of all, we're ** diligently socking money away for a down payment to buy our first home, a major life milestone we never could have achieved while in debt. Learning from Dave Ramsey gave us so much more than financial freedom - it gave us a prosperous future.
