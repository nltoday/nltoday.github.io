### The Constant Speed of Light
[electromagnetic radiation propagation vacuum](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/albino) Light is a type of electromagnetic radiation that has the unique ability to propagate through empty space, also known as a vacuum. Within a vacuum, light maintains a constant speed of approximately 300,000 kilometers per second. This allows light to traverse the vast distances between celestial objects in our universe. Due to its ability to travel without relying on a transmission medium, the photons that make up light waves can theoretically travel indefinitely through the emptiness of space.

### Absorption and Scattering are Not Destruction
While light can interact with matter through absorption and scattering, these processes do not destroy or eliminate photons. When a photon encounters an atom, it may be absorbed, granting the atom's electron more energy as it moves to a higher orbital shell. The absorbed energy is then re-emitted as a lower energy photon, usually in a random direction. During scattering, a photon's path is deflected but its energy remains intact as it takes a new course. Both absorption and scattering simply convert light into other forms like heat or kinetic energy, they do not annihilate photons from existence.
### Seeing Distant Galaxies Through Timeless Light
**ancient photons observable universe** The fact that light can propagate endlessly allows us to view galaxies as they appeared billions of years ago. The light we observe today from the most distant galaxies was emitted when the universe was very young. Photons emitted shortly after the Big Bang have been travelling for approximately 13.8 billion years to finally reach our telescopes. The wavelengths of these primordial photons have increased over that vast span of time, shifting into the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum through the expansion of space itself. Still, each individual photon persists on its journey undefeated by the passage of eons.
### No Way to Know a Photon's Past or Future
At the subatomic scale of individual photons, our knowledge becomes limited. We cannot directly observe or measure a solitary photon's behavior when it is not interacting with matter. To analyze a photon is to disturb it from its isolated path through spacetime. There is no way to track a single photon backwards or forwards in time to understand what may have occurred during its travel alone in empty regions between encounters. All we can say for certain is that when a photon interacts within our detectors, it arrives without hint of degradation, as fresh and timeless as when it was first emitted long ago and far away.
### The Photon's Perspective - No Aging During Transit
**light-years spacetime relativity** Considering photons exhibit zero rest mass and always move at light speed, a profound perspective emerges from Einstein's theory of special relativity. From the frame of reference of a individual photon, no passage of time occurs during its journey. The photon is created and absorbed in the same instant, with no internal experience of the span between origins and destination even if separated by millions of light-years from our frame on Earth. This raises fascinating philosophical questions about causality and the relationship between objective and subjective flow of time. 
### Could a Photon Transform During Its Lifetime?
While textbooks describe light as unwavering in its path absent interaction, quantum mechanics introduces possibilities beyond classical models. At the smallest scales, events seem far from deterministic, ruled more by probability than absolutes. Could there exist some worldline along which an individual photon spontaneously shifts form, say transitioning from visible light to neutral pion and back before detection? We have no means to explore such a photon's adventures between points of observation. Ultimately, the eternal qualities of light exist as much in the limits of our perception as in any inherent immortality of the photons themselves.
