### Bypass Hotstar App Restrictions With UC Browser
Many users want to take screenshots and record videos from the Hotstar app for sharing clips of their favorite shows with friends and family. However, the Hotstar developers have implemented restrictions to prevent users from taking snapshots or recordings within the app. 
Fortunately, there is a workaround **by accessing Hotstar content through the UC Browser app instead.** UC Browser allows you to open other apps within its own interface, circumventing the Hotstar app's native screening restrictions. **By sliding open the Hotstar video in UC Browser, you can freely take screenshots and record screen videos using UC Browser's built-in capabilities.**

### Access Hotstar Via Website For Unrestricted Capturing
While the Hotstar apps put limitations on capturing content, the desktop and mobile websites do not have the same restrictions. **If you access hotstar.com through a browser instead of the dedicated app, you can take screenshots, screen recordings, and screen clipping of videos without issues.[ 
Many popular screen recording software programs like ](https://yt.io.vn/collection/achenbach)OBS Studio allow you to record the mobile or desktop screen.** By navigating to hotstar.com in the browser and playing a video, you can use such a recorder to capture high-quality footage of any Hotstar content. This is a hassle-free method compared to using workarounds in the app.
### Use The Print Screen Key For Screenshots
For simple screenshot needs on desktop, the standard Print Screen key allows capturing the entire screen or active window with ease. **With Hotstar videos and pages open in the browser, hitting Print Screen saves a snapshot of the display instantly.**
You can paste the screenshot into an image editor or directly into chat apps, emails, and documents for sharing moments from Hotstar shows painlessly. **The Print Screen shortcut offers a rapid one-click solution without extra software when lightweight screenshots are all that's required.**
### Clipping Software For Screen Video Extracts 
While screen recorders allow full-length captures, sometimes only short clips are needed from a Hotstar video. **Specialized video clipping programs let you trim precisely what's required without the large file sizes of complete recordings.** 
Programs like Clipchamp, ClipGrab and Screencast-O-Matic have **network stream options for opening websites right within the editor.** With Hotstar opened, their timeline tools permit clipping specific scenes or moments. **The clips are then saved as share-sized video files optimized for easy distribution over messengers and social media platforms.**
### Take Pictures Within Clipping Software Too
Interestingly, many video clipping applications double up as powerful screenshot tools as well through their built-in camera features. **They let you pause Hotstar within the timeline view and "take photo" of frozen frames, directly saving them as images.** 
This provides photographers, designers and content creators **a single solution for both high-quality screenshots as well as trimmed video bites from any Hotstar content.** The pictures can then be enhanced further using the software's photo editing tools before exporting.
### Downloading Desktop Apps For Advanced Features   
While working directly in browsers is simple, desktop apps often pack more robust screenshot and recording tools suited for advanced users. Popular examples are ShareX on Windows and Shutter on Linux, **which integrate screen capturing shortcuts across the entire system.**
After installing such an app, you can **take region screenshots, scrolling long page captures and record selective areas of the screen while browsing Hotstar for highly customizable output.** They even support annotations, image optimization and upload automation fulfilling professional needs.
### Conclusion
In summary, there are plenty of effective methods both within and outside the Hotstar ecosystem for capturing stills as well as videos from the platforms. Switching to UC Browser, using the websites, keyboard shortcuts, clipping programs or dedicated screenshot tools - you have many easy options to freely grab share-worthy snippets and preserve memories from all your favorite Hotstar shows.
