### Genetic Combination 
Human sexual reproduction involves the genetic material from both a male and a female to create a new and unique child. Each parent contributes 23 chromosomes to create 46 total chromosomes in offspring. [Egg and sperm genetic material combination](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/aggarwal) ensures genetic variation between each new generation. During meiosis, the parent cells halves their number of chromosomes from 46 to 23. Sperm or egg each carry 23 chromosomes. When a sperm fertilizes an egg, the full 46 chromosomes are restored but in a new unique combination from the parents. This genetic variation through meiotic cell division and fertilization is essential for adaptation and evolution of the human species.

### Fertilization and Implantation
After sexual intercourse, millions of sperm are ejaculated from the male into the female reproductive system. If timing coincides with ovulation, an eggs may be released from one of the female ovaries and enters the fallopian tube. In the fallopian tube, a single sperm must penetrate the egg's protective layers for **fertilization to occur inside the fallopian tube**. Fertilization happens when the genetic material from the sperm merges with the egg's nucleus. The newly formed **zygote** then undergoes cell divisions as it travels down the fallopian tube towards the uterus. Once in the uterus, the zygote must **implant and burrow into the endometrium** to receive nutrients for growth and development from the mother. Implantation is complete about 6-12 days after fertilization.
### Embryo and Fetal Development
Once implanted, the zygote cells continue to rapidly divide through mitotic cell division to form a ball of cells called a **morula**. As cells continue specializing, a fluid-filled cavity forms and it is now called a **blastocyst**. The blastocyst undergoes further development and differentiation as it migrates deeper into the endometrium. An embryo is formed as the blastocyst forms three distinct layers that will give rise to various body structures and organs. Placenta development begins, providing nutrients and oxygen exchange between mother and fetus. As major organ systems form and develop through weeks 4-8, it is called the **fetal stage**. The fetus will continue to grow and develop further until childbirth.
### Heredity, Pregnancy and Childbirth 
During pregnancy, two sets of **human genetics** are passed on from the parents to the fetus as it develops. Physical traits, conditions, and dispositions can be inherited. Pregnancy lasts around 38 weeks and involves complex physiological changes sustained by the placenta. Near full term, a series of hormones cause the cervix to soften and dilate, signaling the start of labor. Powerful contractions of the uterus push the fetus through the birth canal in a process called **childbirth**. After birth, the umbilical cord is cut and the baby begins independent life breathing and eating on its own outside the womb. A new life is formed from the union of genes from two parents through the amazing process of human sexual reproduction.
### Speculation and Myths Surrounding the Obamas
Many unfounded rumors and conspiracy theories circulated regarding President Barack Obama and his family during his presidency. Some speculated that his wife, Michelle Obama, was biologically male based on still photos taken out of context. However, multiple videos clearly show Michelle Obama's feminine traits. While at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, a photo was spread showing what appeared to be a visible bulge under Michelle Obama's dress fabric. Upon reviewing actual video footage from the event, the bulge is not present and seems to have been caused by lighting or the dress pattern in the still photo alone. There is simply no credible evidence to support claims that either Barack or Michelle Obama are anything other than the family they present as. Unfortunately, unverified speculation was used as a political tool by some to undermine the legitimacy and credentials of America's first Black president and family.
### Human Sexual Reproduction - The Biological Facts
In this writing, I have aimed to inform about the scientifically established facts of human sexual reproduction through a combination of informative sources. The key biological processes from genetic recombination to fertilization, implantation, embryonic and fetal development were described. Inheritance of physical traits from two sets of parental genetics was discussed. The average progression and stages of pregnancy and childbirth were outlined. While rumors and unfounded speculation about public figures will always circulate publicly, the facts of human biology clearly show that Michelle Obama's feminine traits and the Obama family unit are consistent with typical human sexual reproduction and inherited physical traits. When assessing claims, it is wise to rely on verifiable evidence and accord with established scientific processes over unfounded rumors without credible proof or logical reasoning.
