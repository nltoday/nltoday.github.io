## The Strong Chinese Influences on Vietnamese Culture
Throughout its long history, Vietnamese culture has been strongly shaped by its powerful neighbor to the north, China. For over a thousand years, Vietnam was dominated by Chinese governments and absorbed many aspects of Chinese culture. 
**Cultural transmission through Confucianism.** Confucian philosophy became deeply ingrained in Vietnamese society and political structures during dynastic times. The Nguyen Dynasty emphasised maintaining Confucian traditions even as the philosophy fell out of favor in China.

**Language borrowing from ancient Chinese dialects.** Around 70% of Vietnamese vocabulary is derived from Chinese, mostly loans from the dialects of southern China during early Chinese rule. **Loanword influence Southern Chinese dialects**. While the grammar and sounds of the languages diverged, this massive linguistic influence is still visible today. 
**Adoption of Chinese administrative systems.** The imperial examination system and bureaucracy modeled on China's became standard. Vietnamese scholars studied Confucian classics to pass exams and join the government. **Scholar-official system administration structure**. 
### Chinese Influences on Art, Literature and Customs
Beyond government and learning, Chinese styles dominated other cultural domains as well. Architecture followed southern Chinese feng shui principles and ornamental designs. Traditional Vietnamese clothes mimicked Tang Dynasty imperial robes. Literature incorporated Chinese poetic forms like Tang shi and Nôm writing adapted Chinese characters. Even small gestures and behaviors associated with politeness drew from Chinese protocol. Over centuries of proximity and domination, Chinese influences permeated Vietnamese cultural practices and norms.

## Cultural Adaptation and Divergence from China 
While Chinese cultural predominance lasted over a millennium, Vietnamese identity did not simply mimic China. Cultural elements were selectively adopted and adapted to Vietnamese conditions. 
### Development of the Unique Vietnamese Language
Although based on ancient Chinese vocabs, Vietnamese evolved phonetic rules and grammars wholly unlike any Chinese dialect. The Nôm writing system bridged Chinese characters and native words, facilitating literacy without fully depending on Chinese. By the 20th century, a Latin-based orthography helped distance the modern Vietnamese identity from China. 
### Fusion of Chinese and Indigenous Belief Systems
Chinese Mahayana Buddhism got fused with earlier Vietnamese spiritual practices. Local gods were syncretized into the pantheon or worshipped separately in their own temples. Taoist thought also integrated myths of indigenous folk religions. This moderated the foreignness of Chinese imports. 
### Nationalism and Anti-Chinese Sentiments
As Chinese control waned, Vietnamese rulers asserted independence and unique cultural heritage. The 20th century saw strong nationalist movements emerge which sought to purge perceived foreign/Chinese influence. Communist rule after 1945 accelerated literacy in the Latin alphabet while downplaying Confucian ethics. However, Sino-Vietnamese amity has been restored more recently.
## Contemporary Cultural Connections and Differences
In the present, Vietnamese and Chinese cultures remain closely linked yet distinct. Some key aspects:
### Shared Philosophical and Aesthetic Influences 
Confucian ethics of filial piety and education still influence family and social values in both. Traditional arts like calligraphy, painting and poetry trace inspirations to common wellsprings despite divergent modern expressions. 
### Mutual Intelligibility between Languages Lost
While significant vocabularies overlap, the pronunciation systems and grammars of modern Standard Chinese and Vietnamese are **mutually unintelligible languages**. Ordinary communication requires translation or a third language. 
### Different Cuisines despite Common Ingredients  
Ingredients like rice, soy, vegetables and seafood form staples of both cuisines, but cooking styles and favorite dishes vary greatly. **Fusions inspired traveling gourmands**. Vietnam's signature dishes stand apart from Chinese counterparts.
### Economic and Political Relations Shape Perceptions
Periods of cooperation and recent border conflicts contributed to how citizens view their relationship. Now Vietnam-China trade and tourism are booming while historical misunderstandings gradually heal. 
### Preserving Cultural Heritage through Shared Rituals
Major Vietnamese and Chinese festivals maintain rituals brought centuries ago from the same religious traditions. Ceremonies honouring ancestors on Tết and Chung Yeung link the communities even across borders.
In conclusion, Vietnamese and Chinese civilizations have profoundly influenced each other for millennia through conquest, trade and simple proximity. While political relationships changed over time, cultural bonds endured and today a shared heritage complements unique national identities. Appreciating nuanced connections can enrich understanding between the peoples.
