### Learning the Basics
Of course you can host your own website from home on a budget. Don't let people discourage you from trying. Learn the basics such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript by writing simple websites and saving them to your computer. Use a free web server like Apache to view your sites locally hosted at `localhost:80`. If you can access your websites over localhost, you're ready for the next step of hosting them publicly online.

### Choosing an Operating System
There are several free and open source operating systems you can use to host your website from home. Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian and Fedora are all excellent choices for [web server operating systems](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-dad-sketch5645-t-shirt). I'd recommend choosing one of these Linux distributions over Windows for better stability and security as a web server. Download the ISO file, create a virtual machine using VirtualBox, and follow online tutorials to learn how to install and configure your chosen OS.
### Using a Control Panel
Once your Linux server is installed, install Webmin or a similar control panel to visually manage your server applications and services. Webmin gives you an easy graphical interface for common tasks like installing packages, managing users and configuring services. Review **digital ocean tutorials** on their website to learn how to set up and use programs like Apache, PHP, MySQL and more through your new control panel. 
### Securing Your Server
Before exposing your server to the public internet, make sure to properly secure it. Configure your firewall, **UFW**, to only allow necessary inbound ports. For a basic website, SSH (port 22) and HTTP/HTTPS (ports 80 and 443) should suffice. Generate and install SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt to encrypt your website traffic. Harden your server with security best practices and create strong passwords and authentication.
### Connecting to the Internet
With your server ready, the next step is connecting it to the internet. Forward the required ports on your home router to your server's private IP address. Set up dynamic DNS service like NO-IP so your domain always points to your changing public IP address. Your website will now be accessible from anywhere on the **public internet** at your domain name. 
### Enhancing Security
For added security, consider using a separate dedicated router just for your server. This isolates your home network in case your server is ever compromised. Monitor server logs and access patterns to detect any unauthorized intrusion attempts. Regularly apply security updates to keep your system fully patched. Above all, only expose what's absolutely necessary and remain vigilant about protecting your home network.
### Choosing a Hosting Option
If self-hosting at home doesn't meet your needs due to stability, reliability or technical constraints, consider low-cost hosting alternatives. Many web hosting providers offer basic shared hosting plans starting around $5 per month. For businesses or more complex sites, virtual private servers (VPS) at $10-20/month deliver more power and isolation. Allocate only what you need; a static HTML site could perform well even on basic shared hosting. Weigh your requirements versus potential risks of home hosting.
Overall, hosting your own website from home is perfectly doable on a low budget if you take the time to properly secure and configure your server installation. Start small, learn foundational skills, and consider upgrading hosting as your needs grow. With careful planning and maintenance, you can reliably host personal projects, blogs, basic storefronts or even development environments right from your own network.
