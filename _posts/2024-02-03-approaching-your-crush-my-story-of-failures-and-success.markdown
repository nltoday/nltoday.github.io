## Finding the Courage
I was nervous as I walked into my college for the fresher's day. As a shy person, large crowds intimidated me. But something caught my eye that day - a tall, dark and handsome guy greeting the newcomers. I was stunned by his charm and good looks. From that moment on, he became my [secret college crush](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-crass-christmas-gnome-matching-family-ugly-v-neck-t-shirt/men&). 
For the next few months, I would eagerly watch out for him during breaks between classes. Our eyes would sometimes meet from a distance but I never mustered the courage to go up and speak to him. All the what-ifs started playing in my head - what if he doesn't like me? what if he has a girlfriend? what if he thinks I'm weird? The anxiety took over and I would run away each time.
### Failed Attempts and Close Calls
A few chances did come up where I tried to initiate a conversation but something always went wrong. Once during a college festival, I finally built up the nerve to approach him. But his roommate spotted me from a distance and came over to chat. By the time he left, my crush had disappeared into the crowd. Another time, I waited outside his class hoping to walk with him but he suddenly left with some friends. It was so frustrating!
It seemed like fate did not want us to talk. Over time, word spread in our friend circles about my not-so-secret crush. Everyone knew except for him. I started losing hope that I'll ever be able to confess how I truly felt.

## Taking the Plunge
As our final semester drew to a close, I realised this could be my last chance to tell him before we all parted ways. On the day of our graduation ceremony, I psyched myself to just go for it regardless of the outcome. After the event, I anxiously searched the dispersing crowd for a glimpse of his face. 
Finally spotting him, I marched up with pounding heart, "Hi!" I said with a shaky voice. "Hi, oh I forgot your name, you are?" was his reply. In that moment, it sunk in that he did not even recognise me after over 1.5 years of studying in the same college. I was nobody to him. Never had I felt so small and invisible. With a forced smile and excuse, I quickly walked away fighting back tears. 
It was a harsh reality check but also a valuable learning experience. I realised my approach was wrong - I put him on a pedestal without truly knowing him. Staying shyly in the background got me nowhere.
## A Fresh Start
After a low phase of getting over the rejection, I was ready to try again - this time with a different strategy. When the new semester started, I vowed to introduce myself to my crush as a friend first before revealing my feelings. We shared some common interests so opening conversations was easier. I made efforts to chat with him regularly and know him better as a person.
Slowly, a close friendship started developing. I learned he was actually a shy, sensitive guy beneath the cool exterior. Our **meaningful conversations** ranged from college gossip to deeper discussions on life goals. My infatuation was transforming into genuine care and understanding for him as an individual. 
### Taking the Relationship Forward
A few months into our friendship, I sensed he was beginning to see me differently too. Small gestures like waiting for me after classes or walking back home together hinted he valued our bond. One movie night, as we lay chatting under the stars, a lull fell upon us. I turned to see him gazing softly at me, as if wanting to say something. In that tender moment, I decided to lay it all on the line.
"I really like you. More than a friend" I said, pouring my heart out. To my relief, he broke into a bashful smile and whispered "I feel the same way". Our hands found each other in the dark and a new chapter in our **romantic relationship** began. We've been dating blissfully for over two years now. That chance meeting transformed our lives.
## Lessons Learned Along the Way 
My story taught me valuable lessons about approaching crushes which I share for anyone in similar situations:
- Don't put them on an unrealistic pedestal based on looks alone. Get to know them as a real person first.
- Starting out as friends allows you to connect meaningfully without pressure before confessing feelings. 
- Have honest conversations to understand each other beyond surface level. **True bonds are built through quality time and deep discussions**.
- Takes courage to put yourself out there but staying silent ensures nothing will ever happen. Take the plunge but do it respectfully. 
- If rejected, don't lose hope. Learn and move forward in a positive manner. Your person could be just around the corner waiting to find you too.
With patience and by following the heart, desires of the soul often have a way of getting fulfilled. I'm glad I didn't give up on love and am thankful for the rich relationship I have today with my amazing partner. My story goes to show that with courage and honesty, approaching crushes can truly lead to beautiful things.
