### Rudder Pedals and Nose Wheel Steering 
One of the most common and widely used methods of steering aircraft on the ground is through the use of rudder pedals and nose wheel steering. On smaller aircraft, the nose wheel is directly connected to the rudder pedals through a mechanical linkage. Moving the rudder pedals left or right will cause the nose gear to turn in the corresponding direction, allowing the pilot to effectively steer the aircraft during taxi, takeoff, and landing operations. [Larger commercial and passenger aircraft](https://yt.io.vn/collection/akridge) typically employ a hydraulic nose wheel steering system. In this setup, a steering tiller or handle is used by the pilot to send hydraulic fluid to actuators that physically turn the nose gear. This provides more precise steering control, especially important at higher taxi speeds on big jets.

### Differential Braking for Steering 
A second technique involves the use of **differential braking steering**. Here, the nose wheel is free castering and not directly steered. Instead, pilots will apply unequal braking to the left and right main landing gears, causing the aircraft to turn in the direction of the braked wheels. This method is commonly found on military fighter jets and other aircraft without conventional steerable nose gears. It allows for nimble taxiing but requires more pilot input and coordination compared to nose wheel steering. Differential braking is also sometimes used by commercial pilots during landings in strong crosswinds or taxi situations requiring sharp turns where rudder pedal steering may be too coarse. 
### Taxi Steering Techniques Compared
Both rudder pedal steering and differential braking have their pros and cons for aircraft ground operations. Nose wheel steering provides a more intuitive single-control method suitable for most aircraft taxi needs. However, it does limit maximum steering angles and may be inappropriate for applications requiring extreme maneuverability on the ground like fighter jet operations. Differential braking, on the other hand, sacrifices ease of use but enables very tight turning radii that regular nose gear designs could not achieve. Higher pilot concentration is also needed to smoothly modulate the unequal braking. Overall, rudder pedal nose wheel steering remains the gold standard for airliners and general aviation thanks to its simplicity and suitability in most ground taxi situations.
### Differential Thrust Steering
A less common third technique involves the use of **differential thrust steering** unique to twin-engine aircraft. By independently varying the power levels of the two engines using their throttle levers, a pilot can vector the asymmetrical thrust to pivot the aircraft around its center of gravity on the ground. This method does not actually turn the aircraft's wheels but instead pushes it in the desired direction through engine force imbalance. However, differential thrust is rarely employed for regular taxiing. The engines are normally kept at low power settings during ground operations for fuel efficiency and noise abatement reasons, negating any significant steering capability. It may see some limited use during aborted takeoffs or on soft muddy fields where wheel mechanisms are compromised. Overall, differential thrust provides only marginal steering control in real taxi situations.
### Advanced Steering Systems 
As technology progresses, newer generations of aircraft are being outfitted with more advanced electronic steering control interfaces. Some business jets and airliners now feature fly-by-wire nose wheel steering systems controlled through a steering mode selector on the pilots' control yokes or sticks. Inputs are sent digitally to power steering actuators for smooth, responsive taxi performance. Some manufacturers have even introduced **tandem wheel main landing gear configurations** with independent braking and steering of each tandem pair for incredibly nimble ground handling. Looking ahead, researchers are exploring sensor fusion and autonomous taxi technologies. Future aircraft may one day be able to self-navigate airport terminals and taxiways via advanced driver-assistance systems.
### Summary of Aircraft Steering Methods
In summary, the three main techniques used by pilots for steering aircraft while taxiing on the ground are rudder pedal nose wheel steering, differential braking, and to a lesser extent differential thrust vectoring on twin-engine aircraft. Nose wheel steering is the simplest and most prevalent system found on most airplanes thanks to its intuitive single-control design. Differential braking enables very tight turns but requires more pilot input and coordination. Differential thrust produces only marginal steering due to low engine power during ground operations. Going forward, new aircraft will continue integrating more advanced computer-controlled steering interfaces and sensor fusion technologies for autonomous taxiing capabilities.
