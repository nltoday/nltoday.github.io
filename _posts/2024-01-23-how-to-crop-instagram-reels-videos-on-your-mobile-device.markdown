### Editing Reels Videos
Before posting videos as Reels on Instagram, it's best to do some editing within a dedicated video editing software on your desktop or laptop computer. This allows for more flexible and advanced editing than what's available directly within the Instagram app.
Some key reasons to edit video externally include being able to trim clips, add transitions, overlay text or graphics, adjust color and brightness, and crop the video frame. Cropping is important for Reels since these vertical videos are meant to be viewed full screen on mobile devices. Precise cropping helps ensure the entire composition is visible without distracting black bars.
Premiere Pro is a popular editing software that lets you add precise crop controls. You can resize and reposition the crop area using on-screen handles. Don't forget to scale the cropped video so it fully fills the intended aspect ratio without excess blank space after exporting your edited Reel. Export at the highest quality settings for optimal playback on Instagram.

### Cropping Reels Videos Within Instagram
While external video editing is preferable, it's still possible to do some basic cropping directly within the Instagram app on your mobile device. This comes in handy for tweaking Reels you previously uploaded. The built-in cropping tools may not offer pixel-precise control, but can work for minor adjustments.
To crop an existing Reel, open the app and navigate to your profile. Tap the "Reels" tab to see your created videos. Select the Reel you want to edit and hit the three dot menu icon. Choose "Edit Reel" then use a pinching gesture on the video preview to dynamically zoom and reframe the footage. 
As you pinch in or out, the cropped area will update in real-time. Make sure to frame your key [subjects and compositions](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-but-psycho-bae-darling-crazy-girlfriend-t-shirt/women&) in a way that best fills the vertical mobile aspect ratio. Be mindful not to accidentally cut off important visual elements. When satisfied, tap "Done" then "Save" to keep your changes.
### Instagram's Automatic Cropping 
A challenge with Reels is that Instagram sometimes automatically crops and scales videos during playback. This can unintentionally cut off parts of the frame depending on the viewer's device and app settings. Unfortunately, creators don't have direct control over how videos show up for each user.
The automatic cropping seems to be Instagram's way of avoiding letterboxing, or fitting non-native aspect ratio videos cleanly within its mobile interface. However, it robs video makers of pixel-perfect authority over framing and compositions. Many videographers find it frustrating, hoping Instagram will eventually provide users and artists more flexible options for managing aspect ratios in Reels and Stories. Overall cropping control remains an ongoing area for improvement within the platform.
So in summary - do fine-tuning edits and precise cropping outside of Instagram before upload whenever possible. And be mindful that your Reels may still be subject to unpredictable automatic scaling by the app itself once published. But with careful planning and composition tailored for mobile framing, you can still craft well-framed vertical videos within these system limitations.
