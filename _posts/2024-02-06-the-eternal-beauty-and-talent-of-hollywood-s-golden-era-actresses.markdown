### Hollywood's Most Iconic Sex Symbol
Marilyn Monroe is undoubtedly one of the most enduring and iconic actresses from Hollywood's Golden Era. Even decades after her untimely death at the young age of 36, she is still remembered worldwide for her winsome embodiment of a Hollywood sex symbol. [Platinum blonde bombshell Marilyn Monroe](https://yt.io.vn/collection/ackman) rose to fame in a series of comedy and musical roles in the 1950s, wooing audiences with her breathy voice, coy smile and hourglass figure. However, behind the glittering facade of immense stardom, Marilyn struggled greatly with mental health issues and dependence on drugs during her career, a reflection of the personal troubles she faced in life off-screen.

### An Accessible and Fun-Loving Actress 
While Marilyn Monroe achieved iconic status as a screen goddess and sex symbol, some felt that her contemporary and co-star Jane Russell had a more magnetic screen presence. Russell exhibited a down-to-earth charm and wit that made her seem more **"accessible, less self-absorbed."** Unlike the troubled Marilyn, Russell appeared to genuinely enjoy her career and took the humor in her roles in stride. She was also a very **talented singer and dancer** in addition to her acting skills. Jane Russell brought lively energy and comedic timing to her roles alongside leading men like Marilyn, outshining the more fragile Monroe on occasion with her vivacious spirit.
### Tragic Beauty Cut Down Too Soon
Among the many beautiful celebrities of Hollywood's Golden Era, one stands out as uniquely tragic - **Sharon Tate**. With her **ethereal, angelic beauty**, Tate rose to fame in the 1960s and gave off an **exceptionally warm, kind-hearted persona** off-screen according to those who knew her. Tragically, the young actress was murdered at the peak of her blossoming career by the Manson family cult in 1969. Her brutal killing, while eight months pregnant, was especially horrific given her reputation for **universally beloved personality and sweet nature**. The senselessness of Tate's murder marked it as a profound tragedy that still haunts Hollywood to this day.
### Olivia de Havilland's Enduring Classic Beauty
Another actress who exemplified **classic Hollywood beauty** with a long and storied career was Olivia de Havilland. De Havilland forged an **iconic on-screen partnership with Errol Flynn** in several swashbuckling films for Warner Bros. in the 1930s-1940s that helped elevate her to major stardom. However, she demonstrated her remarkable range and commitment to her craft by famously "de-glamming" herself for complex, unglamorous roles as needed. This was best seen in William Wyler's 1949 psychological drama _The Heiress_, where the "most beautiful woman in the world" played an **undesirable wallflower**. Director Wyler noted even their best efforts couldn't diminish de Havilland's mesmerizing beauty. She continued radiating poise and charm into old age, living an impressive 104 years.
### James Cagney's Favorite Co-Star
Legendary Hollywood tough guy James Cagney had high praise for one actress in particular when discussing his most beautiful co-stars - Olivia de Havilland. Cagney loved de Havilland's ability to transform completely between roles, going from a winsome belle like **Abby Irving in the Western Dodge City** to the repressed spinster **Catherine Sloper in The Heiress**. De Havilland always submerged herself fully into even the most unglamorous of parts for the sake of her art. She remained striking well into her later years, pictured with an Oscar-winning David Lean and Sam Spiegel at the 1963 Academy Awards looking as gorgeous as ever in her prime. 
### Glamorous Goddess with Substance
While de Havilland radiated old Hollywood glamour and sophistication on the surface as one of the **last remaining Golden Era stars**, she proved there was substance behind the beauty. She broke off an engagement with Jimmy Stewart seeing he wasn't ready to commit, rejected the advances of a young John F. Kennedy, and even caused a legendary fist fight between Errol Flynn and John Huston when the latter disparaged her. De Havilland also fought the restrictive studio system through a landmark legal case that helped end the unfair contract system that had trapped many stars. This demonstrated her to be an elegant but formidable woman who would not simply defer to men or the industry establishment.
### A Long and Remarkable Life
The prolific Olivia de Havilland truly lived an remarkable lifespan worthy of her status as a Hollywood icon. She passed away in Paris at the **age of 104** still fiercely independent with her faculties intact to the end. De Havilland outlived most of her Golden Era peers and contemporaries, bearing witness to over a century of change. Throughout her many roles, she always imbued her characters with an intrinsic **humanity, depth and vulnerability** beyond mere appearances. This was likely part of what allowed de Havilland to stay creatively relevant for so long in contrast to mere "starlets" of shorter lived fame. Her enduring legacy and elegant face continue inspiring generations of film lovers decades after her final acclaimed performance.
### Hollywood's Most Talented Actresses 
While physical beauty was prized in Hollywood's studio system heyday, the most celebrated actresses of the time like Olivia de Havilland, Jane Russell and the tragic Sharon Tate demonstrated true multidimensional talent that has kept their stars shining even today. They brought profound depth, complexity and humor to their roles beyond just looks. De Havilland in particular showed remarkable range and perseverance through her landmark career spanning over 75 years.   Though lesser-known stars have long faded, these select few remain ingrained in our cultural memories for leaving behind more than just a lovely face - but a legacy of exceptional artistic ability and humanity that has lasted lifetimes.
