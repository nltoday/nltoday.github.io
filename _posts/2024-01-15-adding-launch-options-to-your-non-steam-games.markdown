Optimizing your PC gaming experience doesn't need to stop once you exit Steam. While the popular game launcher makes it straightforward to modify settings through launch parameters, you aren't restricted to only tweaking Steam titles. With a few simple steps, you can take control of your non-Steam games as well. 
### Customizing from the Desktop 
A convenient starting point is utilizing desktop shortcuts. Right-click on an executable's shortcut and select Properties. Within the Target path, add your options after a space. For example, **"C:\Path\to\Game.exe" -fullscreen -novid**. Click Apply to save the customized shortcut.

### Leveraging Game Launchers
Many third-party stores like the Epic Games Store integrate their own frontends. Access the game's settings through its library page. For [Epic Games Store](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-king-chihuahua-wearing-crownqueen-chihuahua-dog-302-chihuahua-dog) titles, find Additional Command Line Arguments under the options menu. **Ubisoft Connect** properties allow modifying Game launch arguments.
### Improving Performance with Parameters
Stuttering and lag can ruin immersion. Two effective parameters for boosting **frame rate optimization** are **-lowmemory** and **-dxlevel 90**. The first lightens memory load, while the latter forces older DirectX versions for more compatibility. Two longer launch options worth trying are:
- **-exthreads=1** — Reduces CPU overhead for single-core optimized games by disabling multithreading. Improves smoothness on some CPUs. 
- **-d3d10** or **-d3d11** — Forces the game to use Direct3D 10 or 11 respectively, which may provide better performance than default settings on some hardware.
### Altering Graphics through Options 
Not all PCs can handle maxed out eye candy. Adjusting visuals optimizes the experience for your rig. Common settings involve **graphics quality \-high \-low**, **resolution \-1024x768**, and **anti-aliasing \-noaa**. The **\-windowed** parameter runs the game in a resizeable window instead of fullscreen for improved multitasking.
### Digging into Configuration Files 
For the most advanced tweaks, some titles store parameter-driven configuration files. Locate these in installation folders, My Documents, or appdata to manually edit settings. Carefully back up originals first in case errors occur. Community wikis often outline game-specific files and tweaks.
With a little know-how, you can enhance non-Steam games beyond their default experiences. Take the reins by leveraging options through desktop shortcuts, third-party launchers, or configuration files tailored for your hardware. Fine-tuning graphics, performance, and more unlocks a more customized and optimized gaming experience.
