## A Rocky Start  
For the longest time, I struggled to find my passion. I went through several major changes in college before discovering my true calling. It was a winding road, but those unexpected turns led me somewhere I never could have imagined.
In high school, I was always interested in science and math. I started college as a chemistry major because I enjoyed those subjects in school. However, it didn't take long to realize lab work was not for me. I didn't have the patience or attention to detail needed. Looking for a new direction, I explored engineering but found it boring. 
### A New Discovery
One required course caught my eye - [Introduction to Computer Science](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/alban). Having no programming experience, I had to work extra hard to catch up. But I enjoyed the logical problem solving. That sparked my interest to change majors. Despite objections, I pursued a degree in **computer science** instead.

## Gaining Valuable Real-World Experience  
To make my degree more applicable, I added a second major in business management. I wanted to understand how technology could benefit organizations. During summers, I looked for jobs giving me business exposure. One role let me see how a large company operated from the inside.
### Lessons Learned the Hard Way
Unfortunately, after graduation I took a job that was not a good cultural fit. I also lacked business depth from squeezing two majors into four years. Seeking a fresh start, I decided an MBA could fill gaps in my education. The degree broadened my understanding of management principles.
## Finding My Passion's Purpose
With more well-rounded training, I felt ready to apply my skills where they could make the most impact. I wanted to use technology to solve important problems. Through my new connections, I learned about promising areas like artificial intelligence and biotechnology.
### Tackling Challenges in Healthcare  
Healthcare presented massive challenges but also great opportunities to innovate. I was particularly drawn to efforts using data science and machine learning for medical research. Specifically, neuroscience captivated me with its potential to cure conditions like paralysis. My personal experience with a spinal injury added motivation to contribute. I felt passionately that technology could help accelerate discovery of new treatments.
## Pursuing My Dream
With a clear purpose in mind, I searched for the right opportunity. I wanted a position letting me directly apply data-driven solutions. I also sought an environment optimizing resources for high-risk, high-reward projects. I found the perfect fit at a leading research hospital known for groundbreaking work in areas like genomics and regenerative medicine.
### Taking the Next Step
I joined a multi-disciplinary team focused on developing AI tools for spinal injury research. Using cutting-edge techniques like deep learning, we aim to gain new biological insights that could enable novel therapies. It is rewarding to spend my career working towards cures that might have helped me. I am grateful every day to be pursuing my true passion in a way that could make a meaningful difference for so many others. What started as a winding journey has led me precisely where I am meant to be.
## Looking Toward the Future
There is still so much work to be done, but I am optimistic about the possibilities. With continued progress in fields like nanotechnology, stem cell research and tissue engineering, I believe we will find ways to reverse damage once thought permanent. My goal is to stay at the forefront of these advances, helping bring cutting-edge medical technologies from the laboratory to patients. I plan to dedicate my career to fueling breakthroughs that could restore independence and mobility for millions affected by spinal cord and other neurological injuries. Through perseverance and partnership across disciplines, I am confident we will get closer to real cures with each new discovery. My passion is just beginning.
In summary, while my original aspirations changed course several times, each twist and turn pointed me toward my true calling. By staying open to new opportunities and willing to adapt, I found a way to unite my interests in computers, healthcare and helping others. My journey shows that with patience and persistence, it is possible to turn a winding road into the path leading precisely where you are meant to be.
