### Choosing the Right Degree and Campus Life  
I myself attended Royal Holloway, University of London from 2010â€“2013 to complete my Bachelor's degree in History. It was one of the best decisions I ever made. The university offers a supportive learning environment where staff are always willing to help students succeed. As a student, I found my history tutors to be extremely helpful, answering any questions I had after lectures and seminars. This level of support helped me get ahead in my studies. 
The campus itself is beautiful, set within picturesque Surrey countryside just outside of London. While not within London itself, the university is still very accessible via **40-minute train rides** into Waterloo station. Students have the benefit of quiet suburban surroundings while still being able to access all that the big city has to offer. Living on or near campus my first two years, I truly appreciate the tight-knit community feeling at Royal Holloway.

### World-Class Academic Programs and Support 
After completing my first degree, I went on to study for a **Law degree (LLB)** at the University of Birmingham. There, I noticed the support was not on the same level as Royal Holloway. One tutor even flat out refused an extra piece of work I wanted to submit before exams. This showed me the value of attending a university with staff dedicated to helping students succeed. 
Royal Holloway offers rigorous academic programs across a wide range of subjects. While some course materials may seem slightly dated, the quality of teaching makes up for it. Tutors are extremely supportive and help students get the most from their education. A degree from Royal Holloway is highly respected globally. Distance learning students also receive excellent support, regardless of their location. The university's commitment to students is clear.
### Modern Accommodation Options on Campus
Living on campus enhances the student experience, and Royal Holloway has various high-quality housing options. Newly constructed residences like Williamson Hall are absolutely stunning, offering en-suite bedrooms and state-of-the-art amenities, though fees are high. Other desirable options include Gowar Hall, Wedderburn Hall and Butler Hall for well-appointed living spaces near campus facilities. Tuke Hall is also good. Kingswood Hall is quite far from classes but builds a tight-knit community among residents. Living off-campus my second year in nearby Englefield Green village was one of the best times of my life. Proximity to campus is important for convenience.
### Robust Student Life Despite Isolation  
Nightlife is somewhat limited due to the campus' isolated suburban location outside London. Local options include clubs in nearby towns like Windsor and Staines, as well as the university's own student union bar. However, Royal Holloway's smaller size fosters strong bonds between students. Residential communities and societies help combat any feelings of isolation. London is also easily accessible for cultural enrichment when desired. Overall campus life provides treasured memories to last a lifetime.
### Visiting is Highly Recommended
Prospective students should experience Royal Holloway's beautiful campus and welcoming atmosphere firsthand. Open days provide a guided overview of facilities and a chance to ask current students about their experiences. Be sure to visit academic departments of interest too, as standards may vary. Speaking with professors can help determine if their teaching approach is a good fit. A visit will help decide if Royal Holloway's tight-knit supportive community and excellent education are right for your goals and learning style.
### An Unforgettable Alma Mater  
In conclusion, Royal Holloway delivered some of the best years of my life. The combination of top-notch academics, supportive staff, beautiful grounds and livable suburban location made it the perfect choice for my undergraduate and graduate studies. While other universities may have been reasonable options, I would not hesitate to recommend Royal Holloway or choose it again myself given the opportunity. Its size fosters a priceless personal touch difficult to find elsewhere. Prospective students seeking an unforgettable university experience need look no further.
