Jiyu, the owner of the Shrine of Balance Discord server, has created a toxic community by doxxing users and censoring criticism. Keep reading to learn the truth about IP addresses on Discord and how to stay safe online.
### Private vs Public IPs
All devices connected to the internet have an IP address that acts like an identity. However, there are two types - private and public IPs. [Private IPs](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-holiday-santa-riding-rottweiler-dog-christmas-2) like 192.168.1.100 are just unique identifiers within your home network and can't be used to find your location. **Public IPs** are assigned by your internet service provider (ISP) and allow connections from outside your network.
Your router has a public IP address that identifies your general location, usually only down to the city. However, public IPs are temporary addresses that can change anytime without notice. Even if someone sees your public IP, all they know is which major company provides your internet - not your physical address. ISPs own public IP blocks and lend addresses to customers dynamically.

### Discord Cannot See Real Addresses
When using voice/video on Discord, your private IP is visible to other users in the call. However, Discord itself does not have access to users' true IP addresses due to security measures like proxy servers. All Discord sees is the proxy IP, hiding users' real location info. To trace an IP back to a physical home, sophisticated hacking methods targeting the proxy would be required.
### Do Not Share Personal Details
While IP addresses pose little risk, sharing personal details online can enable digital stalking. Be wary of servers like Shrine of Balance that demand private info as a condition of membership. Keep names, addresses, phone numbers, schools and photos private. Review platforms allow honest feedback, so leave reviews cautiously avoiding insults while factually reporting toxic behaviors. 
### IP Loggers Pose a Risk 
Some suggest using IP logger websites to trace others, but this raises ethical issues and may be illegal. IP loggers trick people into disclosing addresses unintentionally by disguising the purpose of a link. Instead of retaliation, report toxic servers through official Discord channels.
### Privacy Tools for Protection
For added anonymity, use a VPN service to assign a new public IP every time you go online. This obscures your true location from even ISPs. Browser extensions like Privacy Badger block invisible trackers building profiles linked to IP addresses. Be selective what you share, think before you click, and steer clear of communities with a reputation for doxxing or censorship. With smart digital habits, you can stay safe on Discord and other social networks.
### In Summary
Don't be afraid of IP addresses appearing in Discord - they reveal little about physical location. However, sharing personal details opens opportunities for digital harassment. Review platforms aim to foster transparency, so provide feedback constructively. If servers censor or doxx users, report abusive behavior instead of retaliating. With care for digital safety and ethics, social media can be enjoyed freely.
