### Recognizing My Body Type  
As someone who has always struggled to gain weight naturally, I realized I identified as an [ectomorph body type](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-holiday-party-this-is-my-bernard-dog-christmas-pajama-2). Growing up, I was constantly told by family members to "eat more" and accused of not eating enough. No matter how much I ate, it was difficult for me to gain weight. I also dealt with food allergies and gastrointestinal issues that made it even harder.

### Dealing with Negative Comments
Being skinny often led to more unsolicited criticism compared to those who were overweight. People felt comfortable making comments about how tiny or underweight I looked. While shopping, cashiers would remark on the size of my food purchases as if I couldn't possibly eat it all. These constant remarks chipped away at my self-esteem over time. Even when trying to gain muscle through protein shakes and weight training, I'd lose progress due to stomach issues from the supplements. Photos online where people thought I looked like a boy due to my slim frame only amplified my insecurities. 
### Accepting My Natural Body Type
After years of trying different diets and workout plans hoping to gain weight, I realized I needed to accept my **natural ectomorph body type**. Comparing myself to curvier fashion trends was counterproductive. While some days I still struggled with negative comments, surrounding myself with supportive people who loved me for who I was helped boost my confidence. Tracking my calorie-dense diet of 3000 calories showed I was fueling my body properly without overeating. I learned to find styles that celebrated my slender frame rather than trying to hide it.
### Focusing on Overall Health Over Appearance
Rather than obsess over the number on the scale, I prioritized listening to my body and focusing on overall wellness. Consistently fueling myself and strength training and yoga helped me feel energized instead of chronically fatigued. Tracking body composition showed I was gradually gaining **lean muscle mass** even if the numbers didn't change dramatically on the scale. Mental health is just as important, so I sought counseling to process body image issues. Surrounding myself with empowering content on social media featuring all body types helped reshape my perspective.  
### Embracing my Unique Appearance
While society often glorifies one body type over others, I chose to embrace my naturally slim build. Being under 100 pounds has never defined my self-worth, and I reject the idea that one must look a certain way to be taken seriously or desirable. My frame allows me to wear styles others can't pull off as easily. More important than numbers on a scale is being happy and healthy inside. I encourage others to focus less on comparing themselves and more on appreciating their own uniqueness. True beauty radiates from within regardless of dress size or measurements.
### Paying it Forward
Now when I encounter others facing struggles with body image or unhealthy relationships with food, I try to offer compassion and perspective. Negative thoughts are so easy to internalize, but speaking life and confidence into someone else can make a world of difference. I appreciate those in my life who supported me through my own journey and hope to do the same for others. My story shows that what really matters is finding peace within yourself, no matter your natural shape or size.
