### Condition and Tags
A Beanie Baby's condition is very important to its value. Beans still in their original packaging with swing tags attached will command the highest prices. Loose beans, even if in good condition otherwise, are worth less.

However, well-loved beans with missing tags have only sentimental value.
### Manufacturing Details
When and where a bean was made influences its rarity and desirability. There were **two different production periods** for Princess Diana bears, with slight variations in their "tush tags." Tags from one period are more sought-after. Minor tag or stitching flaws from the manufacturing process can also increase a rare bean's value for error collectors. Understanding minting specifics aids in proper valuation.
### Current Selling Prices  
To appraise a bean's current fair market value, research recent sold prices on auction sites like eBay. **Princess Diana Beanie Baby prices** naturally spiked around anniversary dates but now typically sell for under $10 in good condition. Steeply inflated asking prices don't reflect what buyers are willing to pay long-term. Price guides should reflect realistic transaction amounts, not optimistic listing costs.
### Error Beans May Be Worth More
While common Princess Diana Beanie Babies hold little monetary worth nowadays, error specimens with misprints, missing parts or unusual pellet stuffing could appeal more to specialized collectors. The rarest errors in pristine condition may command higher bids, sometimes into the hundreds of dollars, from error aficionados. But the majority retain memorabilia value rather than monetary value.
### Collector Interest Drives Prices 
After Diana's passing, anything commemorating her skyrocketed due to public fascination. This included Beanie Babies among numerous tribute items. Two decades later, the fervor has died down, lowering prices from their peak. Collector markets fluctuate with trends, and inflated estimates don't consider temperance over time. Regularly tracking sold comparable pieces gives the clearest picture of realistic prices according to present interest levels.
### Value is Subjective
Ultimately, an item's worth relies on finding a motivated buyer. Common Diana bears at thrift shops for under $5 show steady prices. But one man's "trash" could be another's treasure. Sentimental attachments give memorabilia extra meaning regardless of dollar figures. For avid collectors, condition, errors and other niche attributes may make some specimens especially prized. There are always exceptions to estimated values in the non-regulated collector marketplace.
### Conclusion
Many factors affect a Princess Diana Beanie Baby's value from era to era. Proper research into manufacturing details, condition, current sales comparisons, collector interest cycles and error varieties provides the best approach for fair appraisal. While monetary worth fluctuates, these beans remain treasured pop culture relics of 1990s cultural fixation on the people's princess, whether in a collection or kept for sentiment alone.
