### Early Life in the Smith Family
Joseph Smith Jr. was born in 1805 in Sharon, Vermont to Joseph Smith Sr. and Lucy Mack Smith. From a young age, Joseph showed signs of great spiritual gifts. When he was around 14 years old, Joseph began to have powerful visions. In one early vision, an angel named Moroni appeared to Joseph and told him about a collection of golden plates buried in a hill near Manchester, New York. These plates contained the record of ancient inhabitants of the Americas, known today as the Book of Mormon. 
Over the next several years, Moroni appeared to Joseph several times, instructing him on his mission to translate the plates. Eventually in 1827, Joseph was allowed to obtain the plates from the hill, dubbed [Cumorah](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/ahlers). Using special **interpreters** called the Urim and Thummim, Joseph translated the reformed Egyptian characters on the plates into English by the gift and power of God. During the translation process, Joseph was aided by several **scribes**, including Martin Harris and Oliver Cowdery.

### The Testimony of the Three Witnesses
Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris were known as the Three Witnesses, as they each testified that an angel showed them the golden plates. In 1829, Joseph, Oliver, David, and Martin went to a place where the plates were hidden. There they witnessed a glorious vision, as recounted in their written testimony: 
"An angel of God came down from heaven, and he brought and laid before our eyes...that we beheld and saw the plates." They testified in their written and spoken words that they saw and handled the plates. Even after some left the church later in life, all three consistently affirmed the reality of their experience to their death. Their powerful testimony is included in every copy of the Book of Mormon.
### The Eight Witnesses
In addition to the Three Witnesses, there were also Eight Witnesses - Christian Whitmer, Jacob Whitmer, Peter Whitmer Jr., John Whitmer, Hiram Page, Joseph Smith Sr., Hyrum Smith, and Samuel H. Smith. Unlike the Three Witnesses who saw the plates with their "spiritual eyes", the Eight Witnesses testified that Joseph Smith showed them the actual plates. In their written testimony, they affirm that "Joseph Smith Jr. has shown unto us the plates...and as many of the leaves as the said Smith has translated we did handle with our hands." This powerful independent testimony from multiple witnesses with nothing to gain strengthened the credibility of Joseph's work.
### Translation and Publication of the Book
With the help of his scribes, Joseph spent approximately 65 working days translating the plates between April and June of 1829. He would read off the translation which was then written down by his scribe. Martin Harris acted as Joseph's first scribe, transcribing 116 manuscript pages which were subsequently lost. Oliver Cowdery then took over as scribe, assisted by a few others at times such as Emma Hale Smith and John and Christian Whitmer. By the summer of 1829, Joseph and his scribes had completed the translation. 
In March 1830, the first 5,000 copies of the Book of Mormon were published by E.B. Grandin in Palmyra, New York. Initial reaction was mixed - while some were curious and receptive, many others were skeptical or hostile due to the claims of the book. Nevertheless, the Book of Mormon was established through the testimony of multiple reliable witnesses as a legitimate record of prophecies and peoples, which contained the fulness of Christ's everlasting gospel.
### Continuing Revelations and Expansion of the Church
On April 6, 1830, Joseph and a small group of believers formally organized The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Fayette, New York. Over the next few years, the Church grew rapidly as Joseph continued to receive revelations and restore Church organization and priesthood authority. Early members including Oliver Cowdery and the Whitmer family traveled across New York and Pennsylvania sharing their testimony of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon and the restored Church. 
By 1831, missionaries like Parley P. Pratt had begun preaching in the western states like Ohio. That summer Joseph and other Church leaders began journeying further west, eventually establishing Church headquarters in Kirtland, Ohio. There Joseph received many additional revelations and members experienced spiritual outpourings including visions, healings and speaking in tongues. Meanwhile the Book of Mormon continued to gain believers and influence as more copies were distributed. Within a few short years, the Church had expanded greatly through the powerful testimonies of witnesses to the Book of Mormon and the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.
### The Continued Legacy of Witnesses 
While the Three and Eight Witnesses encountered critics and adversities in later years, none ever denied or retracted their affirmations that they physically saw and handled the golden plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated. Their written and spoken testimonies endure today in every copy of the Book of Mormon, bearing powerful independent witness of its authenticity as a volume of ancient American scripture. For over 190 years since its publication, the Book of Mormon has transformed the lives of millions through its message of faith in Jesus Christ.
The living witnesses like Oliver Cowdery and members of the Whitmer and Smith families who helped bring forth and establish the Church in those earliest days left a legacy of committed discipleship. Descendants of the original witnesses continue to help spread the gospel worldwide as faithful members of the Latter-day Saint faith. Through the testimonies handed down, believers find convincing evidence that God called prophets in this final age to usher in His marvelous work and a wonder. Truly the golden plates and multiple witnesses who bore record of them stand as an enduring sign of the restoration of all things through the Church of Jesus Christ.
