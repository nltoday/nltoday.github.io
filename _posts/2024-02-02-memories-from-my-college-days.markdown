### Fateful Night in the Snow
I was living at the Sigma Chi fraternity house during my sophomore year of college in 1978. One snowy afternoon, the snowfall had reached over 30 inches. Classes were cancelled due to the blizzard. With no schoolwork to occupy our time, some of the restless brothers started challenging each other to jump out the second floor window into the accumulating snow drifts, which seemed thick enough to safely break their falls. However, as more people joined in, the jumps grew more daring. People started leaping from the third floor window into the same packed-down spot. Before long, 15 or so frat brothers had braved that jump. You could see where this was headed - up to the even higher floors.

### A Terrible Accident
I tried talking some sense into the thrill-seekers, cautioning them of the growing compaction of the snow below. But not all listened. One friend, a kind [graduate student](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/alcorta) at our prestigious university, decided to take the leap from the fourth floor. He landed hard in the icy snowpack. Though he motioned for others to stop, another daredevil jumped. To my horror, he sat stunned in the snow, unable to feel his legs below. An ambulance soon arrived to take the injured man to the hospital, where he would remain paralyzed for life due to the accident. Even today, I'm haunted by seeing the impact of that reckless choice and how it forever changed his future.
### Romantic Betrayal at the Game  
A few years later while working at my local Costco warehouse, I became familiar with the sad story of Bob and Mary. Bob, the grocery department manager, was gruff and unpopular with his employees. Sweet Mary stayed with him despite his poor treatment of others. One weekend, Bob shamelessly flaunted his infidelity with a young sample girl at our store. Furious, Mary threw all his belongings out on the lawn when he returned home. Their argument turned physical, and Mary defended herself, calling the authorities. Bob's downward spiral had just begun.
### Losing it All in One Night
That evening, in a drunken rage fueled by broken heart and pride, Bob drove to confront the "snitch" he assumed ruined his relationship - our co-worker Gary. Without cause, Bob burst into Gary's housewarming party and broke his nose with a single punch. Arrested that night for assault and drunk driving, Bob showed up to work the next day only to receive his termination. As one friend aptly summed up, "All that for a 19 year old with a fat butt and twins." Bob's bad choices led to losing the love of his life, home, job, freedom, and respect in just one night.
### Lessons Learned the Hard Way   
These stories from my college days and early career serve as sobering lessons. While youth brings temptation to test limits, lives can change in an instant from reckless actions. True character emerges in how we treat others, especially those closest to our hearts. Greed and desires for fleeting pleasures often blind us from valuing what really matters - our health, relationships, freedom and integrity. May we learn from costly mistakes not our own, and conduct ourselves with care, wisdom and compassion.
