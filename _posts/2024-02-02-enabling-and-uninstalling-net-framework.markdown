### Understanding the basics of .NET framework
.NET framework addresses common challenges faced by developers when building long-running applications. Originally, such applications were created using system assembler which involved writing redundant code for tasks like memory management, logging, and multi-tasking. 
Developers at one company addressed this by creating an "Activity Control Environment" or ACE framework in assembler to reuse such common code. This paved the way for modern frameworks like .NET which further abstract away such tasks by using Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL). MSIL allows compilers for languages like C

# and VB to generate code that integrates seamlessly within .NET's common runtime.
### Benefits of using a framework like .NET
Using a framework like .NET provides several key advantages over developing applications from scratch. It saves developers from reinventing the wheel by providing robust and **battle-tested** libraries for common tasks. Once familiar with .NET, skills are transferable across projects. The framework can also be extended through an **ever-growing** collection of third-party libraries. 
Powerful integrated development environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio are built around .NET, improving productivity. Memory and other resource management issues are avoided through features like automatic garbage collection. Mature frameworks also improve code quality due to extensive testing over the years in real-world projects.
### Enabling .NET Framework 3.5 using Server Manager
To enable .NET Framework 3.5 on Windows Server 2012 R2 or higher, use the Add Roles and Features Wizard accessible via Server Manager. Select the "Role-based or feature-based installation" type and check the box for ".NET Framework 3.5 Features" on the features selection screen. 
Provide an [alternate installation path](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-holiday-funny-santa-shetland-sheepdog-christmas-tree-2) if the server lacks access to Windows Update by specifying the path to the "\sources\sxs" folder on the installation media. For a remote server, the system account of the target machine requires access rights to the specified folder. Finally, click "Install" to complete the process.
### Uninstalling .NET framework versions
While not generally recommended, there may be situations requiring a full removal or reinstallation of .NET framework. To uninstall newer versions, open “Programs and Features” from Control Panel and uninstall items starting with “Microsoft .NET” in descending version order. 
Older versions built into the operating system itself may not be removable. To disable these, open the “Turn Windows features on or off” option and deselect relevant items like “.NET Framework 3.5”. A reboot is advised after making these changes.
### Issues that may arise during uninstallation
Completely uninstalling .NET framework carries risks like breaking applications relying on its components. Significant application changes may be required to operate without .NET. There is also a possibility of inconsistencies if only some framework versions are removed while others remain.
It is usually preferable to upgrade or repair an existing .NET installation over full uninstallation. Consider alternative options like installing a newer version alongside the existing one if just trying to add newer capabilities. A virtual machine setup can also help test framework uninstallation without compromising the host system.
### When a fresh installation may be preferable
In some cases such as a clean development environment, migrating to a different operating system, or troubleshooting hard-to-reproduce bugs, a fresh .NET framework installation may prove better than repairs. 
Before proceeding, carefully evaluate dependencies and thoroughly test applications. Create backups and plan changes needed to build without .NET if required. Incremental steps can help minimize risks - installing a newer version first before removing existing ones, for example.
With proper planning and testing, a full .NET removal and fresh setup provides a clean slate for development or issues requiring a "factory reset" kind of solution. But it should only be attempted if absolutely necessary after exhausting gentler options.
