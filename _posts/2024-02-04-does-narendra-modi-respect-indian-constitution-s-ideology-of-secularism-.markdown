Secularism has always been a complex topic in Indian politics. In this article, we will explore Narendra Modi's views on secularism based on Dr. Balaji Viswanathan's analysis on Quora:
### Dropping Demands for Leaders to be Agnostic
As Dr. Balaji pointed out, it is pointless and against the spirit of the Indian Constitution to demand that political leaders need to be agnostic or atheist. **As individuals, all citizens including political leaders have the freedom to practice any religion according to Article 25 of the Indian Constitution**. As long as the [Indian government does not mandate any particular religious texts in its offices](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/abril), the personal faith of leaders should not be an issue.

### Examples from Other Democracies 
Leaders from many major democracies openly practice the majority religions of their countries. For example, **United States presidents openly attend Christian churches**. The **Prime Minister of Israel Netanyahu participates in traditional Jewish ceremonies**. **Japanese Prime Minister Abe has met with Buddhist monks**. So expecting Indian leaders to be completely secular is unreasonable.
### Bhagavad Gita as India's Philosophical Treasure  
**Bhagavad Gita is considered one of the greatest philosophical works of India that transcends religious boundaries**. Non-Hindus both in India and abroad appreciate its teachings on life's dilemmas and duties. When Modi gifted the Gita, he gifted a commentating written by Mahatma Gandhi, who was not a religious figure but the Father of the Nation. **So gifting a text like the Gita should not be considered as promoting communalism**.
### Suitability and Personal Preferences in Gift Giving
When giving gifts to other leaders, **it is natural for the giver to consider the suitability and their own preferences**. Unless the gifts openly promote a particular religious doctrine over others, **sharing philosophical works rooted in one's own culture should not be controversial**. **Criticizing gifts without proper understanding of the texts often stems from lack of knowledge rather than secularism**.
### Multi-interpretability of Religious Scriptures 
**Religious scriptures often have deeper layers of meaning beyond superficial religious associations**. For example, **the Gita discusses concepts like duty, non-violence and self-control that apply to all humanity rather than just Hindus**. **Observing life's dilemmas from a spiritual lens makes its teachings relevant for both believers and non-believers**. **Labeling such nuanced texts as "communal" often betrays narrow thinking.**
### Compatibility of Personal Faith and Secular Governance
While having personal beliefs, **a leader can still ensure equal treatment and protection of all religions under his governance following the principles of secularism**. Unless personal views **negatively impact policy decisions or curb religious freedom enshrined in the Constitution, there is no contradiction between the two**. **Simplistic associations of secularism with atheism misrepresents the tolerance and plurality India's freedom of religion aims to foster.**
In conclusion, **applying simplistic labels of communalism or secularism without considering the complex nuances often clouds meaningful discussion** on this sensitive issue. **A balanced and inclusive approach that respects both personal faith and constitutional principles of equality is needed to properly analyze Narendra Modi's views on secularism.**
