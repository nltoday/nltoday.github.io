### Beyond Surface-Level Judgments
Many dismiss ballet as an effeminate activity unsuitable for boys and men. However, ballet requires immense physical strength and discipline. Beyond lifting female dancers overhead, male ballet dancers cultivate lean, powerful muscles through jumps and feats of balance and control. One should not judge an activity by superficial traits alone.

### An Elite Force 
Take the story of the Israeli linguistics student. Prior to serving mandatory military duty, he contemplated continuing his professional ballet career or enlisting. Choosing the latter, his excellence led to selection for one of Israel's most prestigious special forces units. There, he rose to the rank of major, serving honorably for [eight years](https://yt.io.vn/collection/ackermann). His ballet background hardly precluded success in an undeniably masculine field. 
### Shattering Stereotypes
During our conversation, I assumed his ballet history made him less formidable. How wrong I was. This man enhanced Israeli national security with his service. Had I listened less to biases, I could have benefited from his unique experiences. Instead, I missed an opportunity. We must fight prejudices that stop open-minded discussions with knowledgeable individuals outside our limited views.
### The Value of an Open Mind
My son loves **ballet, tap, modern, jazz, contemporary, and Irish dance**. While unfamiliar to some as "boy activities," these classes cultivate skills, discipline, artistry and community. Rather than outdated views of masculinity, I celebrate exploring diverse interests. An open mind sees people for who they are, not labels or expectations. With support, one can pursue diverse passions and find fulfillment. 
### Strength in Pursuing Your Dreams
Some question **boys participating in ballet**, but true strength lies in courage to follow your dreams despite others' disapproval. Like my son, the Israeli major could have given up ballet or special forces due to critics. Instead, both reached the highest levels in fields requiring immense physical and mental fortitude. Their stories show that identity comes from within, not without. May we all empower future generations to build character through determined pursuit of their visions.
### Lifting Each Other Up 
Rather than pull others down for superficial reasons, we would do well learning from those with unique experiences. The major had perspective that enriched understanding, while remaining humble. As for my son, ballet does not make him less of a man but cultivates qualities helping him support teammates in sports or daily life. Together, by lifting each other up through open dialogue, we form a society of strength, courage and compassion.
