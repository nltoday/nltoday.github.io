### Download and Install Visual C++ Redistributables
One common error encountered when playing Call of Duty Black Ops 2 is related to missing Visual C++ libraries. Make sure to download and install the correct Visual **C++ Redistributables** package for your system, which are usually located in the game's install folder under 'redist'. For example, the x86 version of Visual C++ Redistributables may be found at "C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops II\redist\vcredist_x86.exe". Running this file will install the necessary Visual C++ components.

### Update DirectX Libraries
In addition to Visual C++, the DirectX libraries may also need to be updated. Navigate to the 'redist\DirectX' folder within the game install location to find 'dxsetup.exe'. Running this file will check for and install any required DirectX updates. For Black Ops 2, the DirectX setup file may be located at "C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops II\redist\DirectX\DXSETUP.exe".
### Verify Game Cache Integrity
Through Steam, right click on Black Ops 2 in your library, select 'Properties', and go to the 'Local Files' tab. Click on 'Verify integrity of game cache' to have Steam check the game files and replace any missing or corrupted components. Allow this process to fully complete before attempting to launch the game again.
### Compatibility Mode and Administrator Privileges
If the game is still encountering errors, try running it in Windows [Compatibility Mode](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cow-mom-cute-womens-70s-80s-retro-style-sunset-moo-moo-lover-v-neck-t-shirt/men&) after right clicking the executable and navigating to Properties. You may also need to run the game with **Administrator privileges** by right clicking and selecting 'Run as administrator'.
### Instructions for Pirated Versions
For those playing a pirated/uncracked version of Black Ops 2, ensure you have the latest crack/patch downloaded from a trusted source such as **Skidrow**. Install and run the crack as instructed - it will replace faulty game files to resolve common errors seen in pirated copies. Once updated, the game should launch smoothly. 
### Troubleshoot Graphics Driver Issues
Outdated or corrupted graphics drivers can interfere with games like Black Ops 2. Make sure to check for and install any available updates for your video card directly from the manufacturer's website. Some users also report success by completely uninstalling graphics drivers with software like DDU and reinstalling the latest clean version.
### Reinstall Game as Last Resort
If all other troubleshooting steps have failed, consider fully reinstalling Black Ops 2 as a last resort. Make sure to delete all game files and folders beforehand without exceptions. A fresh install may resolve hard-to-track issues caused by incomplete removal of previous installations or corrupted game data.
With patience and by following the outlined solutions methodically, you should ultimately be able to resolve any errors and enjoy playing Call of Duty Black Ops 2 seamlessly whether through Steam or otherwise. Let me know if any issues persist after attempting these common fixes.
