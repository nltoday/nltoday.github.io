Spanish is a beautiful and expressive language with many nuances. However, one phrase that has multiple meanings depending on context is "it is". Let's explore the different ways to say "it is" and understand when to use each one.
## Essential Spanish Verbs 
There are a few core Spanish verbs that are used to translate "it is" based on the context of the entire sentence. The most common are [ser](https://yt.io.vn/collection/ackermann) and **estar**. 
### Ser vs Estar
**Ser** is used to describe intrinsic qualities or characteristics that do not change. For example, "Soy alta" means "I am tall" because one's height does not typically change. **Estar** is used to describe temporary qualities or conditions. "Estoy cansada" means "I am tired" since being tired is usually not a permanent state. 
Understanding the subtle difference between **ser** and **estar** is essential for correctly translating sentences with "it is". Refer to this table for a quick reference on when to use each verb:
| Verb | Usage |
|-|-|
|**Ser**| Intrinsic qualities, unchanging characteristics, locations|
|**Estar**| Temporary states or conditions, location at a specific time|
