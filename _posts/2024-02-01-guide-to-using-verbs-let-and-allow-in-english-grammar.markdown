### Understanding the Difference Between Let and Allow
Let and allow are two verbs that are commonly used when describing permission in English. However, there is a subtle grammatical difference between the two that is important to understand. When using the verb "let", we follow it directly with the base form of the verb without including "to". For example, "The police let the thief go". 
With the verb "allow", we use "to" followed by the base form of the verb. For example, "The police allowed the thief to go". This shows that "let" is followed directly by the infinitive form of the verb without "to", while "allow" is followed by "to + infinitive".

### Examples of Using Let Without "To" 
As mentioned, when using "let" we do not include the word "to" before the following verb. Here are some examples:
**She let them watch TV.** In this sentence, "let" is followed directly by "watch" without adding "to". **He didn't let us go home until midnight.** Again, "let" is followed by "go" without a preceding "to". **I will let you copy my homework.** The verb following "let" in this case is "copy" with no "to" included.
These examples demonstrate how "let" takes the bare infinitive form of the following verb without needing "to". This is different from "allow" which always requires "to" before the next verb.
### When to Use Allow with "To"
When using the verb "allow", we must always include "to" before the following verb. Some examples:
**The police allowed the thief to go.** Here, "allowed" is followed by "to" and then the verb "go". **They will allow us to watch a movie.** In this sentence, "allow" is once again paired with "to" prior to the next verb, "watch". **Parents rarely allow children to stay up late.** "Allow" connects to "to" and then "stay" in this case. 
As you can see, "allow" demands the inclusion of "to" to link it to the subsequent verb. Failing to use "to" after "allow" would be ungrammatical.
### Remembering the Key Differences
To summarize the main differences between "let" and "allow":
- "Let" is followed directly by the bare infinitive form of the next verb without needing "to". 
- "Allow" must always be paired with "to" connecting it to the following verb. 
- Examples are: "She let them watch TV" vs. "They allowed them to watch TV".
Making sure to apply these subtle rules will ensure your use of "let" and "allow" is grammatically correct in sentences. Remembering which verb requires "to" is an important part of mastering English grammar.
### Common Mistakes to Avoid 
While the distinctions between "let" and "allow" may seem small, it's easy to mix them up if you're not careful. Here are some typical mistakes non-native speakers often make:
**Saying "let to"** - Remember never to include "to" after "let". "I let to watch TV" is incorrect.
**Omitting "to" after "allow"** - When using "allow", don't forget that crucial "to". "They allowed watch TV" is wrong.  
[Confusing the verbs](https://store.fi.io.vn/cute-axolotl-funny-i-axolotl-questions-salamander-265/women&) - Make sure you understand which verbs pair with and without "to". Don't say "They let us to go" for example.
Being aware of these common errors can help you solidify the proper usage of "let" versus "allow". With practice, the subtle difference will become second nature.
### When Learning Gets Easier
Mastering new grammar rules takes time and repetition. But with focused study and examples put to use in real sentences, the distinction between "let" and "allow" will gradually sink in. Some tips to help cement your understanding:
- Read examples aloud, focusing on the flow between the verbs. Hearing it aids memory.
- Write your own sentences using "let" and "allow" correctly on a consistent basis.
- Get feedback from native English speakers if you're unsure of specific cases. 
- Review tricky areas periodically for reinforcement. Don't stop practicing until it's automatic.
With dedicated practice spaced over time, complex ideas become simple through familiarity. Consistently apply what you've learned and grammar mastery will follow. Remember - steady effort is key to long-term success in any language skill.
