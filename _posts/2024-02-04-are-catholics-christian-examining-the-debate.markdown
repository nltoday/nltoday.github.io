Catholicism is one of the oldest and most widespread forms of Christianity in the world. However, there remains disagreement over whether Catholics should truly be considered Christian. This article aims to thoughtfully examine different perspectives in the debate.
### Defining Christianity 
There is no singular, undisputed authority that defines what constitutes a "true" Christian. Christianity originally developed as multiple sects and denominations with differing beliefs and practices. [Some key defining factors](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/acheson) that most scholars agree upon are believing in one God as a Trinity, following the teachings of Jesus Christ, and acceptance of core doctrines established in early Christian creeds like the Apostles' or Nicene Creeds. Catholics meet these broadly accepted conditions for Christianity. They believe in the resurrection of Christ, salvation through faith, and other foundational tenets.

### Catholicism's Origins and Continuity 
An argument made in favor of Catholic Christianity is the church's direct origins and historical continuity dating back to the establishment of the early Christian community by Jesus and his apostles. The Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church are the only institutions that can trace their lineage and succession of bishops back to this first century period. While other denominations developed later, Catholicism maintained a stable hierarchy and body of doctrine handed down from the initial founding generation of Christians. This gives it a credible claim as the original and oldest form of the faith. 
### Disputes over Distinctive Catholic Beliefs
Some Protestants object to certain Catholic doctrines and practices not explicitly mentioned in the Bible, such as papal authority, Marian veneration, the rosary, or transubstantiation in communion. However, other Christian communities also hold distinctive beliefs not found verbatim in scripture, such as Baptist baptism requirements or Pentecostal gifts of the Spirit. Disagreements exist even among Protestants. A lack of universal agreement on non-essential theological matters does not alone remove Catholicism from Christianity.
### Acknowledging Diversity Within Unity
Rather than attacking other groups, the most constructive approach acknowledges diversity within the overarching unity of faith in Christ. The Bible never prescribes a single uniform system of doctrines and encourages liberty of conscience. Early Christianity welcomed a variety of perspectives. Modern ecumenical efforts seek to restore communion by focusing on our shared confession of the risen Lord. Ultimately, determining who is or isn't a "true" Christian is best left to God, in whose hands final judgment rests.
### The Protestant Bible's Origins
Critics who reject Catholic scriptural canon forget that the New Testament collection was not finalized until the 4th century, under Catholic leadership. Martin Luther removed 7 books from the Old Testament canon, shortening it to the Hebrew Bible used by Jews at his time. But Jesus and early Christians recognized additional texts, so the Catholic version more fully preserves the Bible known to the original community. Furthermore, all Protestant confessions are built upon the foundational confession of faith established at Nicea by early Catholic bishops.
### A Nuanced and Thoughtful Perspective is Needed  
Overall, there are good-faith arguments on both sides of this complex debate. As with many religious issues, an overly simplistic or narrow definition tends to breed division rather than understanding. A more nuanced, inclusive and thoughtful approach is needed. Catholics and Protestants share far more in common than what separates them, centered around core salvific Christian truths. While theological persuasions may differ, faithfulness to Jesus Christ in both belief and action is what truly matters most.
