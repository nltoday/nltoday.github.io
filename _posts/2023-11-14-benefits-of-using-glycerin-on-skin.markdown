Glycerin is a humectant frequently used in skincare products for its hydrating properties. Keep reading to learn about the many skin benefits of glycerin and how to incorporate it into your skincare routine.
## Glycerin Draws Moisture to the Skin 
Glycerin has the ability to attract moisture from the air and bind it to the skin.

Glycerin works as a humectant to increase the skin's moisture content and lock it in.
### Glycerin Creates a Dewy, Youthful Appearance
The moisture-binding properties of glycerin leave the complexion with a plump, dewy look. A hydrated, supple skin texture appears smoother and more elastic. Fine lines and wrinkles may also appear reduced when the skin is properly hydrated. The radiant, glowing effect of glycerin use can make skin appear more youthful and healthy.
