Batman Begins takes clear inspiration from Batman: Year One in depicting Bruce Wayne's origins and initial activities as Batman. The climactic confrontation with Carmine Falcone in the film replicates scenes from the comic where Batman fights organized crime bosses. Nolan aimed to ground the character in a realistic, yet still faithful, adaptation of this seminal Batman tale.
