## Introduction
In this article, we will do an in-depth comparison between AMD Ryzen and Intel processors across different price points and usage scenarios. We'll look at their specifications, performance benchmarks and value for money.
## Ryzen vs Intel Entry-Level CPUs  
At the entry level, the AMD Ryzen 3 2200G competes against the Intel Core i3-8100. According to benchmarks, the Ryzen 3 2200G provides **1% lower CPU performance** for $20 less while including a bundled cooler. The Ryzen also has the advantage of integrated **Vega 8 graphics**, making it a good affordable option for budget builders.
Moving to the mid-range, the Ryzen 5 2600 offers significantly better value than the Intel Core i5-8400. Benchmarks show the Ryzen delivers **over 10% higher performance** for $30 less. The extra cores and threads give it an edge for **multithreaded workloads**.
## Ryzen Dominates the Mid-Range   
Stepping up to higher core counts, the AMD Ryzen 7 2700X matched up against the Intel Core i7-8700K. Here, the i7 has a **small 7% lead in performance** but costs $60 more. However, the Ryzen still competes very closely while bundling the RGB Wraith Prism cooler. Its extra cores make it better suited for **multitasking and content creation**. 
Another notable comparison is between the Ryzen Threadripper 1920X and the Intel Core i9-9900K. Here, Intel's flagship mainstream CPU pulls ahead by **20% in performance**. But for only $75 more, the value proposition shifts towards AMD which provides 12 cores versus Intel's 8 cores.
## High-End Showdown - Threadripper vs Core i9
At the absolute high-end, the AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2990WX goes head to head with the Intel Core i9-9980XE. In this matchup, benchmark data shows the Threadripper achieving **5% higher performance** while costing a significant $350 less. This makes it the undisputed brand of choice for hardcore **workstation tasks** that can take advantage of its massive 32 core/64 thread muscle.
## Gaming Performance - A Small Intel Advantage  
When it comes to gaming, Intel CPUs do have a slight edge of around **5-15% higher framerates** on average compared to similarly priced Ryzen parts. However, for most users the difference will be imperceptible. The Ryzen CPUs still deliver a great experience, especially when factors like price and platform upgrade options are considered.
## Conclusion
In summary, AMD Ryzen processors offer far better value than their Intel Core counterparts across most price categories and usage types. They either match or exceed Intel's performance while undercutting on price. The only area where Intel retains an advantage is straight gaming, but even there the gap is marginal for most users. Overall, AMD Ryzen is undoubtedly the better choice for both productivity workflows and mainstream gaming builds.
