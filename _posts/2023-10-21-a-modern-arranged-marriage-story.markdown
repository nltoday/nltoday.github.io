### A Game of Thrones Inspiration
Jon Snow has been binge watching Game of Thrones and getting some strange ideas. He starts dreaming of living in a medieval society with arranged marriages and intrigues. Despite being far removed from those times, one idea sticks out to him - why not have an arranged marriage to strengthen family bonds?
He brings up the idea to his cousin Robb. At first Robb thinks Jon has truly been watching too much TV. However, Jon convinces him of the benefits. **Modern family ties, political alliances**. They decide to have an arranged marriage to keep wealth and property within their close family circle. 
After discussing options, they agree Sansa would be a great match for Jon. She's **beautiful, intelligent and from a strong noble house** - the Starks. Jon goes to propose the idea to Sansa. To his surprise, she isn't totally against it!

### An Unexpected Proposal  
Sansa has always been a bit of a dreamer too. While she never considered an arranged marriage, the idea of being united with Jon intrigues her. They've known each other since childhood and always got along. She sees how it could strengthen their family bonds for generations. 
At first her parents Catelyn and Ned are skeptical of this old tradition. But their children convince them of the benefits. **Keeping inheritance within the family, preserving legacy.** Ned also believes in the importance of duty and family above all else. He gives his blessing to the union.
News spreads quickly among their extended clan. Most welcome the idea of keeping wealth and status within their close circle. However, Arya and Bran think it's too old fashioned. They believe in finding **true love rather than political marriages.** Still, they support their brother and sister in whatever choice they make.
### Preparing for the Ceremony
With families in agreement, preparations begin for the wedding. It will be a grand community event to celebrate the union. 
Robb and Theon volunteer to plan the [feast and celebrations](https://yt.io.vn/collection/agudelo). They want it to be the social event of the season. Meera Reed offers to help Sansa with dress fittings and last minute preparations. She's excited to see her dear friend in such a splendid gown.
Meanwhile, Jon has been training with Brienne of Tarth. She's helping him sharpen his skills so he can defend his house and family name. On the day, he wants to look every inch the strong noble lord that Sansa deserves.
Soon the big day arrives. This new tradition seems to be bringing the community together in joyful harmony. Maybe old ways can mix with new values after all.
