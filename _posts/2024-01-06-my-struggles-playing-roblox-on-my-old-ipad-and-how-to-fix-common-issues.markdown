Over the past few months, I have been facing some problems while playing Roblox on my old iPad. I am not sure if it is only happening to me or if others are also experiencing similar issues. Let me share my experience and the steps I have taken to try resolving it. 
### Crashing and Kicking Off to the Home Screen
My iPad is over 4 years old now and anytime I try playing games like [Welcome To Blox burg](https://store.fi.io.vn/funny-chihuahuas-easter-day-bunny-eggs-easter-costume-womens-chihuahua-dog) or **Adopt Me!** that require higher graphics, it would kick me off to the home screen within a few minutes of playing. This was very frustrating as I spent **Robux** to play these games but couldn't enjoy them fully.
The crashing was also random at times even on less graphic intensive games like **Crown Academy**. I wasn't sure if it was just my device acting up or a wider issue. Seeing it happen consistently across different games pointed towards an issue with my aging iPad.

### Checking for Updates and Clearing Cache  
The first thing I did was make sure my iPad and Roblox app were both fully updated to the latest versions. Sometimes older versions can be buggy. I then force closed and cleared the cache of the Roblox app hoping it would solve memory/cache issues.   
However, the crashing persisted. So I started researching common issues people face playing Roblox on older devices and what tips others recommended. Many suggested it could be due to low storage space or battery issues too.
### Freeing Up Storage and Checking Battery Health
I checked the storage on my iPad and found it was almost full leaving little free space. Roblox games need storage space to run smoothly. I deleted some unused apps and files to free up over 2GB of storage.
Looking at the battery health in settings, I saw it had deteriorated to only 80% of the original capacity after years of use. Low battery could be causing it to shut down apps abruptly. 
Despite these steps, the crashing continued but less frequently now. It seemed my iPad was simply too old and underpowered now to handle graphically intensive Roblox games. Upgrading to a newer model seemed the best long term solution.
### Reinstalling the App as a Last Resort
As a last troubleshooting step before upgrading, I completely uninstalled then reinstalled the Roblox app from the App Store. Sometimes reinstalling can fix corrupted files or cache issues not resolved by clearing the cache alone.
Surprisingly, this seemed to have solved the crashing issue entirely! I have been able to enjoy **Welcome To Blox burg** and other games without any disconnections for over a week now. Reinstalling the app as a last resort really did the trick in my case.
Of course a new iPad would allow me to play all games smoothly. But this inexpensive solution stopped the bother of crashing until I can upgrade. I hope sharing my experience helps others facing similar Roblox crashing problems on their older devices! Let me know if you have any other questions.
