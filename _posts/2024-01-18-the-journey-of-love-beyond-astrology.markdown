### A Chance Encounter
Mr. M was an ambitious advocate searching for a suitable life partner. Through an old friend, he heard about the beautiful and elegant Ms. S, also an advocate based in Coorg. Intrigued, he traveled there immediately to see her for himself. Upon their chance meeting at the civil court, he knew with certainty that she was the one he wanted to spend his life with. However, convincing her conservative father Mr. D, an ex-military man, would not be easy.

### A Tactful Request
Before returning to Mangalore, Mr. M decided to meet Mr. D at his xerox shop. As luck would have it, the power went off just as Mr. M entered with his driving license, requesting a photocopy. Respecting Mr. D's gruff response, he left discreetly yet remained determined. Back in Mangalore, with his [persuasive writing skills](https://store.fi.io.vn/work-hard-so-my-st-bernard-live-a-better-dog-lover-2), he penned a tactful letter to request Ms. S's hand in marriage, keeping Mr. D's military background in mind.
### An Auspicious Match
Mr. D was impressed by Mr. M's letter. However, as was customary, he insisted on **matching their horoscopes** for an auspicious union. The details were exchanged, but Mr. M knew astrology held no significance to his love. So he cleverly fabricated a matching horoscope with the help of an astrologer. Both astrologers Mr. D consulted, one due to **greed and other sincerity**, concurred it was an ideal match. The engagement was fixed within a month.
### A Blessed Union 
Over the next six months, Mr. M and Ms. S's affection grew steadily. They married amidst family and friends, beginning their journey as a loving couple. In time, they were blessed with two beautiful daughters too. Against all odds and norms, their **unconditional love** and commitment to each other ensured a happy marriage of over two decades. 
### Life Lessons 
Looking back, Mr. M realizes that true love transcends superficial customs and beliefs. While astrology served practical purposes historically for arranged unions, compatibility depends on one's character, not cosmic configurations. As for his daughters, he hopes they follow their heart in matters of the heart. Society may influence choices, but life teaches one to trust inner peace above all else.
### Changing Times  
Gradually, as people migrated to cities, knowing potential partners before marriage became more common. This reduced total reliance on astrology for vetting suitability. Even then, a basic matching of horoscopes offered reassurance to conservative families. But compatibility cannot be determined by planetary positions alone. Non-quantifiable qualities like affection, respect, sharing common values and priorities matter far more for lasting bonds.
### Love Conquers All
Against all odds and norms, Mr. M and Ms. S proved that love can overcome any obstacle if rooted in sincerity. While they faced objections, believing in each other gave them courage. Their humble yet blissful family life stands testimony to how inner warmth nurtures relationships. Like their example shows, true devotion lies in understanding each other beyond surface differences and staying united through challenges of life. Love is the sole force that makes any union meaningful.
### Walking the Inner Path 
As someone who once adhered blindly to horoscope dictates, Mr. M now emphasizes observing one's heart above all. Forcing incompatible pairs leads to dissatisfaction while disregarding affinity risks missing deep companionship. Each individual must diligently assess suitors based on affinity of personalities, character, attitudes and aspirations - not parameters established by society. Walking the high road of conscience alone can direct one to their perfect partner and unhindered happiness.
