### Life as a Skinny Person
Being underweight has always been a part of who I am. Growing up, my family and friends would comment on how slim I was. While some saw it as an advantage, being able to eat whatever I wanted without gaining weight, the reality is that it came with its own set of challenges. 
People would often assume I had an eating disorder or was dieting. The truth is, I've always had a [high metabolism](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/aliff) and ate normally like everyone else. No matter how much I ate, the numbers on the scale never seemed to change much. Friends and family meant well, but their constant reminders to "eat more" became irritating over time. 
Shopping for clothes was also difficult. The smallest sizes were often still too big. Belts and watches would slide around loosely on my wrists. Sitting on hard surfaces was uncomfortable without extra padding. Travelling by public transport meant squeezing into tight spaces or sitting on someone's lap. My physical strength and endurance wasn't as great as my peers either.  
Beyond the physical, comments from others about my body also took a mental toll. Being called "too skinny" or told I needed to "eat a cheeseburger" made me self-conscious. The constant focus on my weight made it difficult not to internalize negative thoughts about my appearance. While I liked certain aspects of being slim, overall it brought more struggles than benefits.

### A Concerning Diagnosis  
Last year during my annual checkup, my doctor noticed something alarming. Compared to previous years, I had lost **10 pounds** (4.5 kg) without explanation. Looking at the growth chart showing my height and weight progression over the years, the downward sloping line was cause for concern. 
My doctor expressed worry about my weight loss and lack of gains. She proceeded to list all the changes I needed to make - eating more frequent and structured meals and snacks, limiting junk food, focusing on protein, increasing physical activity. It was overwhelming to hear all the requirements just to maintain a normal, healthy weight. 
I was already finding it difficult putting on pounds. Now I had even more pressure with the risk of developing an eating disorder or other health issues if I couldn't meet the weight goals. The diagnosis of being underweight brought fear of failure, unhealthy habits and potential long-term implications for my wellbeing. It was a scary new reality I hadn't prepared for.
### Challenges of Gaining Weight
In the months following, I tried my best to follow the doctor's advice on gaining weight. Eating became a chore - I had to force down calorie-dense meals and snacks even when full. Tracking everything I consumed with an app added more stress. Meeting daily calorie and macro-nutrient targets felt like a job.
No matter how hard I tried, the scale rarely showed significant progress. On some days, I wondered if all the effort was worth it for just a pound or two gained. Losing motivation was easy when changes weren't visible. The constancy demand on my body took both a physical and mental toll. 
Sitting through family meals while being constantly watched as I ate was uncomfortable. Comments and unsolicited advice didn't help either - "Why are you eating so slow? Just finish it!" Receiving attention for my weight, whether positive or negative, fueled my self-doubt. I started dreading meals and conversations about food. 
### # Managing a "Skinny" Mindset
Along the challenges, slowly letting go of the "skinny" identity I associated with for so long wasn't easy either. From a young age, I derived a sense of self from comments on my slim physique. Learning to value myself beyond just a number on the scale required mental recalibration. 
It was hard accepting a body that didn't fit my idea of "skinny" or look the same in clothes. Negative self-talk had to be rewired with compassion. Old habits of restricting intake needed replacing with trust in my body's natural process. Managing relationships where weight was a constant discussion topic tested emotional resilience.
My struggles highlighted how deeply engrained biases are towards certain body types. Being thin was an identity, but also brought judgment, assumptions and invalidation of personal struggles. My health was prioritized, but mental well-being occasionally got overlooked. It was a challenging journey of self-discovery, understanding and acceptance.
### Small Victories and Ongoing Efforts
Over the past year, focused effort has brought modest yet meaningful gains. Making progress, no matter how little, provided motivation. Slowly, rigid rules around eating transitioned to listening to hunger and fullness cues. Meal times became less anxiously anticipated and more mindfully enjoyed. 
Support systems like kind family members, caring friends and an understanding doctor helped immensely. Celebrating non-scale victories like increased strength or stamina lifted spirits during difficult days. Positive self-talk dismantled old limiting beliefs piece by piece. 
While the journey is ongoing, I've learned to be kinder to myself through it. Weight gain needn't define self-worth. Maintaining health through balance and sustainability became priorities over strict targets. Life has subtler pleasures beyond just numbers. 
Going forward, my hope is continued progress in a compassionate manner. Though cultural biases may take longer to fully overcome, prioritizing wellbeing - physical, mental and emotional - is the true goal. Each day brings a chance to appreciate what a strong, resilient body and spirit this has helped cultivate.
