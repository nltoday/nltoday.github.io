China's foreign relations throughout history were shaped by its worldview and political system at the time. The modern concepts of sovereignty and territorial integrity did not exist, leading to different interpretations of foreign involvement. This article analyzes ancient China's perspective on foreign affairs through its value system and the statuses of neighboring polities.
### Confident in Their Superior Civilization 
Ancient Chinese culture propagated the saying **"Under heaven, there are no lands that are not the lands of the ruler; under heaven, there are no people who are not the people of the ruler"**. They believed China represented civilization while others were **"barbarians"**. However, their perception of **"barbarians"** was not based on race but cultural identity. The Chinese thought all people could become civilized through education in Chinese values and culture. This confident worldview drove China's cultural expansion.

### A Unified Empire Under the emperor
Another core concept was that **"Heaven has no two suns, the people have no two lords"**. Only one emperor could legitimately rule the **"universal empire" (tianxia)**. Neighboring polities had to choose between fighting for supremacy or becoming a **vassal state (feng)** swearing allegiance to the emperor. As vassals, they recognized Chinese suzerainty in name while governing autonomously with imperial support. This quasi-independent status avoided designation as a foreign country.
### Mutual Benefits of Tributary Relations
Most polities opted to become tributary states due to tangible benefits. They received economic opportunities through trade permission, military protection, and annual gifts of treasure from China. In return, they nominally accepted Chinese dominance. For China, tributary relations validated their worldview without territorial expansion. Both sides benefited from cooperation within this Sinocentric international order.
### Flexible Perceptions of Conquered Lands
China occasionally invaded tributaries but saw these as domestic issues rather than foreign aggression. After conquests, they viewed annexed regions as reclaimed Chinese culture. For example, Vietnam shares a thousand-year history of Chinese rule yet considers its pre-annexation polities distinctly Vietnamese. China incorporated ethnic groups like the Manchu conquers over time through intermarriage and assimilation into Han identity. Such flexible identities blurred the line between foreign and domestic affairs.
### Accepting New International Norms
This Sinocentric worldview remained predominant until challenges from Western imperialism in the 19th century. China's defeat in the Opium Wars forced acknowledgment of other countries' sovereignty and a place in the international system of sovereign states. While past actions could be seen as Chinese expansionism, the overriding perspective was maintaining order through harmonious integration of neighboring cultures into their ecumene.
### Regional Hegemony Through Soft and Hard Power
Even after accepting new foreign policy norms, **China seeks regional predominance through economic interdependence and political clout rather than direct rule.** Beijing aims to make Southeast Asia dependent on Chinese capital while isolating the influence of competitors like the US and Japan. It uses infrastructure and trade to cultivate pro-China governments willing to accept Chinese strategic priorities. Military force remains an option of last resort to absorb territories like Tibet and Xinjiang administered as integral parts of China due to historical suzerainty claims.
### Legacy of a Flexible yet Expansionary Worldview
In conclusion, ancient China's international relations were shaped by a confidently Sinocentric worldview seeing others as tributary states within a universal Chinese ecumene. This justified cultural expansion and dominance through both soft power co-optation and military subjugation when challenged. While no longer following this framework, China's self-image as a great civilization makes it still prone to viewing itself as the natural hegemon in East Asia based on historical precedent. However, its acceptance of the modern nation-state system means it prefers nonmilitary expansion of influence. The legacy of this flexible yet expansionary worldview continues to influence China's self-perception and foreign policy priorities in Asia today.
