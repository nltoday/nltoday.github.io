### The Bedrock Edition is More Profitable
Microsoft receives 30% of the proceeds from all content bought from the Minecraft Marketplace on Bedrock Edition. The Marketplace does not exist on Java Edition which represents lost revenue. Additionally, Microsoft has shifted focus to the Bedrock Edition, so prioritizing Java Edition porting makes little business sense.

### File Modification is Difficult on Consoles  
A key appeal of Java Edition is modding through modification of game files. However, modifying game files on consoles like PS4 is challenging for average players due to security and permission restrictions. Porting Java Edition to PS4 would diminish this important advantage it holds over Bedrock Edition on other platforms.
### The Bedrock Edition Already Exists on PS4
Bedrock Edition was designed from the ground up for cross-platform compatibility across smartphones, consoles and PC. It is well optimized to run smoothly on PS4 and other devices. Dedicating resources to port an older version like Java Edition that does not support cross-play would undermine the ecosystem Microsoft has built around Bedrock Edition.
### Java Edition Map Conversion Works Only One Way  
While maps can be transferred from legacy console editions like PS3 to newer ones on PS4, this conversion is a one-time process and maps cannot be transferred back. Once a world is upgraded to the larger PS4 world size and format, it is permanently inaccessible on the original PS3 version. A Java Edition port on PS4 would require establishing a similar one-way map transfer process.   
### Performance Differences Between Editions
The Java Edition codebase differs substantially from Bedrock Edition and was not designed and optimized from the ground up for console hardware like PS4. Porting it would require extensive optimization work that may still not yield the smooth performance of Bedrock Edition given the Java Edition's legacy code. This performance disparity further diminishes the case for a Java Edition port.
### Maintaining Two Editions is Redundant
With Bedrock Edition already available on PS4 and most platforms, maintaining two separate editions of Minecraft that do not support cross-play would confuse players and dilute development resources. Given that Bedrock supports cross-play and the Marketplace while addressing technical issues like modding and performance that plague Java Edition on consoles, there seems little value in porting the older edition separately.
In conclusion, while the Java Edition userbase remains strong on PC, the technical, performance and business factors discussed make a port to PS4 an unlikely proposition that does not align well with Microsoft's Bedrock Edition-centered Minecraft strategy going forward. Players looking for the Minecraft experience on PlayStation are best served by the existing Bedrock Edition version.
