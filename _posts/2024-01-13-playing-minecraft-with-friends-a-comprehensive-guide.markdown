### Getting Started
Playing Minecraft with friends can be incredibly fun and memorable. However, for Java Edition, there isn’t an in-game friends list and you must utilize other methods to connect with friends. To play together, you will need to either join the same server or connect locally over a LAN network. Some popular choices for playing on servers with friends include **Hypixel, Mineplex,[ and other ](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-unicorn3847-t-shirt)multiplayer minigame servers.**

### Choosing a Server
When selecting a **Minecraft multiplayer server** to play on with friends, there are a few factors to consider. First, decide if you want to play **Vanilla Minecraft** without any modifications or choose a **modded server** with custom maps, plugins, and mod packs installed. Modded servers open up many more creative possibilities but require keeping mod packs updated. You'll also want to find a server with a **friendly community** where you and your friends can enjoy the game without dealing with griefers or other disruptive players. Many servers implement **whitelisting** which helps maintain a pleasant gameplay environment. Be sure to read server rules and consider average player counts too.
### Adding Friends on Servers 
Once you've agreed on a server to play on, you'll need to add each other as friends. Server platforms like **Hypixel** allow easy in-game friending through commands. For example, on Hypixel type "/f [username]" to send a friend request. On other servers, use the "/help" command to find out their specific friending process. Having each other added makes finding and communicating with friends seamless regardless of what world or game you're playing together on the server.
### Playing Together Locally
If you prefer playing in a more private setting without other players, you can connect locally over a LAN network. Both players need to be on the same home network or connected to the same WiFi hotspot. Then, open to LAN options in-game and share the resulting IP address to invite friends. However, playing over LAN requires being physically together which isn’t always possible. So servers provide a more flexible remote option.
### Choosing Game Modes 
With friends, explore the many unique game modes servers offer. Popular options include classic **Survival mode** working together to mine resources and build massive structures. Try your skills in **PvP modes** like **Sky Wars, Bed Wars** and **Murder Mystery** where you’ll need strong teamwork. For something more relaxed, venture into beautiful **creative worlds** and let your imaginations run wild constructing anything you can think of. Many servers also host rotating mini-games ensuring you never run out of fresh challenges. 
### Communicating with Friends
Consistent communication is key for successful cooperation with friends while playing. In addition to server chat channels, utilize third-party voice calls and messaging apps. Popular choices include **Discord,** which has integrated well with Minecraft in recent years. You can start or join existing server voice channels right from the Minecraft main menu. Apps like **Skype, TeamSpeak** and **Mumble** also work great for clear voice coordination during intense situations. Coordinate strategies, warn each other of dangers and just enjoy chatting together to strengthen your gaming bonds.
### Having Fun and Making Memories
Ultimately, playing Minecraft with friends is all about making the experience enjoyable and memorable for everyone involved. Approach each session with a spirit of fun, collaboration and goodsportsmanship. Compliment each other on successes, provide encouragement after failures and most of all, keep a positive atmosphere. With the right group of caring friends, even the simplest of adventures in this blocky world can create lifelong gaming memories to look back on. So hop on a server today and start your journey!
