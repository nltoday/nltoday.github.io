### Determining Factors
There are several factors that determine the average weight of a baby by 3 months. Some of the key ones are whether the baby is breastfed or formula fed, their sex, and birth weight. **Breastfed babies tend to be lighter than formula-fed infants**. On average, **formula-fed babies weigh more** because formula has a higher calorie content than breastmilk. Additionally, [boys generally weigh slightly more than girls](https://store.fi.io.vn/mommysaurus-mom-mom-2-kids1697-t-shirt) at the same age due to natural biological differences. A baby's birth weight also provides an important baseline, with heavier babies at birth typically gaining more weight in the first few months.

### Impact of Feeding Method
The way a baby is fed in their first months can greatly impact their average weight by 3 months. Exclusively **breastfed babies** typically weigh less than formula-fed babies because breastmilk is easier to digest and has a lower calorie density. At 3 months, most **breastfeeding infants** weigh between 11 to 14 pounds. In comparison, formula-fed infants may average closer to 14 pounds by this age due to the higher calorie content of formula milk. switching between breastfeeding and formula feeding can also affect weight gain patterns.
### Gender Differences in Weight 
Subtle differences often emerge based on a baby's sex in their early months. On average, **male infant weights** tend to be slightly higher than female weights by 3 months. This tracks with established biological norms where male bodies generally carry more muscle and fat mass naturally. A **breastfed baby boy** may reach close to 14 pounds by his 3 month checkup, while a **breastfed girl** of the same size at birth may be around 12-13 pounds. These variances are considered normal as long as weight gains remain steady month-to-month.
### Tracking Weight Percentiles
To properly understand a baby's weight progression, pediatricians utilize growth charts that track weight, length, and head circumference as percentiles. A baby's measurements at birth establish their starting percentile, usually between the 1st to 99th percentiles. Clinicians then monitor if the baby remains along their curve or deviates significantly higher or lower over time. ** Drastic drops or jumps in percentiles** between well-baby visits could signify an underlying issue needing attention. Staying close to their birth percentile shows steady healthy growth.
### Example Weight Gains 
As an example, a baby boy who weighed 7 pounds at birth and was **exclusively breastfed** may reach 13-14 pounds by his 3 month appointment. Meanwhile, a baby girl born at 6 pounds who received some formula in addition to breastfeeding may achieve 12 pounds. Both of these weight gain trajectories would be deemed developmentally appropriate. Every baby's needs are unique, so consulting with your pediatrician ensures they remain thriving based on individual growth patterns.
### Focusing on Wellbeing Over Numbers
Rather than obsessing over the scale, parents should rely more on visible indicators that their baby is thriving nutritionally. Regular weight checks provide context but take a backseat to signs of adequate food intake like frequent wet and dirty diapers, plump appearance, and content moods between feedings. As long as babies are fed according to their hunger ques and meeting developmental milestones, a slightly higher or lower weight is perfectly normal and healthy. Each child will have their own trajectory determined by inherent traits rather than comparisons.
