When you uninstall and reinstall Steam games, you may wonder if you will keep your save files and progress. There are a few factors that determine whether your saved games will carry over through the reinstallation process.
### Cloud Saves on Steam  
Most modern games on Steam support cloud saves through Steam Cloud functionality. With cloud saves enabled, your saved games and progress are automatically backed up to Steam's servers. When you reinstall a game, Steam will sync your cloud saves and let you pick up where you left off. **Cloud save games seamlessly carry over progress between installations.** By default, Steam Cloud is enabled for all compatible games. You can check the status of cloud saves in the game properties on your Steam library.

### Locally Saved Game Files 
Some older games and those that don't support Steam Cloud saves store game saves locally on your PC. When these games are uninstalled, the default behavior is for the uninstaller to only remove game files and leave your user-created files like saves intact. So when reinstalling, your saved progress will still be present to load. However, for a small number of older titles, the entire game directory may be wiped out. 
### Server-Based Game Profiles
For multiplayer online games and those with persistent online aspects, your [game profile and cloud saves are typically tied to your account](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-crazy-rednecker-my-funny-redneck-boyfriend-v-neck-t-shirt/men&) rather than stored locally. As long as you sign into your account during reinstallation, these types of games will recognize you and any progression. No local game files need to be transferred between installations.
### Manual Backups for Legacy Games
A few legacy games from before Steam Cloud may lack cloud saving capabilities. For these, Steam provides backup and restore features to manually handle moves between installations. You can use the "Backup Game Files" button in the Steam client to save progress locally before uninstalling. Then "Restore Game" brings it back when reinstalled. This ensures saved progress is preserved for even the oldest titles.
### Checking Save Status Before Uninstalling
To be safe, **check whether cloud saves or manual backups are possible before uninstalling any Steam game.** Modern titles likely sync seamlessly, but for those releasing long ago itâ€™s worth verifying save handling. A quick search online can also uncover community workarounds if a special case doesn't fit the normal rules. With planning, you can be confident saved progress will transfer intact to any new installations.
### Maintaining Multiple Installs of a Game  
Steam also enables saving game files separately for different installations of the same title. For example, you could have different saved characters or configurations on separate computers using your account. After installing a game on a new device, check the cloud saves are downloading properly before starting a new game. With careful attention, you need not lose progress even across multiple machines.
### In Summary
In the vast majority of cases, uninstalling and reinstalling Steam games will not erase your saved progress. Modern titles smoothly keep saves synchronized through Steam Cloud. Older games typically leave user files like saves behind. Just verify save handling before uninstalling, or manually backup saves as a precaution. With a little planning, your gaming achievements can follow you throughout multiple installations on any device linked to your Steam account.
