### Joining Accenture
I had joined Accenture in November 2014. For the first 5 months, I completed my 2-month GFT training in Chennai. Then I was in bench for 3 months in Chennai. Finally, I got a project in Bangalore which was my preferred city as my maternal uncle stayed there. 
I received hotel accommodation for 14 days in Bangalore. Afterwards, I shifted to my uncle's place. I got 30k for relocation being an Associate at that time. Different levels receive different amounts. Additionally, I received around 12k for the 14 days' expenses. So in total I received 42k, which was a good amount for me to throw a party for my friends. I was very happy to be shifted to Bangalore for several **reasons:**
1. My uncle stayed in Bangalore
2. Many of my friends worked in the IT hub of Bangalore  
3. Bangalore has a [superb climate](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/albee)
4. Bangalore has no language problems
My office was located in Ecospace, Bangalore. Accenture has 11 offices across Bangalore.

### Life at Accenture Bangalore
Coming to life at Accenture, I enjoyed a lot at Accenture and learned many things. Some highlights include:
1. Accenture respects individuals. In the last 3 years, I never felt like a junior. I received the same respect from team leads, managers, and senior managers as I gave. I felt like we were family members. 
2. My project team included people from across India, so no single language dominated. Team members tried learning each other's languages like Odia and Kannada. We enjoyed outings and parties together without considering levels or ranks.
3. Accenture offered many **self-improvement and skill-building trainings**. My assistant manager always encouraged attending trainings.
### Working at Accenture
At Accenture, generally we maintained an average of 9 working hours per day. Office timings were 8:30 AM to 5:30 PM or 10 AM to 7 PM. Free shuttles were available for these two shifts. For other shifts, we could book cabs through the Accenture transport site. Shift allowances differed by project.
Some other highlights of working at Accenture included:
1. Every month cultural programs and parties were organized which I enjoyed with colleagues. 
2. Indoor and outdoor sports and marathons were organized by senior managers, encouraging participation regardless of winning or losing.
3. Accenture trained us to learn Kannada for a better experience in Bangalore.
4. On Women's Day, Accenture invited accomplished women to speak and offered tiffins/gifts to celebrate women and new facilities.
### Memorable Moments
I have many fond memories of Accenture Bangalore. The weather and people from different parts of India made it very enjoyable. However, staying far from office due to traffic jams was challenging. If allocated a good team and project, I would have never left Accenture Bangalore. The initial days at Accenture were really fun, satisfying with food from high-class hotels and meeting amazing people. My journey began with the College to Corporate (C2C) training and Greenfield Training (GFT), making friends for life. Training assessments secured our jobs, so we took them seriously despite generous attempts. Overall training and resources were the best. 
### Life Beyond Accenture  
After spending over 3 wonderful years in Accenture Bangalore, I moved on to new opportunities. However, I still miss certain aspects of life at Accenture - the culture of respect, diversity of colleagues, regular trainings and activities. These experiences helped me grow both professionally and personally. Even today, I remain grateful to Accenture for kickstarting my career and introducing me to the vibrant IT industry of Bangalore. While change is inevitable, the memories and learning from Accenture will stay with me forever.
