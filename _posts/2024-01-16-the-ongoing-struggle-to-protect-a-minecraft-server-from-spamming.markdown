### Resolving the Issue  
The owner explained that a player named "Spammer Juan" has been relentlessly disrupting their Minecraft server. At first glance, this name raised some red flags, as usernames are not allowed to contain spaces. Further investigation revealed that [Meteor client](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-holiday-santa-riding-shetland-sheepdog-christmas-2), a popular hacked client, enables users to alter their display names and easily create new accounts through **cracked login** methods. Given that the server itself runs on **free game hosting** instead of a paid host, it is extremely vulnerable to this type of spamming and hacking.

### Understanding the Methods of Disruption
To better understand the problem, clarification was needed on what exactly constitutes "spamming" the server. It soon became clear that spamming refers to disruptive and harmful actions like flooding chat with nonsense messages to drown out real conversations, or using hacks and **exploits** to crash the server and kick out all players. With a hacked client that supports **proxy connections** and constant account switching, it would be nearly impossible for staff to effectively ban or block the offender. 
### Evaluating Solutions Within the Limited Resources 
Faced with such a persistent threat, the owner inquired about plugins or other measures that could help. A few anti-proxy and VPN blocking tools were recommended, but with a small player base, **whitelisting** new users may be the most straightforward approach. However, the bigger issue is that both the server and spammer are utilizing **cracked software**, going against Mojang's **terms of use**. While banning cracking is understandable, it does leave low-budget servers open to these kinds of **distributed denial-of-service attacks**.  
### Considering Paid Hosting as the Best Long-Term Fix
In the end, the only real solution presented was to invest in a commercial hosting plan, thereby gaining official access to technical protections unavailable on a free platform. Even paying a small hosting fee or having players purchase legitimate accounts could drastically improve security versus relying on **donations or casual play**. No online community is safe from disruptors without implementing basic safeguards. And for a game as popular as Minecraft, the up-front costs are reasonable to maintain a stable, protected environment for others to enjoy for years to come.
### Recapping the Discussion and Advice Given
To wrap up, the owner was reminded that their current set up leaves very little recourse against sophisticated hackers constantly evading IP bans through **proxy servers**. While blocking tools may help to an extent, whitelisting would be the most practical interim fix. But the only surefire way to end this ongoing battle is upgrading to paid hosting and real accounts per Mojang's policy. It's understandable if budgets are tight, yet investing a small amount now can help preserve what was built and avoid constant disruptions down the line. With some adjustments, their vision for a smooth Minecraft experience yet again becomes achievable.
### Continuing to Improve Server Security Over Time  
No online community is completely hack-proof. New exploits will always arise requiring attentive oversight. However, proactive measures like migrating to a commercial host, implementing thoughtful **access control policies**, and staying on top of potential **vulnerabilities** put ownership in a much stronger position long-term. Beyond immediate threats, establishing best practices now fosters sustainable growth while giving players confidence their experience will remain disruption-free. With maintained vigilance and further refinements as challenges emerge, what was once a constant struggle could transform into a safe haven for the community to build and play together for seasons to come.
