### Receiving the Board Results Earlier than Expected
I was enjoying my short vacation after completing my 12th board exams conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). One day, my friend called me to check the official CBSE website. To my surprise, I came to know that the [CBSE 12th board exam results 2022](https://store.fi.io.vn/cute-axolotl-funny-i-axolotl-questions-salamander-265/women&) would be announced in just 14 days, much earlier than expected. I was not terrified because of the results but because my vacation was going to end soon.

### Playing FIFA to Reduce Anxiety of the Result Day
It was finally the result day. I woke up late and had around 5 hours before the results at 2 pm. To keep myself calm, I went to my friend's place to play **FIFA 2022** in his PlayStation. Little did I know that CBSE had another surprise for all of us. When my father angrily called me at 11:15 am to inform that the results were already out, I was shocked as CBSE had preponed the results announcement.
### Checking Friends' Results Before My Own 
I rushed to check the results on my friend's computer. Instead of checking my own, we first checked the results of our other friends. Finally, it was time to check my friend's results who had scored 84.2%. I was happy for him but also nervous to see my own marks. 
### The Pleasant Surprise of Becoming a Topper
With shivering hands, I entered my roll number. To my delight, I had scored above 90% in all subjects except English where I scored 90%. I was the class topper with an impressive overall percentage of 94.4%. I was shocked as I never expected to top the exam being an average student earlier.
### Dedicated Hard Work Paid Off
I had scored below 80% in 10th boards. However, I worked tirelessly, day and night to improve. Criticism motivated me to work harder. My success teaches that **board exam marks don’t decide one’s future**. With interest and dedicated efforts, achieving good scores is possible for anyone.
### Part 2 - Experiencing the Ups and Downs of Reevaluation and Rechecking
### Disappointment in Physics Score Led to Reevaluation
While I was preparing for JEE in Kota, I came to know about my CBSE 12th results. I scored above 90% in most subjects but was disappointed with my 73% in Physics. On a friend's suggestion, I applied for reevaluation hoping some marks will increase.  
### First Surprise - Minor Increment in Marks 
After a few days, I received a notification with my marks increased by just 1-2. Feeling it was less, I decided to go for rechecking despite cautions from others. 
### Second Surprise - Unexpected Major Increment 
To my surprise, after rechecking few questions, I received a notification that my Physics marks have increased significantly. I was unable to believe that re-evaluation and rechecking could change results so much. In the end, I secured an overall percentage of 90.2%, achieving my dream score.
### Learning that Challenging Unsure Answers Pays Off
This experience taught me that **re-evaluation and rechecking of unsure answers is worth it**. It also showed that one should not blindly accept initial results and satisfy with minor gains. By challenging answers, I was able to enhance my score substantially in the end.
### Part 3 - Sharing My Success Story to Motivate Others 
### Gaining Recognition for My Academic Turnaround
My success story of becoming a topper from an average student received immense appreciation from everyone. Many messaged me seeking advice on how to improve scores like I did. 
### No Magic Tricks, Only Dedicated Interest and Efforts
In response, I clarified to all that **there are no shortcuts in studies**. Scoring requires true passion and focus in the subject of choice. Had I taken Science without interest, I would have failed for sure despite efforts.
### Board Marks Don't Define Your Future
Through my story, I wanted to convey to everyone that **10th and 12th board results are not life deciding**. With determination and hard work in fields of personal interest, one can achieve great heights irrespective of past scores. 
### Motivating Current Batch to Focus on Subject Interest
I hope my experience inspires students currently preparing for boards. My advice is to honestly identify true areas of interest and dedicate fully to them for best results. Board scores alone do not matter in long-term.
### Appreciation for Editorial Suggestions  
I appreciate editorial suggestions from **Tanumita Roy on Quora** that helped enhance my success story further to benefit many. Her guidance will inspire me for more positive writing.
