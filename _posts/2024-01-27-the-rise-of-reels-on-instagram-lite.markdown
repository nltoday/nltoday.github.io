### The Addition of Reels to Instagram Lite
Instagram has added the ability for users of the Instagram Lite app to view short video clips known as [Reels](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-matching-outfits-for-holiday-poodle-dog-christmas-tree-2). This comes as part of the continued development of Instagram Lite since its initial release in December 2020. Reels allows users on Instagram Lite to discover and view short entertaining video clips much like they can on the main Instagram app and competing platforms such as **TikTok**.

### How Reels Helps Drive Engagement for Creators
The introduction of Reels on Instagram Lite continues Instagram's efforts to court creators and compete directly with TikTok. **Short format vertical videos** have proven extremely popular for delivering engaging and shareable content in an easy to consume manner. Creators are able to produce, edit and publish these **Reels videos** or **TikToks** with minimal effort, driving widespread viewership and fame for many. Both platforms provide a revenue stream and business opportunities for those that can cultivate large engaged audiences around their **creations of short entertaining videos**.
### Explaining the Popularity of Short Video Formats
The sustained popularity of short video formats can be attributed to how well they suit our busy modern lifestyles. **Busier schedules and limited attention spans** have driven demand for content that can be enjoyed in **small bites on the go**. Services like Instagram Reels, TikTok and Snapchat Stories expertly meet this need by delivering a steady stream of **quickly digestible entertainment**. Gone are the days when audiences had time for long form videos or written articles. The ease of creation and viral distribution models employed have made short video the perfect format for today's audiences and businesses alike. 
### The Relaunch of Instagram Lite 
After the initial success of Instagram Lite in select emerging markets, Instagram rolled back the app in mid-2020. The company confirmed they would take learnings to develop an improved new version. With the addition of Reels to Instagram Lite, it seems Instagram is moving forward with plans to relaunch an updated Instagram Lite experience. Improvements like Reels integration **expand the app's functionality without bloat** making it more appealing for markets with data or hardware constraints. An official new version of Instagram Lite would hopefully reach a broader potential audience across developing regions.
### Learning from Past Successes with Lite Apps
Instagram is following a proven playbook with Instagram Lite that other tech giants have found success with. Companies like **Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Uber and Spotify** have all released lightweight app versions tailored for emerging markets. These **Lite apps optimize the core user experience** for low-power devices and unreliable networks common in developing regions. By tackling connectivity and hardware barriers, Lite apps open a companies services and business model to **over a billion potential new users**. With careful localization, Instagram Lite 2.0 could achieve major growth if rolled out widely. 
### Using the Web Version for Data Savings  
While an official relaunch of Instagram Lite remains uncertain, users concerned with mobile data usage have an alternative option. Instagram's desktop website provides full access to the Instagram experience over a web browser. By using the mobile web version rather than the full app, users can save on **precious mobile data**. The web version loads faster and lighter than the app, avoiding excess data consumption particularly important on slower connections or limited data plans common in emerging markets worldwide.
