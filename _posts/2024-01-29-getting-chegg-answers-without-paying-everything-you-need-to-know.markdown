Chegg provides study resources that can help students learn better, but its paid membership comes with a cost that not all students can afford. Here are some ways to potentially access Chegg answers and content without paying, along with important considerations:
## Asking Others for Help
Some students rely on community help from various sources to get Chegg answers without subscribing. 
### Getting Answers from Discord Channels 
[Certain Discord servers provide free Chegg solutions](https://yt.io.vn/collection/alewine) as a way to help fellow students in need. While convenient, quality and response times vary greatly based on volunteer availability.

### Leveraging Reddit for Assistance
On subreddits like r/chegg, some generous Reddit users offer to solve questions for free. However, there are no guarantees - it depends on who happens to be online at the time. 
## Bypassing Paywalls with Browser Extensions 
Some extensions allow circumventing Chegg's paywalled blurring on question pages. While this was more effective in the past, Chegg has since adjusted its systems to block most workaround attempts. 
### The Risks of Using Inspect Element

In the past, right-clicking "Inspect Element" could uncover blurred text. But Chegg now detect such tampering, potentially resulting in account restrictions or bans. It's generally not worth the risk for students.
## Asking Experts Directly for Help
Rather than anonymous forums, directly reaching out to subject matter experts (SMEs) can yield more reliable help. 
### Connecting with Former Chegg Tutors
People who were previously employed by Chegg as tutors may offer private assistance. However, availability depends on the individual and response times are not guaranteed to be immediate. 
## Best Approach - Consider Subscribing 
While workarounds provided temporary access, Chegg has continuously improved protections for paid subscribers. The most hassle-free way is likely subscribing, especially if help is frequently needed. Affordable student rates are available.
## Alternatives to Consider 
If Chegg's membership remains too costly, explore lower-cost or free alternatives that provide study help:
### Using Library Databases 
Many college libraries offer access to databases with practice problems, solutions manuals and textbooks. Some even include Chegg-like question functionality. 
### Forming Study Groups
Joining forces with classmates allows sharing resources and collaboratively working through challenges. Recording video study sessions for later review can also reinforce learning.
### Consulting Professors During Office Hours 
Professors are usually happy to clarify concepts, provide feedback and recommend additional learning materials during their scheduled help times. This is a great free resource students sometimes overlook.
### Leveraging Free Online Resources 
Sites like Khan Academy, YouTube tutorials and open-source textbooks cover many common topics at no charge. While not a complete replacement for Chegg, they offer supplemental learning support.
In conclusion, while workarounds provided temporary access, the safest approach is likely subscribing to Chegg or using other legitimate free/low-cost study supports if the subscription cost remains prohibitive. Overall, the goal should be learning through ethical means respecting intellectual property rights.
