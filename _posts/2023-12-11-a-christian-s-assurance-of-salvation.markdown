Humanity was born into sin due to Adam's disobedience, making it impossible to escape sin and judgment on our own. However, God in His love and mercy sent His Son Jesus Christ to redeem and deliver us. Through Christ's perfect life, atoning death, and resurrection, anyone who believes in Him is assured of eternal life with God in heaven - not hell. Let us explore further the certainty of salvation for Christians. 
### **God's Righteousness Imputed Through Faith**
All people are inherently sinners, unable to fulfill God's perfect law. The law merely revealed our sinfulness and condemned us. However, God sent Jesus to absorb the punishment for our sins through His crucifixion, so that those who believe in Him would be justified - declared righteous. When we trust in Christ's finished work on the cross, God credits His righteousness to us instead of our sins. Having been made righteous through faith alone, there is now no condemnation for the believer.

### [Perfected Through His Ongoing Work](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/aguillon) 
Though declared righteous positionally, believers still struggle with sin in their mortal bodies. But the Holy Spirit indwells Christians, progressively sanctifying them into Christlikeness. When we sin, His conviction leads us to repentance. Despite failures, God sees us as holy and blameless through Jesus. In heaven, we will be fully conformed to the image of His Son. Until then, the Spirit strengthens us to walk in obedience through daily surrender to His will.
### **Guaranteed By an Unbreakable Covenant**
God made an eternal covenant with believers, sealed by the blood of Jesus. If He punished believers again for sins already atoned for on the cross, it would make Christ's sacrifice meaningless. But God vindicated Jesus' finished work through the resurrection, demonstrating our full justification. Having been bought with such a high price, not even our lack of faithfulness can separate us from God's love. The Spirit is God's guarantee that He will complete the good work He began in us.
### **Eternal Life Promised by an Unchanging God** 
Scripture teaches us that God does not lie or change His mind. The gifts and calling of God are irrevocable. If salvation could be lost, that would mean God went back on His word. But He promised believers eternal life the moment we accepted Christ. As Creator of all things, God has the power to guarantee our everlasting security in Him. Nothing, including our failures, can overpower God's sovereign purpose to redeem and keep all those who are His. Our destiny is absolutely secured by an almighty and completely faithful Savior.
In conclusion, **a true Christian can have absolute assurance that they will never end up in hell**. This is because God alone saves through Christ alone, keeping all who are His by grace alone, received through faith alone as revealed in Scripture alone. The triune God - Father, Son and Holy Spirit - works in us both to will and to work for His good pleasure. Having begun a good work, He is faithful to complete it until the day of Jesus Christ. Our security rests not in ourselves, but solely on the unshakeable foundation of a covenant-keeping God.
