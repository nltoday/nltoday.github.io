### Understanding the Clues
Any riddle that involves mathematical relationships requires careful examination of the clues provided. The key is to avoid getting hung up on specific words and instead focus on the underlying relationships described. 
To solve this age riddle, the first step is analyzing the opening statement that provides the framework: "Your sister is now 9. She can only be half your age once." This establishes that there will be a single point in time where the sister's age is half of the brother's. 
The next clue notes the small age gap, indicating this occurred early. Taken together, these statements tell us we need to think about the possibilities for when the sister could have been half the brother's age given their current ages are provided.

### Calculating the Starting Point  
The riddle then gives the crucial starting information: "When you were 6 years old then your sister was half of your age." Breaking this down step-by-step:
- The brother was [6 years old](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/albee) 
- The sister's age was described as **half the brother's age**
- To calculate half of 6 is 6 divided by 2, which is **3 years old**
So at this point in time, the brother was 6 and the sister was 3. This establishes they had a **3-year age gap**.
### Applying the Age Gap
Knowing the sister was 3 years younger than the brother when he was 6 years old allows us to use the constant 3-year difference going forward. 
The riddle tells us the current age of the brother is 12 years old. If the sister is always 3 years younger, she must currently be 12 - 3 = **9 years old**.
By systematically analyzing each clue and **calculating the mathematical relationships** between the ages at different points in time, the riddle can be solved logically without fixation on any single term.
### Double Checking the Work  
It's important when solving riddles to re-examine the work to confirm the solution is consistent with all the information provided. Let's double check:
- Brother's age now: **12 years**  
- Sister was **half brother's age** when he was 6
- Half of 6 is 3
- So sister was **3 years old** then
- They had a **3-year age gap**
- Sister is **always 3 years younger** than brother
- If brother is now 12, sister must be 12 - 3 = **9 years old**
All details line up, providing confidence the riddle has been solved correctly through an analytical, step-by-step mathematical approach.
### Applying the Methodology
This example highlights an effective methodology for solving **age-related riddles** with subtle mathematical puzzles:
1. Carefully analyze all clues and statements 
2. Identify relationships that can be calculated
3. Establish a starting point with specific ages
4. Determine any constant differences revealed
5. Apply differences to arrive at required unknowns
6. Double check the logic and calculations
By maintaining a focus on the mathematical reasoning instead of individual terms, riddles like this can be solved in a logical, systematic fashion. With practice, this discipline helps develop **rigorous critical thinking abilities.**
