The AMD Ryzen 3 3400G is a budget-friendly desktop processor that comes with integrated Vega graphics, taking the place of a discrete graphics card. While its integrated graphics capabilities are impressive compared to previous generations of APUs, it still cannot match the performance of a dedicated graphics card. Can the integrated Vega 11 graphics of the 3400G handle popular games like Apex Legends and if so, at what settings? Let's break this down part-by-part:
### Low-End Gaming Performance 
For lighter games like [Minecraft](https://store.fi.io.vn/work-hard-so-my-st-bernard-live-a-better-dog-lover-2), the 3400G can **easily deliver 60+ FPS** at 1080p resolutions with settings turned up. **Minecraft** is less graphically intensive compared to **AAA games** released in recent years, so it runs very smoothly on integrated graphics. However, for more demanding titles, significant compromises have to be made.

### Playing Apex Legends at Lower Resolutions
To get a playable experience in **Apex Legends** on the 3400G, resolution would need to be set to 720p for the **best chances** of maintaining above 60 FPS averages. At this lower resolution, settings could target medium presets. Some occasional dips below 60 FPS shouldn't be unexpected during hectic combat scenes though. 720p offers that performance boost required to stay above 40 FPS minimums.
### High-Resolution Gaming Not Practical 
Bumping the resolution up to native 1080p displays drastically reduces performance potential. Trying to play **Apex Legends** at this higher resolution even on low settings would yield averages around 30-40 FPS, dipping lower during action. This fluctuating framerate makes for an unenjoyable experience. **1080p gaming** is really pushing the limits of the 3400G's integrated Vega 11 graphics. Stick to 720p or lower for smoother gameplay.
### Comparable Budget GPU Needed for 1080p
To consistently achieve above 60 FPS averages at native 1080p resolutions in newer titles like **Apex Legends**, an entry-level discrete graphics card like the Nvidia GTX 1650 would be required. This GPU is in the $150 price range which is comparable to some budget 3400G builds. The performance uplift is huge versus integrated graphics alone. Pairing a 3400G with a basic $100-150 graphics card enables true 1080p gaming potential.
### Best Settings and Performance Expectations  
Summing it up, the 3400G can run **Apex Legends** at 40+ FPS averages if targeting 720p resolutions and medium-low settings. For 1080p, aim more toward 30-40 FPS on low presets. Minecraft Java edition performance will be stronger, delivering 60+ FPS at 1080p. Overall, the 3400G shows what's possible with integrated graphics but a basic dedicated GPU is needed for true 1080p gaming of recent titles like Apex Legends above 60 FPS. Pairing the 3400G with a low-cost video card enables much stronger performance.
### Upgrading for Higher Performance
For those wanting to play newer games at higher resolution and quality presets consistently above 60 FPS, it's necessary to look at **upgrading the graphics subsystem**. Options include pairing the 3400G with a stronger **mid-range GPU like the GTX 1660** for around $200-250 or choosing a processor with a faster integrated graphics solution such as Intel's Core i5-10400 or AMD's Ryzen 5 3500X. Building a gaming PC around a discrete graphics card generally provides the best long-term value and higher performance headroom too.
### Conclusion - Integrated Graphics Capabilities and Limitations
In summary, the integrated Vega 11 graphics of the AMD Ryzen 3 3400G processor show what's achievable through modern APU technology. It allows basic gaming like **Minecraft** at 1080p 60+ FPS. However, more demanding titles require compromises, with 720p resolutions and low settings needed to target 40+ FPS averages in **Apex Legends.** For truly enjoying newer games at high-resolutions and quality presets above 60 FPS consistently, a dedicated budget graphics card or faster CPU integrated graphics is necessary. Pairing the 3400G with a GTX 1650 or better unleashes its full 1080p gaming potential.
