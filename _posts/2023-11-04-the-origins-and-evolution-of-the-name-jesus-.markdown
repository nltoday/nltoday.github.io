The use of the name "Jesus" in the English language has a long and fascinating history that traces back thousands of years. Let's explore the origins and evolution of this important name.
### The Original Hebrew Names
The original Hebrew name given at birth to who would later be known as Jesus was [Yehoshua bin Yosef](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/aldinger), which translates to "Yahweh is salvation" or "Yahweh saves". This name was occasionally written in its abbreviated form as **Y’shua**. Both of these ancient Hebrew names predate the name "Jesus" by over two millennia.

### Transliteration into Greek
When the New Testament was originally written in Greek, the Hebrew name Yehoshua was transliterated into the Greek as **Iesous**. The Greek letters did not have exact equivalents for some Hebrew phonemes, so the name was adapted while still maintaining core elements of the original pronunciation.
### Translation to Latin
As Christianity spread throughout the Roman Empire, the Greek name Iesous was translated into Latin. This resulted in the spelling **Iesus**, which maintained fidelity to the original Greek transliteration as much as possible within the phonetic constraints of Latin. 
### The Advent of the Letter "J" 
In Medieval English, there was no distinct "j" sound, and this letter was not commonly used. The Latin Iesus became Anglicized as **Iesus** in Old English. It was not until the 12th century that Norman French brought the "j" sound to England. **Iesus** slowly morphed into the modern **Jesus** between the 12th-15th centuries.
### Establishing the Modern English Spelling 
While some early English Bibles spelled the name **Ihesus** or **Iesous**, the spelling "Jesus" became standardized in the 17th century King James Version. Ever since, this English rendering has become ubiquitous in literature and wider culture across the world. However, it remains a transliteration, several steps removed from the original Hebrew names **Yehoshua** and **Y’shua**.
### Honoring the Historical Continuity
When discussing Jesus in religious or historical contexts, using his original Hebrew names **Yehoshua** or **Y’shua** helps maintain continuity with his Jewish roots and upbringing. At the same time, "Jesus" as the English name remains appropriate for general audiences. Striking a balance honors both the ancient tradition and modern conventions surrounding this profoundly influential figure.
### Moving Beyond Surface Translations 
While names are important, it's equally crucial not to get caught up solely in superficial translations and miss the deeper spiritual meanings. The essence of Jesus' message transcends languages and cultures. His core teachings of love, justice, compassion and nonviolence resonate as powerfully today as when he first proclaimed them two millennia ago.
I hope this overview provided useful insights into the fascinating linguistic evolution of the name "Jesus" from its ancient Hebrew beginnings to its modern English form. Understanding the historical progression helps connect us more profoundly to the roots and early followers of this figure who changed the world.
