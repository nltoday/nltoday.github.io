### A Young Love Blossoms 
I still remember my first crush in 9th standard. [young love high school](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/chihuahua) Her name was Amrita and we would spend hours chatting during break times. One day, I gathered all my courage and confessed my feelings for her. To my surprise and joy, she said she felt the same way. We spent the rest of the year discreetly holding hands under the table and sharing shy smiles across the classroom. Those innocent memories of newfound love and puppy affection are imprinted in my mind even after all these years.
