## Keeping the Hope Alive
Despite facing continuous failures in the past three attempts, I have not lost hope. NEET is a challenging exam and it's not easy to crack in the first few attempts itself. Many top scorers also take multiple drops before achieving success. What's important is to learn from our mistakes and improve with each attempt. 
Giving up is not an option for me. I want to fulfill my dream of becoming a doctor and make my late mother proud. Her memories are what keep me motivated during difficult times. Though it has been a tough journey so far, **I have decided to work even harder with a positive mindset and focused preparation.** Success will come for sure if I keep persevering.
## 2020 Attempt: Learning the Ropes
My first attempt in 2020 was more of getting familiarized with the NEET exam pattern and questions. Due to the pandemic, my class 12 board exams were also disrupted which affected my preparation. I could only manage to score 245 marks. **However, it was a valuable learning experience which helped me understand NEET's assessment style and level.** 
Though the result was disappointing, I was not demotivated. I realized the areas I needed to improve like dedicating more time to self-studies, identifying weak topics and focusing on them. This attempt taught me the importance of subject-wise time management during the exam.
## 2021 Attempt: Battling Adversities  
The next year brought personal challenges as I lost two family members in a short span of time. It was an emotionally draining phase for me. Yet, I did not let it affect my preparation and gave my best through self-studies. 
Despite the trying circumstances, I improved my score to 399. It gave me confidence that with **focused efforts and resolving external disturbances, much better results were possible.** The hardships also made me stronger internally to face future setbacks bravely.
## 2022 Attempt: Falling Short
This year, I joined offline coaching with high hopes. However, due to workload, I could not give required time for revision in the last month. On the exam day, I wasted crucial time in two sections due to last-minute panic. As a result, in my third attempt as well, I could score only around 500 marks.
It has been disappointing to see my efforts not translating to desired outcomes. But I understand, rushing at the end is no substitute for consistent preparation throughout. There were lapses, and **I aim to identify and rectify them for the future.**
## Moving Forward With Wisdom 
Taking multiple failures in stride is not easy, but giving up is not an option for me. I have resolved to continue preparing with renewed enthusiasm and rectifying past mistakes. **By addressing weak areas, minimizing distractions and practicing self-control, I am sure to get desired success very soon.**
Though it has been a tough journey so far, I have come a long way from my initial attempts. Experience has taught me invaluable life lessons of resilience, perseverance and maintaining an optimistic mindset even in adversity. My dream drive me forward and I will keep working hard untill I fulfull it.
