### Passive Income With Maps 
Within Minecraft, there is a huge community that creates custom maps for others to download and play. These maps take a significant amount of time and creativity to design. Since they provide entertainment value, some map creators have found ways to earn money from their work passively. 
[Minecraft map hosting websites](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-papillon-i-may-not-be-rich-and-famous-but-im-a-dog-mom-3) such as Minecraft World Map and Minecraft Maps allow creators to submit their maps for free hosting and distribution. These sites attract hundreds of thousands of downloads each month. While the maps can be accessed for free, some hosting sites offer "Premium" membership options that provide extra perks and support to those who pay a small fee. Map creators can apply to be part of these "Build Teams" and earn a small commission for each download their maps receive through the premium membership traffic. 
Another option is to add unobtrusive advertisements to maps before they are published. Sites like **Adfly pay creators a percentage** of the ad revenue generated whenever someone views or skips an ad to access a download link. For highly popular maps, this passive income can accumulate over time from the hundreds or thousands of downloads without needing constant active involvement.

After an initial investment of countless hours refining their tools, these programs license out for ongoing passive recurring revenue of **$100-500 monthly**.
