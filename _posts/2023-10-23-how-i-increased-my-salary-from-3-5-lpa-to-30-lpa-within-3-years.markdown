### Understanding My Journey and Goals 
After graduating with an ECE degree from a tier 3 college, I started my career with TCS earning a salary of 3.5 LPA. Although the salary was not very high, it was a stable job during uncertain times. However, I was ambitious and wanted a higher paying job that could support my goals. I decided to pursue [higher studies](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-holiday-dog-lover-funny-scottish-terrier-christmas-tree-2) and prepared for GATE to join a reputed Public Sector Undertaking (PSU). Despite multiple attempts, I was unable to secure a rank high enough. Feeling dejected, I decided to pursue an MTech instead to **enhance my technical skills** and career prospects.

### Gaining New Skills and Experiences through MTech  
I chose to pursue MTech from a top NIT near my home for stability during difficult times. The course helped me gain in-depth knowledge in **VLSI design** and embedded systems. During this time, I also interned at a leading **VLSI company** which offered me a job with a high CTC of 30 LPA after graduation. Accepting the offer was rewarding as it reflected the value of the skills I gained from my MTech. While it was a long journey, pursuing higher education helped me achieve my goal of securing a high-paying job.
### Settling into the New Role and Continuing to Learn
In my new role, I enjoyed learning advanced concepts in **digital circuit design** and **SoC development**. Within 6 months, I received a significant hike reflecting my contributions. However, I knew growth depends on continuously acquiring new skills. I took every opportunity to work on challenging projects, volunteer for additional responsibilities, and network with experts within the organization. This helped me gain recognition as a **subject matter expert** in my domain.
### Understanding the Industry Standards and Expectations  
Working in the industry opened my eyes to how compensation levels correlate withexperience, skills and value addition. I saw associates getting nominal hikes despite good performance, as they lacked key skills expected at senior levels. This inspired me to focus on **leadership, management and communication skills** beyond technical expertise alone. I realized the necessity to consistently take on ownership, train others and drive strategic initiatives for professional and financial growth.
### Navigating Multiple Career Transitions
After 3 years, I felt ready to take on a senior role but opportunities were limited in my current company. I started exploring options again and received offers with higher compensation from reputed companies. Weighing both responsibilities and compensation, I chose to join a startup as their Lead Developer. There, I enhanced my skills across **software development, sales, marketing and client management**. The company's success allowed substantial hikes. I then leveraged this experience to secure a manager-level position with an even higher salary. 
### Achieving Financial Stability and Success 
My focused efforts towards skill enhancement over 6 years helped me systematically increase my salary from an initial 3.5 LPA to over 30 LPA presently. The determination to continuously learn new technologies, programming languages, domains and soft skills paved the way for career progression despite facing rejections initially. With the right attitude and expertise, such significant growth is very much achievable for ambitious individuals. Overall, it was an enriching journey of personal development that also fulfilled my professional goals.
