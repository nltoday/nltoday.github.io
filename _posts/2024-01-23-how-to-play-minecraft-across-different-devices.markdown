Cross-platform play has been a major development in Minecraft that allows users on different platforms to connect and game together. This article provides a comprehensive guide on how to play Minecraft across Windows, mobile, console and other devices.
###The Evolution of Bedrock Edition
Minecraft was initially developed separately for different platforms like Java for PC/Mac and console editions for Xbox, PlayStation etc. **However, in 2017 Microsoft unified all non-Java versions under the Bedrock Edition** to enable cross-compatibility. This brought together mobile, Windows 10, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and virtual reality under a common codebase. 
While the legacy console editions were retired, players received free upgrades to Bedrock if they owned the game previously. Bedrock also standardized features and updates across devices. Now players on diverse platforms can seamlessly join worlds together for cooperative or competitive gameplay.
###Signing into Xbox Live on Bedrock
To play across platforms, you need to sign into Xbox Live on the Bedrock Edition of Minecraft. On Windows 10, this can be done from the main menu by clicking the profile icon. On mobile, sign in with the same Microsoft account used on Xbox One or Windows 10 during gameplay. 
**This associates your profile and worlds to your Xbox Live account, allowing access on any Bedrock-compatible system.** Some early mobile versions before 1.3.0.28 lack sign-in support but the current Play Store/App Store builds enable cross-platform play out of the box.
###Joining Worlds Across Devices  
Once signed in, you can join friends playing on other systems. To host a multiplayer world, start a new game or open an existing one then click the "Invite Friends" button. Your friends will receive invites through the universal friends list in Bedrock Edition.
Alternatively, you can join friends directly by entering their Xbox Gamertag or selecting them from the friends list. **This "Play Together Anywhere" feature revolutionized Minecraft by easily connecting households and communities across different platforms.**
###LAN Worlds for Local Devices
For ad-hoc local multiplayer, devices on the same network can also access each other's worlds via LAN (local area network) connection without an internet link. To enable, go to Multiplayer, select "LAN World" and your device will broadcast for nearby systems to detect and join. 
LAN connectivity works between two Windows 10 PCs, an iPhone and Windows Mixed Reality headset etc. However, it requires the platforms to be on the same WiFi network or connected directly through a mobile hotspot.
###Compatibility Across Devices
Full cross-compatibility exists between Windows 10, Xbox One, iOS, Android and Nintendo Switch editions of Bedrock. Players on these systems can play, chat and build together seamlessly. Virtual reality headsets like Oculus Quest and Gear VR also integrate with Bedrock for a shared VR multiplayer experience.
The one exception currently is PlayStation 4, which only allows play with other PS4 consoles. However, Sony has committed to implementing cross-play on their platform in the future. Otherwise all Bedrock devices work harmoniously to let friends enjoy Minecraft across any screens and interfaces together.
###In Summary
With Bedrock Edition unifying various versions under a single codebase, Minecraft has become a true cross-platform phenomenon. By signing into Xbox Live on supported devices and joining friends, communities can now freely cooperate, compete and build worlds without barriers between Windows, mobile, consoles and VR. This evolution has kept Minecraft's multiplayer experience vibrant and accessible to more players worldwide.
