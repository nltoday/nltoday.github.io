Everyone on Earth could fit inside the US state of Texas with plenty of space and living standards far greater than what most have today. Let's break this down further.
### Generous Living Space for All 
With Texas' total land area of 262,000 square miles, [converting this to square feet](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-pitbull-mom-funny-valentines-day-dog-lovers-bully-pitty-1-3) and dividing by the current global population of around 8 billion people gives **over 900 square feet per person**. Even a family of five would have **more than 5,400 square feet to themselves** - equivalent to a large home. **Some key facts**:
- Habitable land totals around 15 billion acres worldwide, equating to **over 2 acres per person** on Earth. 
- Standing shoulder-to-shoulder, the global population could form a line **over 4 million miles long** - well past the moon!

### Ample Housing for All in Texas 
Assuming all 8 billion people lived in **single family homes** in Texas, **each couple could have a 1,800 square foot house**. A typical size for a comfortable American home. 
For reference, an 1,800 square foot house would include:
- 3 bedrooms 
- 2 bathrooms
- Living room 
- Dining room  
- Kitchen and more
With **over 250,000 square miles to spare** after housing everyone, **there would still be room for large backyards, recreational parks and other amenities**. No one would need to live in cramped conditions.
### An Abundance of Resources 
As one of thelargest producers of food and energy in the US, Texas could **easily sustain the global population**. The state is a top region for:
- Agriculture - Including beef, cotton and crops like **corn, wheat and sorghum**.
- Energy - Texas leads in US oil and gas with abundant reserves to power homes and industries.
- Freshwater - The High Plains Aquifer and major rivers like the Colorado provide plentifulH2O. 
Desalination could also produce more if needed. With effective **population distribution and resource management**, wants and needs could comfortably be met.
### Prosperity and Opportunity for All 
Housing 8 billion within Texas' borders would create **unparalleled economic opportunities**. Massive industries and job markets would emerge to:
- Construct millions of new energy-efficient homes. 
- Develop extensive infrastructure like roads, rail, ports and internet/power grids.
- Expand agriculture, manufacturing, services and more to meet production and consumer demands.
With an abundant workforce, the global economy could **rapidly advance standards of living to first-world levels worldwide**. Poverty and lack would become non-issues through full participation and distribution of wealth on a massive scale.
### Promoting World Peace 
Some believe high population contributes to issues like resource conflicts, inequality and civil unrest. However, stabilizing world population within one manageable nation could help **address many social ills at their root cause**. 
By fostering understanding through close proximity and interdependence, prejudices may dissolve. Shared prosperity on an unprecedented scale could curb aggression and help establish **long-term global cooperation and peace**.
Properly planned and implemented, housing humanity in Texas presents an vision of not just practical but also ethical sustainability - one where all people's basic needs are met to their highest potential through ** cooperation rather than competition over limited supplies**. A model worth serious discussion and assessment.
