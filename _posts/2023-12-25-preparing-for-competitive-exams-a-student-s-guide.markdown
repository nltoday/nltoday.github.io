Never overcomplicate ideas - focus on grasping fundamental principles before moving on. Studying effectively means internalizing knowledge rather than just memorizing for exams.

Classroom learning paired with self-study is the most efficient approach.
### Review Past Papers Thoroughly

Exam boards commonly reuse questions, so practicing old tests is one of the best ways to anticipate what may appear on your paper. Studying prior exams thoroughly will boost your ability to accurately recognize patterns. Minimize rough work during practice - aim to work through questions mentally to mimic real test conditions.
