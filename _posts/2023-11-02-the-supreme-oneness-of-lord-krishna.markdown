Lord Krishna embodies oneness in its fullest sense. He is both everything that exists as well as nothingness. He is the creator and destroyer of the universe, the timeless soul of all beings. Yet to fully comprehend his divine nature is beyond human intellect. This dialogue seeks to offer a glimpse of Krishna's omnipresence through different experiences of time.
### A Mindblowing Concert
Imagine attending the best concert of your life. For two hours you are enthralled in a completely immersive experience that feels like [a different world altogether](https://yt.io.vn/collection/addy). Yet to your friend waiting outside, those same two hours pass by normally without any significant change. This shows how perception of time depends on level of engagement with circumstances. What seems like an eternity of bliss for one can be just a brief interlude for another.

### Time Stops for the Soul
Lord Krishna's conversation with Arjuna on the battlefield before the Mahabharata war is seen as a prime example. **To the supreme soul Krishna, time is utterly malleable**. As he commenced his divine teachings in the Bhagavad Gita, it is said that time itself paused. Only Arjuna, fully absorbed in Krishna, was able to experience the flow of their interaction lasting hours though in reality just moments must have passed. 
### A Friendship Across Many Lives  
Krishna and Arjuna were close friends who had interacted for 90 years over previous births before this war. Such was the depth of their bond that **telepathic communication between soul mates was almost ordinary**. Through perfect intimacy of spirit, the Gita discourse occurred simultaneously on multiple levels - physically spoken yet infinitely expanded beyond time. Each question Arjuna voiced revealed his innate understanding of Krishna's essence.
### Wondrous Mind, Divinely Inspired
Arjuna's remarkable intellect and concentration helped him perceive the **timeless wisdom imparted so concisely**. As a demigod blessed with superb weapons and a magnificent mind, he served as the ideal vessel for receiving Krishna's sublime teachings. Their discussion shows how one can transcend ordinary constraints of time through divine communion with the supreme soul.
### Eternal Observer Within 
Lord Krishna declares that he himself pens every thought and emotion that arises in any being. Past, present and future coexist for him in a single moment of observation. We fulfill our purpose simply by witnessing the unfolding of his limitless creation to the greatest degree possible. With attentive focus on even a sliver of its magnificence, one begins to glimpse the true nature of existence as constant worship of the divine.
