### Overview
Polypropylene Random Copolymer (PPR) pipes are made from PPR-C raw material. They are widely used for hot and cold water supply due to properties like corrosion resistance, high tensile strength and resistance to high temperatures. Let's discuss the key properties, applications and top manufacturers of PPR pipes in India.

### Chemical Resistance  
PPR pipes have [excellent chemical resistance properties](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-shirt-chihuahua-giftschihuahua-dad-mom-owner-chihuahua-lovers-gift-chihuahua-dog-owner-birthday-christmas-mother-of-chihuahua33-t-shirt). They can transport industrial chemicals, acids and other corrosive liquids reliably. The random copolymer structure of PPR makes the material highly impervious to dissolving or corrosion from chemicals. This property enables using PPR pipes for transporting various industrial chemicals in manufacturing facilities, refineries, and chemical plants.
### Temperature Resistance
PPR pipes can withstand high operating **temperatures up to 85Â°C**. Their temperature resistance property comes from the tough polypropylene material. This allows using PPR pipes for applications involving hot water distribution in industries, buildings and residential complexes. The pipes retain their structural integrity and do not get affected or damaged at high temperatures. 
### Tensile Strength
PPR pipes have a high level of tensile strength due to the crystalline structure and intermolecular forces in polypropylene. Their tensile strength enables them to withstand pressure conditions during transport or distribution of liquids through piping systems. The sturdy construction using reinforced PPR-C raw material gives pipes reliability for long term pressurized operation in industries.
### Low Cost of Installation
PPR piping systems have lower installation and labor costs compared to other piping materials. PPR pipes come with push-fit jointing systems that do not require welding or soldering. Connections are established quickly through push fittings, reducing man hours spent on joining pipes. The light weight of PPR also eases transportation and positioning of pipes during installation work.
### Durability and Operational Life
When installed properly, PPR pipes can last for over 50 years without losing structural integrity or developing leaks. Their chemical resistance and ability to withstand high pressure/temperature conditions results in a **very long operating life and minimal maintenance**. Installed PPR systems do not require periodic replacement like other piping materials. This translates to lower lifetime costs of ownership for end users.
### Usage in India
In India, PPR pipes find widespread application in industrial sector, construction industry and building sector. They are commonly used for **industrial piping, plumbing applications and chemical transportation** where properties like corrosion resistance and strength are essential. Some key uses of PPR pipes in the country include plumbing, underground pipelines, portable water tanks, and industrial process piping.
### Key Indian Manufacturers
Some leading manufacturers of PPR pipes in the Indian market include Finolex Industries, Astral Poly Technik, Supreme Industries, Prince Pipes, and Jain Irrigation Systems. Brands like **Finolex Blue** and **Supreme Everlast** offer a wide range of PPR-C pipes with diameters from 20mm to 630mm. These companies dominate the PPR segment with strong pan-India distribution and production facilities.
### Conclusion
With outstanding material properties, PPR pipes have emerged as a preferred choice for plumbing as well as industrial piping applications. Their corrosion resistance, durability, ease of installation and competitive pricing make PPR an attractive piping material. Going forward, the PPR pipe market in India is expected to grow further driven by increased application in construction, manufacturing and infrastructure projects across the country.
