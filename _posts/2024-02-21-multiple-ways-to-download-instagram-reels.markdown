Instagram allows users to view and engage with entertaining short videos known as Reels. However, there is currently no built-in way to save Reels within the Instagram app. Fortunately, there are several effective third-party methods that let you download Instagram Reels for keeping or sharing offline. 
## Using Third-Party Websites 
Some websites make it simple to directly download Reels. **En.savefrom.net** is a popular option that works by copying-pasting the Reel URL. After pasting the link, the site generates a download button that saves the Reel file to your device. Alternatives like **ClipConverter.cc** function similarly with a simple process. These lightweight sites don't require registering accounts and let you quickly grab Reels.
## Reposta - A Handy App Solution
For smartphone users, the **Reposta app** provides an on-the-go method. First, copy the Reel link within Instagram and paste it into the Reposta interface. Then tap the save icon to download the video file straight to your camera roll. Reposta organizes saved content neatly for easy access later on. With over 10 million downloads, it remains a top choice among Instagrammers seeking simple Reel downloads.
## Using Third-Party Browser Extensions 
Browser extensions add handy saving features directly within your internet browser. The **Video Downloader for Instagram** extension lets Chrome and Firefox users right-click any Reel to save it. Meanwhile, those using Microsoft Edge can install the similar **Instagram Video & Image Downloader** add-on. Both simplify the process into just a few clicks without leaving the browser window.
## Screen Recording as a Backup Option
Screen recording your device provides a backup solution if the above methods don't work. On an iPhone, open the Control Center and tap the screen recording icon. Then play the Reel and it will capture the video. Android users can use the built-in Screen Recorder or third-party apps like **AZ Screen Recorder** to replicate the process. While less than ideal, screen recording ensures you can save Reels when other options fail.
## Using Third-Party Conversion Sites  
If you need to change a Reel file format, conversion sites get the job done. Sites like **OnlineVideoConverter.com** allow uploading Reel files for format changing. For instance, you can alter an MP4 Reel file to a different format like MOV. These are useful when a Reel needs editing in video software only compatible with certain codecs. Conversion preserves quality while adapting files as needed.
In summary, there are now reliable third-party methods available to download Instagram Reels for keeping or repurposing offline. With the right tools, you don't need to rely solely on Instagram's built-in features to save and access Reel content on your own terms.
