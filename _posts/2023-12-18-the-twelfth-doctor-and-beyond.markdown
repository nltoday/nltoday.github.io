### A Return to the Roots  
Peter Capaldi has brilliantly embodied the role of the Twelfth Doctor, bringing back a sense of the character's origins while putting his own unique stamp on the part. Where his immediate predecessors tended to be more romantic and goofy in their personas, Capaldi evokes the stern paternalism of William Hartnell's original Doctor. His sharp, insulting quips aimed at Clara further distance this Doctor's relationship with his companion compared to past eras. While it took Capaldi an episode or two to fully inhabit the role, he has stepped into it wonderfully and truly feels like [the Doctor](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/french-bulldog) now in a way not seen in a while. Getting back to a less romanticized vision of the Time Lord feels refreshing.

### Rethinking the Modern Era
The show faced some challenges as it was revamped for a new generation in 2005. While highly popular and successful overall, there was a tendency to shape the Doctor into more of an romantic hero appealing to older audiences. This perhaps went too far at times, such as with Amy Pond's controversial outfit. Recognizing this, the writers acknowledged a need to refocus on family-friendly themes. Explaining the personalities of Doctors 9 through 11 as responses to the program's evolution was a clever creative decision. Now under Capaldi, the pendulum has swung back towards Hartnell's style, prioritizing the character over romantic narratives in a way respectful of the show's origins.
### An Impossible Goodbye 
Clara Oswald's tenure as companion never fully lived up to her potential as **the impossible girl**. While her starring role grew too large at the expense of Matt Smith's Doctor, Jenna Coleman brought spirit to the part. Sadly, the intriguing clues about Clara's **time-traveling paradoxical existence** spun out from The Snowmen were never deeply explored. Her abrupt departure felt unfulfilling given these teases. Perhaps the next companion can be developed with more care and balance relative to the Doctor.
