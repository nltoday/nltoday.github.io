Additionally, using a **mobile internet connection** versus a wired one can impact performance due to bandwidth limitations.

### Trying Simple Fixes First
Before diving into more complex troubleshooting steps, some basic fixes are worth trying. Switching to a different Roblox account or recreating your account can potentially resolve account-specific conflicts. You can also try reinstalling the Roblox app to address software bugs. Testing the games on a different WiFi network is another simple test, as **network connectivity problems** are a common culprit. These easy steps may resolve the performance issues.
### Looking at Device and Network Settings 
If basic fixes don't work, take a closer look at device settings that could impact performance. On mobile, ensure graphics quality and effects are adjusted to lower settings in the app and device settings. Check for any software updates as well. For WiFi, confirm you have a strong signal and aren't experiencing interference. Test on cellular data versus WiFi to rule out network problems. Try moving closer to the router with less obstructions. Optimizing **device graphics settings** and your **network environment** could help improve performance.
### Contacting Roblox Support
If you've exhausted easy troubleshooting steps to no avail, the next step is reaching out to Roblox support. Through their support center, you can explain the specific issues and games/devices impacted. Roblox staff may need to gather additional system information to identify the root cause. In complex cases, they may recommend reinstalling the operating system or hardware upgrades. However, support will work with you to find solutions or workarounds when possible. Getting assistance from **Roblox customer support** should be your last resort after self-help doesn't resolve the performance problems.
### Summary

The best approach is starting with simple remedies like changing accounts, reinstalling apps, or testing on different networks. If needed, optimize device graphics, network settings, or contact Roblox support. With some troubleshooting, you should be able to identify and address the underlying technical cause, allowing you to enjoy Roblox games smoothly again.
