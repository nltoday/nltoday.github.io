### Traditional Astrological Points
When considering marriage, it's important to check various astrological points in the bride and groom's horoscopes. Some key traditional points to analyze include:
### Ascendant (Lagna)
The Ascendant, or Lagna, represents the self and how one comes across. Compatible Ascendants between partners help ensure smooth interactions and understanding between them.
### Moon Signs 
The Moon signifies the mind and emotions. Moon signs of the bride and groom should be compatible to ensure emotional stability and fulfillment in the relationship.
### Sun Signs
ruled by the Sun represents the soul and core self. Similar Sun signs promote empathy, shared interests and a solid partnership between spouses.
### Advanced KP Astrology 
Modern KP astrology provides even more insights into compatibility. Key KP points that should be examined include:
### KP Astrology Birth Charts
The KP or "Krishnamurti Paddhati" system maps out planets in a more granular way. Analyzing the KP charts of both individuals reveals subtle compatibilities and incompatibilities.
### Planetary Strengths and Debilitations
Strong, exalted or debilitated planets can impact one's personality and relationship dynamics. KP considers planetary strengths and weaknesses.

A comprehensive astrological analysis also looks beyond individual charts to the connection between them:
### Synastry between Charts
How do the Ascendants, moons, suns and other planets interact when the charts are overlayed? Synastry reveals challenges and advantages in a marriage.
### Longevity and Health Outlook
Assessing longevity as suggested by the charts helps get a sense of pillars of support for each other in later life stages. 
### Checking for Troublesome Indicators
While having faith in destiny, it's also important to screen for any signs of troubled times ahead:  
### Criminal Tendencies
Although rare, some planetary combinations could hint at behavioral issues. It's worth vetting charts for any such tendency.
### Balancing Afflictions 
If either chart has major afflictions like **_Kuja Dosha_** or **_Rahu-Ketu defects_**, matching with someone with complementary afflictions helps balance out difficulties.
### Following Expert Guidance
An experienced astrologer can help navigate these complex analyses. The conclusion should be:
### Dosha Samyam, not Papa Samyam
If compatibility factors overwhelmingly outweigh any minor afflictions, then the match can be blessed as"Dosha Samyam" (afflictions balanced out) rather than termed "Papa Samyam" (under affliction).
Overall, a holistic, nuanced reading of both traditional and advanced astrology can provide powerful guidance for selecting a compatible life partner. But above all, keeping an open and positive mindset is most important.
