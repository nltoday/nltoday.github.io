### Getting Help at the Bank
Adding a beneficiary to your TD Bank account is a simple process that starts with a visit to your local TD Bank branch. When you arrive, let the teller know that you want to designate one or more beneficiaries for your checking or savings account. 
A TD Bank representative will be able to help guide you through the process. They will provide you with the necessary paperwork and inform you of any documentation required, such as the beneficiary's name, address, date of birth, and social security number.

Because beneficiaries have no control or access to the account funds until after the account holder passes away, their signature is not required when being added. The account holder, also known as the signer or owner, is the only one who needs to initiate and submit the beneficiary changes.

### Completing the Designation Form  
Upon requesting the necessary forms from the bank representative, you will receive a **TD Bank beneficiary designation card**. This card allows you to specify the individuals you want to receive the remaining funds in your checking or savings account after your death.
Carefully fill out all sections of the card with the requested information for each beneficiary. Be sure to include their full legal name, current residential address, date of birth or tax identification number. You will also need to indicate what percentage of the remaining funds each beneficiary should receive. 
Once completed, review the form to ensure all information is accurate. Then sign and date it before returning the card to the bank representative. They will submit it for processing and update your account details accordingly.
### Beneficiary Rights and Access
While a beneficiary provides instructions for how the bank should distribute remaining funds after the account holder passes, they have no access or control over the account during the owner's lifetime. A beneficiary cannot make withdrawals, sign checks, or receive a debit card tied to the account. 
All management rights remain with the signer or owner. The beneficiary designation simply ensures the bank distributes the funds as instructed by the account holder in the event of their death. This provides peace of mind knowing loved ones will be provided for as intended.
### Adding Multiple Beneficiaries
Most TD Bank accounts allow the designation of multiple beneficiaries. This provides flexibility in terms of how funds should be distributed. For example, an account holder may wish to split their balance evenly among their children. 
When adding multiple beneficiaries, follow the same process of filling out a beneficiary designation form. But rather than entering details for a single person, include the requested information for each intended beneficiary on the form. Be sure to clearly indicate the percentage or portion of the remaining funds each should receive.
With multiple beneficiaries, the distribution is handled according to the specified percentages or amounts - even if a beneficiary is deceased. Unless alternate or contingent beneficiaries are named as well, their designated portion would become part of the estate.
### Designating Contingent Beneficiaries
For additional security, a TD Bank account holder can appoint contingent beneficiaries. These are secondary recipients specified to receive the remaining funds if the primary beneficiary is unable or unwilling to claim their portion.
Common scenarios where contingent beneficiaries would receive the funds include if the primary beneficiary predeceases the account owner or disclaims their interest in the funds after the owner's death.
To name contingent beneficiaries, follow the same process used when designating primary recipients. Simply use a new beneficiary designation form and clearly mark any secondary selections as "contingent beneficiaries." Provide all their identifying details and the percentage of the account they should receive.
Having contingent beneficiaries ensures the account owner's final wishes are still carried out, even if the first selections are unable or choose not to receive the funds. It provides a safety net for proper distribution of any remaining balance.
### Ensuring a Smooth Transfer of Funds  
Properly filling out the TD Bank beneficiary designation form and keeping beneficiary details up to date makes the transfer of funds seamless for loved ones after passing. The bank is then clear on distributing the account balance as intended by the deceased owner.
An annual review of beneficiary selections is recommended. Life changes like marriages, divorces or births may warrant updates. Notifying the bank of any changes ensures assets go where wanted. With proper planning and documentation, a TD Bank account can be used to thoughtfully provide for family even after death.
