### Setting the Scene
Palpatine sits alone in his office on Coruscant, drumming his fingers together in thought. Though seemingly in control of the Republic as Supreme Chancellor, unrest is growing in the galaxy. Rebel factions are forming to resist his Imperial ambitions. **If left unchecked, these separatist uprisings could undermine his authority and threaten his grand plan for total domination.** He needs the Jedi distracted from the growing shadow in the Senate so he can consolidate more power. Rumors of a new Sith Lord gaining influence in the Outer Rim could prove useful...

### An Old Friend Returns
On Tatooine, Owen Lars is in the marketplace bargaining with traders when he notices a familiar cloaked figure entering the bustling streets. "Obi-Wan?" he calls out in surprise. The Jedi master turns and smiles. "It's been too long, my friend. I've come searching for Anakin, I was hoping you might know where I could find him." Owen's expression darkens. "Anakin is long gone, Obi-Wan. After what happened to Shmi..." He trails off sadly. Obi-Wan nods solemnly. "I had hoped it wasn't true. Please, tell me what you know."
### A New Apprentice
After leaving Owen, Obi-Wan goes searching the streets of Mos Espa. He spots a [teenage human boy](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/abundis) working diligently on a Moisture Vaporator. "You must be Cliegg Lars' stepson. I'm looking for information about Anakin Skywalker." The boy glances up warily. "Most folks don't ask about him anymore. What do you want to know?" Obi-Wan studies him thoughtfully. "Your skill with machines is impressive. Have you ever considered leaving this life behind? I may have an... opportunity for you, if you're interested."
### Shadows in the Senate 
Unbeknownst to the Jedi, Darth Sidious secretly meets with a **mysterious figure cloaked in shadow**. "The time has come to reveal yourself, my new apprentice. With the Jedi distracted, together we will strike against the Republic. But first, we must sew more chaos and discord. Seek out the Toydarian junk trader on Tatooine. Use him to start a conflict the Jedi cannot ignore." The shadowy figure bows. "It will be done, my Master." His blazing yellow eyes glow faintly in the darkness. 
### A Glimmer of Hope
Obi-Wan arrives at the Lars homestead with the boy, now called "Ben." Owen eyes them warily but invites them in. That evening, Ben opens up to Obi-Wan about his life. "All I've ever known is slavery. Maybe if I learn the Force, I could help free others suffering like I did." Obi-Wan smiles. "You have a kind heart, Ben. With training and perseverance, perhaps you could." Ben smiles, a glimmer of hope shining in his eyes for the first time. Unbeknownst to them, a new dawn may be beginning.
### Shadow Games
On Tatooine, the dark figure confronts Watto at his junk shop. "The Trade Federation blockades a planet, yet the Republic does nothing. Perhaps new alliances could be... more agreeable." Watto's eyes gleam as credits change hands. "And what would you have me do?" The figure's eyes glow yellow in the shadows. "Inform your Toydarian connections. It is time to start a war." Meanwhile, on Coruscant, the Jedi Council senses a growing darkness. If only they knew the shadows had already begun to fall...
### A Spark is Lit
Alarms ring out as Queen Amidala's starship arrives at the Jedi Temple. The shadowy Sith apprentice watches from afar, his eyes glowing faintly. His plan is unfolding perfectly. With the Queen pleading for help, the Jedi will be drawn right into the conflict as intended. Now all that remains is to fan the growing flames of war into an all-consuming blaze that will leave the Republic crippled and ripe for the taking. The age of the Sith has begun...
### Stay tuned for more...
The battle for the Galaxy's soul has just started. What dangerous enemies will Obi-Wan, Anakin and the Jedi face as shadows descend? Can they uncover the true mastermind behind the growing conflict before it's too late? And will the past come back to haunt Ben, threatening the hope of a freer future? Tune in for the next exciting chapter as the journey to rewrite Star Wars: The Phantom Menace continues!
