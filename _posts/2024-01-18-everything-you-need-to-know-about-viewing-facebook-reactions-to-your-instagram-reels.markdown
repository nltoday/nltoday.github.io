Instagram Reels have become one of the most popular ways for creators to engage with their audience on social media. As Reels can now be shared to both Instagram and Facebook, many wonder how cross-platform sharing and visibility works between the two giant social platforms. This comprehensive guide will explain everything you need to know about viewing Facebook reactions to your Instagram Reels and optimizing your Reel content across Instagram and Facebook.
### See Total Reactions But Not Individual Profiles
When you view your Reel that was shared to Facebook from within the Instagram app, you will be able to see the total number of plays and likes it received on both Instagram and Facebook combined. However, you **won't be able to see the individual Facebook profile names** of those who liked or reacted to your Reel on Facebook. Instagram accounts can only view reactions from other Instagram users, including their usernames, comments and comment count from within the Instagram app.

### Leverage Facebook's Algorithms and Audiences  
While cross-posting Reels to Facebook from Instagram is convenient, it doesn't guarantee the same level of visibility and reach as creating **native Facebook Reel content.** Facebook and Instagram have separate algorithms that prioritize different types of posts. Sharing directly to Facebook allows you to better leverage the powerful Facebook algorithm and reach existing Facebook followers more easily. Native Facebook videos also have the potential to achieve wider distribution to audiences outside of your follower base.
### Optimize Reels for Each Platform
To maximize visibility across platforms, consider uploading your Reel videos **separately and optimizing each for the unique features of Instagram and Facebook.** Reels are vertically formatted for mobile on Instagram, but may not display as nicely on larger Facebook screens. Take advantage of Facebook-specific tools like video tags and titles/descriptions to better target relevant audiences. Cross-promote your Reels across networks by sharing teaser clips and links to drive traffic between platforms.
### Engage Facebook Groups and Communities 
Upload your Reels natively to Facebook and actively participate in relevant Facebook groups and communities related to your niche or content type. These dedicated discussion spaces allow you to directly engage interested fans and have your Reels recommended organically to similar audiences. Leverage hashtags within group posts and comments to boost discovery. With time and quality engagement, your Reels stand a higher chance of reaching new people beyond your core follower base.
### Continue Testing Various Strategies
As with any social media platform, success depends on continual testing to discover what works best for your specific goals and target audience. Experiment with different sharing, formatting and cross-promotion tactics. Track performance data like views, reactions and shares to identify high performing content. Pay attention to audience behaviors and fine tune your approach over multiple Reel creations. Persistence and optimization are key to utilizing Reels most effectively across Instagram and Facebook for business or creator purposes.
### Takeaways
In summary, while Instagram Reels shared to Facebook allow total reaction counts to be visible, individual Facebook reactions remains hidden from within Instagram. To maximize Reel visibility, consider uploading natively to both platforms and optimizing content accordingly. Leverage Facebook's video and community features to engage new potential fans beyond your core following. Consistent testing of different sharing and cross-promotion tactics can help identify the best strategies for your specific goals and target market when utilizing Reels across Instagram and Facebook.
