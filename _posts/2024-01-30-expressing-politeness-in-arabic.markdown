## Lutfan, Min Fadhlik, and Law Samaht 
There are a few common Arabic phrases used to express politeness when making a request. One is "Lutfan" which means "from your kindness". Similarly, "Min Fadhlik" translates to "upon your excellency" though it literally means "upon your choice". A less formal option is "Law Samaht" meaning "if you please". 
For example, to politely ask for a tissue you could say:
### From Your Kindness
**"Lutfan Hal Yumkin an tunawilany mindeel?"** 
"From your kindness, can you give me a tissue?"

### Upon Your Excellency  
**"Min Fadhlik Hal Yumkin an tunawilany mindeel?"**
"Upon your excellency, can you give me a tissue?" 
### If You Please
**"Law Samaht hal yumkin an tunawilany mindeel?"**
"If you please, can you give me a tissue?"
## Additional Politeness Phrases
For a more formal request, one could use "Astasmahuka" for a male or "Astasmahuki" for a female which means "I ask your permission". Less formally, "Law Samaht" and "Min Fadhlik" work for both genders. 
There is also a gender-neutral option of "Rajaaâ€™an" meaning "please". All of these convey respect when making a polite request.
### Please Stop Talking
**"Aarjok taqfu an al-kalam"**  
"I beg you, please stop talking"
### Do Not Enter Without a Mask
**"Rajanne, ladkhuwal bidun irtiy al-kamamah"**
"Please, do not enter without wearing a mask"
### I Would Like Some Water
**"Aridu baad al-maa, law samaht"**
"I would like some water, please"
## Expressing Politeness in Different Situations
The level of formality when making requests also depends on the situation. With close friends or family, the informal "Aarjok" is appropriate. However, "Rajanne" is best for formal settings like posted signs. The very formal "Yorja" is not generally used in casual conversations.
Restaurants commonly use "Law Samaht" to politely get someone's attention, like when wanting to ask for water. Market vendors may use slightly less formal phrases like "Min Fadhlik" with customers.
Overall, understanding the nuanced differences in Arabic polite phrases helps one communicate respectfully in any situation. Being able to adjust the language based on context shows cultural awareness and sensitivity.
