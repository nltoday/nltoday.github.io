### A Dollar and a Sandwich
It was a cold winter day in 2020 when I came across a homeless man on the streets of Philadelphia. He looked cold and hungry so I gave him a dollar from my wallet, hoping it could buy him something warm to eat or drink. However, he wanted more money from me. When I told him politely that I didn't have any more cash on me, he angrily called me "A typical greedy-ass white man." I was surprised and disappointed by his harmful assumptions and reaction. No good deed indeed goes unpunished. 
Later that day, I went to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia cafeteria to get some lunch, as my daughter was undergoing treatment there. I ordered an Italian hoagie sandwich but specifically asked for [no onions](https://store.fi.io.vn/dog-breed-schipperke-funny-s-for-dog-lovers348-2). The sandwich maker questioned my Italian and Philadelphia origins for not wanting onions, clearly making unfair judgments. When I reiterated my order minus onions, he passive-aggressively gave me a different sandwich piled high with extra onions instead. I was furious at his disrespectful behavior during such a difficult time.

### Unwelcome Encounters at the Airport
A few years later while traveling through Hong Kong International Airport, I overheard a rude remark from an American woman sitting next to me in the food court. As I quietly ate my noodles, she loudly commented to her husband about how "typical" and unsophisticated Chinese people are with their eating habits. She even considered contaminating my food, thinking I didn't speak English. I was appalled by her ignorant stereotyping and confront her directly in fluent American English. Her shocked expression showed she didn't expect to be called out. I reminded her to be more respectful of others in diverse multicultural settings. People should not make harmful assumptions or generalization based on appearances.
### Unlearning Biases through Open-Mindedness 
Both incidents revealed how easily we can slip into judging or perceiving others through a narrow lens of preconceived biases. The homeless man, sandwich-maker, and American woman all jumped to conclusions and stereotyped without real understanding. As a society, we must work to unlearn harmful tendencies and pursue more empathetic, nuanced perspectives. Exposure to diverse array of ideas and cultures through education, media, and first-hand experiences can help broaden mindsets. With open-mindedness, we gain insights into one anotherâ€™s humanity beyond surface attributes and interactions. Promoting inclusion means leaving biases at the door to embrace commonalities over differences.
### Speaking out against Intolerance  
While discrimination persists, standing up to intolerance remains important. In the airport encounter, directly addressing the insult ensured accountability and set a positive example. Silence can allow prejudices to fester unchecked. At the same time, correcting unjust assumptions through respectful dialogue rather than reaction seeks understanding over conflict. As future leaders, we must advocate for dignity and fairness through courageous yet non-violent civic participation. Together we can oppose the "othering" of individuals and advocate for just, compassionate communities where all people feel empowered and belong. With open and brave discussions, we move closer to the day when no one fears cruelty due to immutable attributes like race, religion or background.
### Nourishing Hope through Connection
Moments of discrimination can leave one feeling bitter or withdrawn. However, history shows the power of turning pain into purpose through non-violent action. We must nourish hope by connecting across divides. As with the homeless man, recognizing our common humanity despite adversity creates opportunities to uplift one another. Small kindnesses plant seeds, and supporting organizations that alleviate suffering inspires positive change. Through shared experiences of breaking bread, playing together, learning from diverse role models and celebrating cultural heritages, children naturally embrace diversity. Nurturing such inclusive environments ensures the next generation envisions a just, compassionate world without bias as the norm.
### A Call for Empathy, Understanding and Allyship 
To overcome prejudice, empathy, understanding and allyship are crucial. We betray our shared hopes for equality when leaving "the other" to face discrimination alone. The story highlights how assumptions inhibit empathy - to truly see another, we must check biases, listen with an open heart and correct ill-informed perceptions respectfully. As privileged groups, it is our duty to educate less aware members, stand up for the marginalized with courage but also care, and center impacted voices. By acknowledging oppressive systems that enable harmful behaviors, and examining our own roles in perpetuating them, no matter how unconsciously, we take responsibility. With diligent self-reflection and advocacy that uplifts human dignity for all, a more just future becomes attainable.
