### The Witcher Trials  
Geralt was but a child when he was brought to the witcher keep of Kaer Morhen. Only boys showing aptitude for the trials were selected, and they faced a cruel fate. A potion brewed from mysterious grasses was injected into their veins, putting their small bodies through unspeakable agony. **Only a handful survived this first trial, called The Trial of Grasses.** Those who endured its tortures received mutations that enhanced their bodies and senses, turning them into fearsome monster hunters. But the price of this power was high.

### Bond of Destiny 
One boy who survived the Trial of Grasses was Geralt. During his long years of training, he endured punishing regimens to hone his fighting skills and learn the ways of a witcher. Yet perhaps his hardest lesson was in destining. By ancient law, a witcher who saves a soul must claim his bond - a child of surprise, given without knowing what or who it will be. When Geralt saved the life of the sorceress Yennefer, this was his reward. Though destined to meet, their bond was one of passion, pain and sacrifice. 
### A Witcher's Calling
With his grueling training complete, Geralt took on contracts to hunt the ferocious beasts that stalked the world of men. As a professional monster slayer, he remained apart, seeing humans as more monstrous than the creatures he stalked. Yet some souls could see past his cold facade to the [honorable man within](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-matching-funny-santa-riding-shetland-sheepdog-christmas-3-2). Principessa Cirilla befriended him, finding solace in her time with the White Wolf. And through their adventures together, Geralt learned that some bonds are worth fighting for above all else.
### TheGathering Storm  
Dark times were coming to the north. The Nilfgaardian Empire sought to expand its dominion, plunging the lands into war. In the midst of this conflict, Geralt learned of an even graver threat - the growing power of the Wild Hunt, an otherworldly force that stole men's souls. As bands of marauders pillaged the countryside and armies clashed on the fields, Geralt searched for Ciri, who possessed a power coveted by kings and demons alike. The path towards the gathering storm would test his steel, his wits, and his belief that even in the face of armageddon, an **honorable man can make a difference**.
### Destiny's Choice
Geralt's travels led him to a dying sorcerer who revealed Ciri's fate was intertwined with that of the world. As the flames of war spread, Geralt pursued every lead to find the girl he saw as a daughter. Yet Ciri was trappeed in a deadly game, caught between malevolent powers that wanted to use her gift or destroy her. In a final clash, Geralt faced those who sought to kill Ciri or enslave her potentials. Through courage, compassion and sheer force of will, Geralt helped Ciri defeat her demons and **embrace her destiny on her own terms**. Though the battle was won, new challenges await on the long road to recovery and redemption.
### A Witcher's Legacy 
With peace restored to the land, Geralt aided the surviving orphans left by the ravages of war. But a witcher's life is one of wandering, and new contracts called him from his friends once more. Though he remained haunted by regrets of the past, Geralt held fast to the creed that guided his footsteps - a witcher fights for no kingdom or creed, merely to destroy the evils threatening man's world. Yet through his trials alongside Principessa Ciri and Yennefer, Geralt perhaps learned that some battles are won by more than steel alone. The **ripples of his choices would inspire new generations of witchers and ordinary souls alike**. Though his story may end, his legacy of courage, conviction and compassion would endure down the ages.
