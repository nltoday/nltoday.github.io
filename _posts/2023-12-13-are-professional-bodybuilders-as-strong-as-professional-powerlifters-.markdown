### Genetics and Training Goals Shape Athlete Physiques  
Bodybuilding and powerlifting are both strength sports, but the goals of each shape how athletes train their bodies. Bodybuilders focus on muscular size, symmetry, and low body fat to be aesthetically pleasing on stage. While genetics play a role, bodybuilders achieve a lean, chiseled physique through controlled diets, intense weight training, and sometimes performance enhancing drugs (PEDs). Powerlifters aim to lift the most weight possible in three disciplines: squat, bench press, and deadlift. They prioritize strength over appearance, eating large amounts of calories and protein to fuel intense training. As a result, powerlifters tend to carry more muscle and weight than bodybuilders.

### Diet and Training Routines Optimize Physiques for Different Sports
A typical bodybuilder consumes a low-calorie, low-carb, and low-fat diet to stay lean for competitions. Some bodybuilders limit daily calories to around 2,000-3,000 calories as they sculpt their physiques. In contrast, elite **powerlifter Eddie Hall eats a staggering 10,000 calories daily** to support his training. This allows powerlifters to gain weight and put on more muscle mass, even if it impacts their appearance. Bodybuilders perform higher reps with moderate weights, emphasizing muscle shape. Powerlifters focus on lifting as much weight as possible in lower reps to develop pure explosive strength for competition lifts. As a result, powerlifters can lift substantially more weight than bodybuilders in squats, deadlifts, and bench presses.
### Performance-Enhancing Drugs Play a Role in Elite Strength Sports  
While some naturals compete at elite levels, performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) have become entrenched in professional strength sports. The extreme physiques showcased at the highest tiers often cannot be achieved without chemical assistance. Bodybuilders widely use anabolic steroids and hormones to optimize muscle growth and lower body fat. Powerlifters also employ PEDs like steroids to push strength ceilings and recovery limits. Sports drug testing has limited effectiveness, enabling juiced athletes to dominate leaderboards. However, a few elite bodybuilders like [Ronnie Coleman and Johnnie Jackson have proven](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/dog-mom) abilities as both bodybuilders and powerlifters due to rare genetic gifts and training methodology.
### Eugene Sandow Showcased Natural Human Strength Potential in the 1890s
In the pre-steroid Victorian era, strongmen like Eugene Sandow achieved impressive natural physiques through intensive training. Sandow set early strength standards and advocated scientific exercise methods. His muscular 181-pound frame showcased the limits of natural human potential through diet and exercise alone in that period. Had he access to modern PEDs, Sandow may have achieved an even greater physique. His era serves as a reference for natural potential absent performance-enhancing compounds. Most pro athletes today likely surpass what was achievable naturally in Sandow's day due to widespread PED use across all elite strength sports.
### Records Show Genetic Freaks Push Natural Limits, but PEDs Dominate Pro Sports 
Certain genetic anomalies like Naim Suleymanoglu seemingly defy natural limits by lifting over 3 times their bodyweight in cleans as a child. However, suspicions remain if even such phenoms continued competition drug-free. Record holder Eric Spotto bench pressed 722 pounds raw in 2013, but questions linger if injury-free success resulted from enhanced training. The 740-pound bench of current record holder Kiril Darychev displays his skeletal architecture more resembling I-beams than bone. 2012 saw the closest men's 100m Olympic final ever amid a surge of performances aided by pharmaceutical sciences. Performance-enhancing drugs now permeate many top athletic circles driven by prestige, money, and injuries from pushing natural limits.
### Conclusion: PED Usage is Ubiquitous, Forever Changing Athletic Standards
Performance-enhancing drugs have profoundly impacted strength sports and society's perceptions of human capabilities. Anabolic steroids were first synthesized in the 1930s and began filtering into various athletic circles through the following decades. Natural potential showcases like Eugene Sandow serve as reference points, yet PED advancements continually redefine what was considered possible. While drug testing occupies anti-doping efforts, PED usage remains entrenched across many pro sports where money, fame, and pushing the limits are at stake. Strict natural competitors do exist at elite levels through genetics or stubborn determination. However, performance-enhancing compounds have permanently altered 21st century athletic standards and expectations of the human physique.
