When Will Byers first went missing in season 1, it was later revealed that he had been trapped in the Upside Down after inadvertently opening a portal between the two dimensions. Within the grim parallel world, the Mind Flayer sensed Will and took advantage of his vulnerable state to establish its first foothold in the real world. By possessing Will's body and mind, the Mind Flayer was able to use him as a spy to learn more about Hawkins. However, thanks to the efforts of Joyce, Jonathan, Nancy, and Hopper, they were able to force the Mind Flayer out of Will before it could achieve more sinister goals.

With only a small fragment of its essence remaining after being expelled from Will, the Mind Flayer was still determined to invade the real world. In season 2, it began manipulating the situatiom from the Upside Down, using its psychic powers to influence Will and starting spreading its influence to others. Its end goal was to harvest enough human hosts to build itself a monstrous physical body made of flesh and bone. Tragically, over 30 residents of Hawkins were possessed and then sacrificed in gruesome rituals to provide the raw materials needed for the Mind Flayer's avatar.

### **The Army of the Flayed**
Those who fell victim to the Mind Flayer's possession became known as the **_"Flayed"_**. Through its control of their minds and bodies, the Mind Flayer was able to amass a growing army of hosts like Billy Hargrove and Heather Holloway to help further its invasion. The Flayed became little more than mindless drones, blindly carrying out the Mind Flayer's cruel bidding without hesitation or remorse. Entire families like the Holloways turned against one another as the Mind Flayer pitted them against the heroes of Hawkins in lethal clashes. Only through Eleven sacrificing her powers was the body of the Mind Flayer destroyed, though its essence retreated back to the Upside Down for the time being.
### **An Ancient Evil Entity**
Much is still unknown about the Mind Flayer's true origins, but it is understood to be an immensely powerful, primordial being that is native to the parasitic dimension of the Upside Down. There it has thrived for who knows how long, evolving immense psychic abilities that allow it to shroud Hawkins and infiltrate the minds of human and Demogorgon alike. Its motives seem to be simply feeding off psychically-attuned hosts like Will Byers to strengthen itself before attempting full-scale invasions of the real world. If ever allowed to achieve total victory, the Mind Flayer would stop at nothing to cover the planet under its sinister influence.
### **The Puppet Master Behind the Curtain** 
In season 4, it is revealed that the Mind Flayer has not been dormant in the Upside Down as once believed. Through its psychic bond with the human turned demon Vecna, the Mind Flayer was actually the one pulling the strings all along in Vecna's schemes to open new portals and end Eleven's life. While Vecna believed he had truly gained power and autonomy by massacring the Creel family, in reality he had been unknowingly dancing to the Mind Flayer's tune the whole time. With a new body now under its control through Vecna, the Mind Flayer was closer than ever before to fully invading Hawkins once more and enslaving humanity for its dark masters in the Upside Down. 
### **An Inescapable Psychic Menace**
No matter what obstacles are placed in its path, the Mind Flayer continues to prove itself an immensely cunning and resilient foe. Even after suffering body after body being destroyed, its essence lives on, able to reconstitute itself given enough time and psychic energy. As long as the Upside Down exists, so too will the Mind Flayer lurk within its treacherous realm, waiting to extend its tendrils of influence once more into the real world. Hawkins and its residents may have survived multiple brushes with the Mind Flayer so far, but it will never truly rest until the whole planet bows before its limitless psychic powers. The Mind Flayer is a terrifying reminder that sometimes the greatest enemies are not what we see, but rather the unseen forces that manipulate events covertly from the shadows.
### **Hope Against the Darkness**
While the Mind Flayer presents an extinction-level threat, there remains hope that its insidious plans can still be undermined. By understanding how it operates psychically and relying on heroes with powerful abilities of their own, such as Eleven and Vecna's new adversary One, the Mind Flayer's chokehold may potentially be broken. Strong bonds of friendship and family have also proven to give those resisting the Mind Flayer's control greater willpower and resolve. With continued vigilance, quick responses to reopen portals, and belief in human spirit, perhaps the people of Hawkins can learn to level the playing field against even cosmic horrors that prey upon minds from other dimensions. But the cost of failure would be too grave, so the battle must go on however long it takes.
