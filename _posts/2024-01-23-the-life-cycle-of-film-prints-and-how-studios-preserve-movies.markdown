### Managing Heat and Light to Project Movies 
Film projectors use intense light to project movie images onto screens. [Cinematography projection equipment](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-blue-chihuahua-dog-weightlifting-in-fitness-gym-chihuahua-dog) beam light through thin strips of celluloid film coated with light-sensitive emulsion to create movies. The heat from these bright projector lamps slowly damages film over time with repeated showings.

### Prints Wear Out After Theatrical Runs
Film prints were only built to withstand a limited number of screenings before the emulsion began to deteriorate. Typical theatrical runs in major movie theaters were enough uses to wear out prints. Additional showings at smaller second-run theaters might further damage prints until studios destroyed worn films.
### Climate Control Keeps Originals Safe in Vaults
To preserve the artistic works, studios archive original camera negatives and color separation negatives in climate-controlled film stores. These film **master preservation facilities** maintain strict temperature and humidity to prevent damage to irreplaceable negatives. When new prints were needed, studios made copies from the protected original negatives in the vaults.
### Recycling Residual Film Prints
Some worn prints endured secondary showings but ultimately reached the end of their lifecycles. Studios sometimes recycled prints still in fair condition by chemically wiping the old emulsion. This allowed limited film stock to be reused for new productions. Otherwise, thoroughly deteriorated prints were simply disposed to make space for newer titles.
### Loss of Movies When Studios Discarded Originals
Unfortunately, some movies were lost forever when studios haphazardly discarded original camera negatives and prints without proper archiving. Before innovations in film archiving and digitization, many films succumbed to damage from chemical degradation or physical decay in storage if left improperly shelved. When masters no longer existed, no replacement copies could be made.
### Advances in Film Preservation Saved Cinematic History 
Modern practices helped reverse some previous losses. Film archives now carefully store original components in climate-controlled vaults with backups. Some rescanned degraded films to new digital masters. Technological advances in film scanning and duplication enabled restoring films previously thought gone. Concerted preservation efforts salvaged many important classic works from cinematic obscurity.
### Theatrical Exhibition Remains Key for Studios
Today studios still depend on theatrical box office performance for profitability. Properly maintained film prints undergo regulated showings according to distribution schedules. After exhibition runs, studios retain negatives and separation masters securely in professional film archives. Regular monitoring and duplication refresh prints when needed to share films for generations to come.
