### Memories with Dad
It was 1986 when I was just 9 years old. One night, my dad came home early from work and told me we were going on a late drive. We went to the toy store to get me a new pair of [GI Joe binoculars](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-fauch-und-rottweiler-chaos-team-rottweiler-3-1) before they closed. Then we drove to an empty lot under construction where we could look at the stars. My dad taught me so much about space and life that night, looking up at the vast night sky. Though we didn't see Halley's Comet, the memory of stargazing with my father is one I will always cherish.

### Family Camping Trip
During my summers between ages 9 to 11, my parents would rent a cabin for two weeks each July at a lakeside camp in Lake George, New York. I remember the cozy cedar smell and feeling the soft pine needles and sand between my toes as I ran around barefoot the whole time. The camp had a private beach, boathouse with **canoes, paddle boats**, and games for rainy days. I made many friends and was never bored exploring the shoreline by water each day. 
### A Magical Day on a Private Island
One day, my parents packed a picnic in the motorboat and took my brother and I to a small island in the lake. We spent the afternoon swimming off the large diving rock, working up an appetite. After eating the hot dogs my parents cooked, we explored the island. Sitting on the rocks with our feet in the cool water, tiny sunfish would nibble our toes and make us laugh uncontrollably. Looking back, that perfect summer day created memories I will forever cherish.
### Fun in the Sun (and Water)
The camp had so much to offer during the day. We spent hours swimming, **canoeing**, and using the paddle boats. After exhausting ourselves in the water and sun, we would lay on the private beach to dry off. Those summers created such a carefree atmosphere, where we didn't worry about sunscreen or spending every minute scheduled with activities. We simply enjoyed long days of fun in the sun and water.
### Nightly Fireworks Spectacles  
One of my favorite parts of staying at the camp during early July was watching the nightly fireworks shows over the lake. Even by today's standards, they offered dazzling displays against the dark night sky. My brother and I would lay with our parents on the beach, munching s'mores as the booms and colorful bursts lit up the night. Those fireworks nourished my childhood wonder and are memories I'll always cherish from summers at the lake.
### Lasting Friendships
In addition to making great memories with my family, I also formed friendships during those summers that have lasted my whole life. Many other families would return to the camp year after year. Spending two weeks together in the summer sun created strong bonds. Even today, decades later, a small group of us try to have a reunion each summer at the lake. Those childhood friends remind me of simpler, carefree times growing up at the lakeside camp.
### Return to Nature
Reflecting on those summers now as an adult, I appreciate how the camp created an ideal environment for our young, imaginative selves to connect with nature. We spent each day outdoors, breathing in fresh pine air. Running barefoot on the beach and in the woods nurtured our spirits. Evenings by the fire nurtured our souls. The natural beauty of the forest and lake have stayed with me throughout my life, rooted in those precious summers which helped shape who I am today.
