However, the chase for likes, views and followers can take a mental and even physical toll on users. This article explores some of the darker sides of TikTok addiction and fame.
### The Pandemic Peak  
The COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread isolation as people stayed home to stop the spread of the virus. With in-person social interaction limited, many turned to online platforms like TikTok for entertainment and connection. As a simple yet engaging app, TikTok filled an important social need during this difficult time. Usage skyrocketed as bored people sought short videos to [pass time](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/aguado) and take their minds off the crisis.

### Dopamine Rush of Going Viral
A major draw of TikTok is the potential for one's content to suddenly **blow up**. Receiving thousands or millions of views overnight is exhilarating, triggering brain rewards. Mental health experts note the **"high"** that comes from a viral hit closely mimics **drug addiction**. This dopamine rush drives users to constantly post in hopes of replicating past success. Some take risks to stand out, not realizing the consequences. Unfortunately, the natural human need for praise can be easily exploited through endless scrolling and chasing of arbitrary metrics like likes. Maintaining viral status becomes all-consuming as the bar is raised higher over time.

Consider diversifying your feed with topics promoting **self-reflection, learning or community service** over mindless scrolling. And remember that true fulfillment comes from real world interactions, not arbitrary metrics that pale in significance over time. With willpower and alternative focus, it is possible to graduationally step away from compulsive TikTok habits into a healthier routine.  
### Case Study: The D'Amelio Sisters

Through dance videos, they amassed huge followings that opened career opportunities far beyond the app. However, their reality show also gave a candid look into struggles with **renowned pressures**.
