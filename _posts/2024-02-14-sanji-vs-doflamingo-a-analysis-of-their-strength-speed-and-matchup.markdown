## [Current Sanji would decisively defeat Doflamingo in battle](https://store.fi.io.vn/you-can-never-go-wrong-add-to-stories-a-dog-schnauzer-1) 
Doflamingo was a powerful shichibukai and top executive of the Donquixote Pirates, however Sanji has grown tremendously stronger since their time in Dressrosa. Let's analyze how a rematch between the two would unfold considering Sanji's new feats and abilities.
### **Raid Suit significantly enhances Sanji's physical attributes**
The Raid Suit Sanji received from Judge's research gives him a massive boost that puts him far above Doflamingo. **The Stealth Black technology** allows him to move at lightning speeds that even **One Piece characters with elite reflexes couldn't perceive**. When Sanji fought Queen, the All-Star was utterly unable to see Sanji's movements. This immense speed combined with Sanji's already impressive Haki mastery means Doflamingo wouldn't come close to landing a hit.

### **Ifrit Jambe can overpower top Yonko officers with ease** 
Sanji's strongest technique, Ifrit Jambe, was able to defeat Queen in a single attack after powering it up. Queen is far stronger than Doflamingo as a Yonko commander, yet Sanji dispatched him with little difficulty. Ifrit Jambe's **intense flames hotter than blue fire** would also burn through any strings Doflamingo attempts to use. With one solid blow, Sanji could **decisively end the fight before Doflamingo realizes what hit him**.
### **Advanced armament Haki surpasses Doflamingo's level** 
Haki is the deciding factor in many One Piece fights between top tiers. Sanji has grown leaps and bounds since the timeskip, mastering **Robust Haki techniques like Invisible Shove**. This technique allows him apply force through invisible armor, impacting even logia users internally. Facing such mastery of armament Haki that even bypasses his Devil Fruit weaknesses would leave Doflamingo at a severe disadvantage.
### **New body modifications enhance Sanji's natural gifts**  
Beyond gains in strength, the Raid Suit enhanced aspects of Sanji we've seen before like his resilience and stealth abilities. Modifications like **Exoskeleton Reinforcement** amplified Sanji's toughness far above normal human limits. Even without Haki, direct hits would cause significant damage. Additionally, perks like **Chrome OS** allow new approaches with invisibility and mimicry that catch opponents off guard. Doflamingo lacks a proper counter for these misdirections.
## **In Conclusion: Sanji has definitively surpassed Doflamingo.**
Analysis of Sanji and Doflamingo’s key attributes and recent showings proves Sanji has grown far stronger than when they crossed paths in Dressrosa. The massive amps from his Raid Suit, new mastery of Haki, and greatest technique Ifrit Jambe cement that he could **handily defeat the warlord with little effort**. A rematch would be no contest with Sanji’s thoroughly heightened physical stats, diverse moveset enhancing his natural skills, and greater mastery over all pillars of battle in the New World. He has left elite fighters like Doflamingo in the dust in his rapid development.
