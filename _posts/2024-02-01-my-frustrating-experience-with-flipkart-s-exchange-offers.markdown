### Bait and Switch Tactics
When it comes to exchange offers, Flipkart does not always live up to expectations. They advertise great deals to entice customers but fail to clearly outline the actual terms and conditions. Most customers only find out the full details once the delivery person arrives. 
For example, the offer page may promise an iPhone for a minimal fee after exchanging an old phone. However, in small print it requires the original phone plus all accessories in "perfect working condition". When I tried to exchange my dad's old Nokia, the delivery person demanded the year-old headphones even though the phone was in mint shape otherwise. 
Flipkart also has a tendency to change the goalposts. The confirmation email stated accessories were not needed as long as the phone was in a suitable box. Yet the delivery person acted like a police inspector, insisting on strict adherence to hidden rules. No flexibility is shown even if the customer is otherwise qualified for the exchange.

### Incompetent Customer Service 
When problems inevitably arise, Flipkart's customer service leaves much to be desired. After my exchange was canceled due to the "missing" headphones, I tried contacting support to understand the true policy. However, nobody could provide a clear answer even after 48 hours of waiting. 
As the self-proclaimed leading e-commerce platform in India, one expects prompt resolution of issues from Flipkart. But the lack of communication shows the company is more focused on sales numbers than customer satisfaction. Everyone knows customer service is key to retaining loyal, **long-term customers in the highly competitive retail industry**.
When I finally got through to an agent, they nonchalantly canceled my order without offering a solution. No attempts were made to fix the problem or accommodate the valued customer. It's no surprise trust in the Flipkart brand has taken such a big hit in recent years.
### Dubious Delivery Practices
Stories of Flipkart delivery agents rejecting phones for dubious reasons are all too common. In one example, a delivery person tried to deny an exchange by claiming the phone's screen bent slightly when squeezed tightly. However, this is normal physical behavior for any smartphone exposed to pressure. 
The agent was clearly searching for an excuse to void the exchange, knowing Flipkart would charge a penalty fee for a successful transaction. Their policies clearly state physical damage must be in the form of detatching or cracked screens/body to disqualify a device. This highlights how the incentive structure may be encouraging questionable tactics from the last-mile delivery workforce.
In another instance, a customer's [mint condition OnePlus 3T](https://yt.io.vn/collection/aldama) was rejected on the pretext that it failed to power on. However, Flipkart later admitted the real reason was avoidance of the exchange itself. Such predatory practices betray a lack of transparency and care for their customers.
### Unfair Treatment of Loyal Customers  
The worst part is how Flipkart treats their most loyal, long-term patrons. In one case, a user tried exchanging their 3-year-old flagship OnePlus 3T that remained in "excellent, scratch-less condition" for an iPhone upgrade. 
Rather than value their trusted customer of many years, the delivery agent nitpicked insignificant issues like screen flex to void the deal. Multiple follow-ups yielded no proper response or resolution from Flipkart's executives. They simply canceled the order without accountability.
Long-time clients expect accommodating policies from brands they support financially over time. But Flipkart seems more focused on grabbing one-time sales through misleading offers than nurturing customer relationships. This will only accelerate their declining reputation in the smartphone retail space.
### Bait and Delay Tactics 
When customers do manage to persist past delivery issues, Flipkart engages in delaying tactics to run down the refund period. For instance, after a user's exchange was unfairly rejected, Flipkart claimed the phone was switched off without consent for inspection. 
Numerous follow-ups over multiple weeks eventually led to a refund. However, the drawn-out runaround wasted the customer's time and effort. Clearly, the aim was to stall long enough and hope the user would give up pursuing resolution. 
It has become evident Flipkart views exchange customers as disposable rather than valuable brand promoters. The entire experience feels deliberately designed to bait users with impossible-to-attain deals and then frustrate them into abandoning the process.
### Damage to Brand Trust
While exchange offers seem alluring on the surface, Flipkart's poor handling seriously damages customer confidence. Multiple dissatisfying interactions train users to avoid the company altogether going forward. 
Even formerly loyal patrons now caution friends and followers against the risks. Negative word-of-mouth is Flipkart's own creation through unreliable policies and terrible post-sales support. Unless they reform practices to prioritize fairness and transparency, brand trust may become irreparable over time.
In today's highly connected digital world, unhappy customers swiftly amplify their voices across social networks. Flipkart must learn brand value comes not from one-off exchanges, but long-term relationships with fully satisfied, loyal patrons. Only a customer-centric approach can salvage their deteriorating reputation in the long run.
