### Connecting Locally
To play Minecraft PE locally with another player, both devices need to be connected to the same WiFi network. One player will need to create and host the world. Ensure that the world settings have "Visible to LAN Players" toggled on. 
Once the world is created, the other player can access the "Friends" menu to see the hosted world available to join. Simply tap to join the game. [local area network multiplayer Minecraft PE](https://store.fi.io.vn/dog-breed-schipperke-funny-s-for-dog-lovers348-2) makes it easy for family and friends in the same home to play cooperatively without an internet connection.

### Using a Mobile Hotspot  
If both players have separate WiFi connections but are physically close, one option is for one device to act as a mobile hotspot. The hosting device opens its mobile hotspot, and the other connects to the WiFi hotspot just like any other network. As long as the devices remain in close proximity, **Minecraft PE mobile hotspot multiplayer** allows connecting without being on the same home WiFi router. 
### Playing Across Different Networks
To play Minecraft PE multiplayer across different networks, both players need a Microsoft account signed into their respective devices. Provided each device has an active internet connection, players can join friends' worlds regardless of what WiFi or cellular data network each uses. **Minecraft PE cross network multiplayer** makes it possible to play remotely as long as online connectivity is maintained.
### Setting Xbox Privacy Controls  
Since the Better Together update integrated Minecraft PE with Bedrock Edition on other platforms like Xbox, an Xbox Live account login is now required for online play. It's important to check the privacy and online safety settings associated with one's Xbox profile. If another family member manages account permissions, request they enable access to multiplayer games. Properly configuring **Xbox account privacy settings for Minecraft** ensures a smooth online gaming experience.
### Opening to LAN Play
As the world host, certain steps must be taken to welcome other players. After starting a new world or load an existing one, access the world settings menu. Navigate to the "Multiplayer" tab and toggle the switch next to "Visible to LAN Players" to the ON position. This broadcasts the newly created world on the local network, allowing others on the same WiFi to see and join the game. Mastering the nuances of **Minecraft PE LAN world settings** optimizes the local multiplayer function.  
### Joining a LAN World 
From the main menu, players wanting to join a LAN hosted world select the "Friends" button. This displays a list of all worlds currently hosting on the local network. Locate the desired game and press the "Join" button. The player's avatar will load directly into the mapped world already in progress. For seamless **Minecraft PE LAN joining**, confirm the hosting device's WiFi and world settings are properly configured beforehand.
### Using a Hosted Realm
For persistent online worlds accessible anywhere, Minecraft Realms offers reliable dedicated servers. A monthly or annual subscription unlocks a personal realm that up to ten players can join simultaneously from any internet-connected device. While Realms carries a cost, the tradeoff is a lag-free hosted environment perfect for **Minecraft Realms multiplayer** across great distances without separate network setups.
