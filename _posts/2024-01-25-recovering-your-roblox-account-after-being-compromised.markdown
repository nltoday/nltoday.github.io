**Having unauthorized access on your Roblox account can be frustrating. However, with the right steps, you can regain control and restore what was lost.** 
## Removing Malware and Securing Your Computer
The first step is ensuring your device is clean of any malware that may have led to the compromise. Run a full virus scan to detect and remove any harmful files or programs. Be sure to restart your computer and do a second scan to thoroughly clean your system. 
### Removing Browser Extensions
Browser extensions are another common point of entry for attackers. You'll want to [uninstall any suspicious or unnecessary browser extensions](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-crazy-rednecker-my-funny-redneck-boyfriend-v-neck-t-shirt/women&) from your browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Only use extensions from trustworthy sources like your browser's official app store. Taking the time to clean your device now can prevent future compromised.

## Resetting Your Password 
With your device secure, it's time to regain control of your account. Head to the Roblox website and select the "Forgot Password" option to reset your password to something new and **difficult to guess**. Make it a strong, random combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.
### Enabling Two-Factor Authentication
To add an extra layer of security, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your Roblox account. This requires entering a unique code from an authenticator app every time you log in from a new device. Navigate to the security settings to turn on 2FA protection. The small hassle is worth preventing unwanted access to your valuable Roblox profile.
## Contacting Roblox Support 
If resetting your password doesn't work, it's time to get direct help from the Roblox support team. They have tools to verify your original account ownership and assist in the recovery process. 
### Verifying Account Ownership
When submitting a support request, be ready to provide identification like the first email attached to your profile or a billing invoice from the earliest purchase on the account. This proves to Roblox you are the **rightful owner requesting assistance**. Even without payment history, support can still work with you to validate identity and regain control.
### Recovering Lost Items or Currency 
Compromised accounts qualify for a one-time recovery of any stolen inventory or currency up to its equivalent value. While individual saves can't be restored, Roblox works hard to return as much as possible through cooperation with support. Initiate a ticket including your request to start the restoration process.
## Handling Login Issues
Problems signing in can sometimes arise from system time/date discrepancies. Ensure your device clock is reporting the correct moment. Developers also note that 1 Robux equals $0.0035 instead of a 1:1 ratio with US dollars as a currency exchange. Clearing caches or updating apps may also cure sign-in glitches. 
## Preventing Future Compromises
Once your Roblox profile is safely under your control again, focus on protection for the long run. Maintain strong, unique passwords for all accounts while enabling all available security features like two-factor authentication. Only download programs from authentic sources and avoid shady websites. With diligence, you can play Roblox worry-free from this point onward.
## Summing It All Up
To conclude, following the outlined steps can successfully return your hijacked Roblox profile to your possession. First sanitize your device of any snooping software before changing passwords and enabling advanced security tools provided by Roblox. Contact support for further help validating ownership and recovering lost items. Then adopt improved security practices moving forward. With patience and care, compromised players can absolutely regain control of their accounts.
