## Building a Flat Surface Area
One way to create a Minecraft map that is a solid color is to build a flat 128 x 128 area using a single type of block. This requires gathering a large number of blocks - with a map size of 128 x 128 pixels, you will need 16,384 blocks to cover the entire area. 
Some common blocks that are useful for filling large areas include **dirt, grass blocks, sand, gravel**, or stone. Dirt and grass are readily available in grassy biomes while sand can be gathered easily from deserts or beaches. Stone requires mining but is a durable block available anywhere underground.
When choosing your building area, look for a flat, open space at ground level to avoid terraforming. Areas near spawn are convenient but you may consider using the flat surfaces found in mesas, beaches, or deserts for your large build. Try to keep the area free of trees, flowers or other natural objects that could interfere.
### Clearing and Leveling the Area 
Before starting construction, clear any unwanted blocks or objects from your build site. On Bedrock Edition, shears can quickly remove tall grass and small plants. Use tools like a shovel, axe or your fist to break taller plants, trees and rocks. 
Once cleared, you may need to do some terraforming to level bumpy terrain. [Dirt](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-with-santa-hat-cute-christmas-hat-chihuahua5563-t-shirt) and **grass blocks** are helpful for filling in low spots while stone, logs or slabs can build up high areas. Avoid creating elevation changes within your 128 block build zone.

### Constructing the Base 
Begin laying down your chosen block in straight parallel lines moving outwards from one corner of your build zone. Make sure each row is placed directly against the previous to avoid gaps. 
It may help to designate the boundaries of your build area first using blocks like fences, walls or signs placed every 16 blocks to mark the grid. Check your progress regularly against these boundary markers.
Layers will build up quickly using basic **instant mining tools** like an efficiency V diamond shovel or axe enchanted with **Fortune III**. Be careful not to dig beyond your intended build area. Complete rows and layers before moving to the next.
### Finishing Touches
Once your base layer is complete, double check for any missed spots or gaps in coverage. Go around the perimeter and fill in as needed. Small imperfections will not affect the final map image.
Consider adding decoration around the edges using more of your base block or contrasting blocks. A 2-3 block border looks clean and defined. Signs with helpful messages also don't interfere with the map color.
With your 128x128 flat area fully filled using one block material, you're ready to place a map and capture the solid color image!
## Placing and Using the Map
Now that the hard work of building your solid color base is complete, placing the map itself is simple. You'll need an empty map item and an **item frame** to display it in. 
Item frames can be crafted using **leather** obtained from killing cows. Place the empty frame where you want the map to generate, such as at the center of your build area. 
Right click the empty map into the item frame slot. The map will instantly update to render the area within 128 blocks in all directions. You should now have a completed single color map!
### bold**Mapping Tips**
- Maps placed in item frames update even when out of render distance, no need to stay close.
- Maps can be removed from item frames and taken anywhere for future use without re-generating the image. 
- **Maps of unique solid colors** are useful for testing infinity rooms, void spawn points, or single pallette builds in creative mode. 
- Try combining maps of different colors to create mosaic or pixel art patterns when building. Place maps edge to edge for seamless multi-color surfaces.
With your new custom color map in hand, you're free to continue building and designing! Experiment with different blocks and map combinations. Building the 128x128 area takes effort but allows complete control over your map's appearance. Get creative!
## Alternative Methods
If the thought of clearing a 128x128 area is too daunting a task, there are a couple alternatives that may provide simple pre-built solid color maps:
### Dark Void Maps from The End
Venture through an End portal to The End dimension. Carefully bridge out 129 blocks in one direction and use **elytra** or **cloud-in-a-bottle** to fly up and place an empty map. 
The resulting map image will cover the dark purple void that makes up much of The End. While somewhat dull, this provides an effortless solid color map without any building required.
### Ocean Maps
Many **ocean** biomes span for hundreds of blocks uninterrupted. Equip **water breathing** gear and swim or boat out past 128 blocks then place an empty map. 
This method gives a simple blue solid color map showcasing the ocean floor. The color may not be as vibrant as building your own custom palette but is low effort.
### Nether Waste Maps 
Similar to the ocean tactic, venture into the **nether** and place a map past 128 blocks from spawn in a wasteland area comprised of netherrack and lava seas. 
The resulting map will fill in a primarily solid reddish-orange from the dominant nether blocks. Not very exciting visually but easy to obtain.
While these alternative dimension maps require no building, they have limited color choices. For complete creative control, constructing your own flat building site using specific blocks remains the best way to design custom single color maps.
Consider experimenting with different methods to find what works best for your building goals and play style. Combine multiple solid color maps creatively to make interesting patterns too. Getting started is as simple as gathering your building materials and finding a suitable space.
