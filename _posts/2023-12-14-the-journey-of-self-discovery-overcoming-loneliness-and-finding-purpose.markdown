### Feeling Adrift in a New City  
As a 28-year-old [management graduate](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/ahlstrom) from one of India's oldest institutes, I had moved to Mumbai in pursuit of a high-paying career. While earning upwards of 50 lakhs per annum seemed like **the dream for many**, I felt more like a slave to money. Away from friends and family in Kolkata, the loneliness of living alone in a rented flat slowly took its toll. After long work hours, I had no social life to look forward to.

### Battling Depression in Isolation
The initial years were especially difficult as I sank into a deep depression. **None of the people around me seemed to care** about how I was struggling internally. I put on a brave front by faking smiles but the emotional pain refused to subside. Not being able to connect well with parents added to my loneliness. The low birthday wishes one year brought home the harsh reality that most had forgotten me in their lives.
### Seeking Connections and Finding Heartbreak 
To cope with loneliness, I turned to dating apps in search of companionship. A 6-month live-in relationship gave temporary relief but ended bitterly. A prior 2-year serious relationship also fell apart as my then-girlfriend felt I had become **"too dull"**. Rejections only amplified my feelings of loneliness and failure. I started believing that **others truly care only if you become successful.**  
### Withdrawing into Isolation  
Disillusioned with relationships and society, I chose a life of solitary living. The **filtered virtual world** I saw on social media offered little solace—instead adding to my pain. I stopped using platforms that showed others finding love and starting families—realities I seemed distant from. The only connection remained through occasional writing on Quora, where at least I could anonymously share emotions.
### Hitting Rock Bottom
Life seemed stagnant with no signs of improvement. I was convinced happiness would forever remain elusive. Each new day brought fresh struggles as I fought recurring thoughts of giving up. However, some small voice within still pushed me to try bettering myself despite countless failures. Finding even a few empathetic listeners on Quora who texted kind words became a ray of hope during dark times.
### Rediscovering Hope and Purpose
With time, I gained a new perspective—that every life has regrets, and it's never too late to course-correct. Taking care of myself both physically and emotionally became priorities. Instead of wallowing in self-pity, I focused energies on nurturing skills and talents. Gradually, the isolation and loneliness eased as everyday challenges felt surmountable. Today, I have faith in my ability to overcome any obstacles through perseverance. My journey continues, but with a renewed sense of purpose and lightness of spirit.
### Beyond Success: Finding Fulfillment  
While a high-paying career and financial stability are goals many aspire for, they don't guarantee inner peace or purpose. Realizing this taught me to seek fulfillment from within instead of external factors like relationships, societal approval or material wealth that are beyond our control. Each small act of self-care and personal growth has become an end in itself. And if this story helps even one other soul, it would make the struggles worthwhile. Life presents us opportunities every day - it's up to us whether we choose to see the glass as half-empty or half-full.
