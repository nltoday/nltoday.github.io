### Access to timely care
John recently had an accident while on vacation in the UK. After tripping on an uneven paving stone and knocking himself out, he was swiftly taken to the hospital by ambulance. At the large London hospital, he was seen within 10 minutes of arriving and received X-rays, an ECG, stitches, and other medical attention. The total cost to him was zero due to the UK's universal healthcare system. 
In contrast, Steve recalled a time in the US where he put off seeing a doctor due to the high costs. With a $7,650 deductible on his insurance plan, he knew he would have to pay the full amount before any coverage kicked in. It wasn't until his mysterious symptoms worsened that he finally went to an urgent care clinic, where he learned he had developed an infection. By then it was more difficult and costly to treat. **"Lack of access to timely primary care"** due to financial barriers had negatively impacted his health outcome and experience.

### Quality and costs of care 
While some argue private insurance provides better quality care, international rankings tell a different story. The UK ranks #7 globally for healthcare outcomes while the US is at #37. Spain, where John now lives, is also highly ranked at #7. Despite paying only €2,408 total out-of-pocket in Spain in 2018, John feels the standard of care is much higher than what he received in Texas with costs of $30,000. The preventative focus of countries with universal systems may better support overall population health. 
For Steve and his family in Canada, they pay $9,000 annually in taxes but have **"zero out-of-pocket costs"** for all their medical needs, from routine checkups to surgery or hospitalization. Knowing they have guaranteed access to any doctor or facility without worry of huge bills provides immense peace of mind. They see it as a small price to pay to protect their health and finances.
### Equity and non-discrimination
While the US system is discriminatory, denying some people care based on factors like income, gender or pre-existing conditions, universal healthcare is based on the principle of equitable access for all. In Canada, Steve likes that anyone can receive the same high quality treatment regardless of their socioeconomic status, race, beliefs, or other attributes. No one is denied or charged more due to personal characteristics. 
This level of **"non-discriminatory access to healthcare"** provides reassurance that if someone falls on hard times financially or becomes critically ill, they won't lose their ability to get the treatment they need. Everyone contributes and benefits as members of the same community. Such social solidarity strengthens the fabric of society.
### Choice, flexibility and innovation  
With universal systems, some argue there may be less choice in doctors or longer wait times. However, John's experience in Spain and Steve's in Canada show this is not necessarily the case. Both families can see any specialist they like without delay. While certain elective procedures may have waitlists, emergency or important care is always prioritized. 
Innovation also continues to thrive in countries with universal coverage. With the entire population assured access to the latest medical advances, this drives pharmaceutical companies and research institutions to develop new cures and technologies. Rather than access being limited to those who can afford it, all citizens can benefit from breakthroughs.
### Financial well-being and reduced stress
While the US health insurance and hospital bills drained Steve's savings, universal coverage has provided financial security and less stress over potential future health costs. Not only do he and his wife pay less taxes overall than premiums, deductibles and copays they faced previously, but they never need to worry about medical bills derailing their finances or retirement plans. Knowing their healthcare is basically pre-paid through taxes removes that constant anxiety.
For John, the move to Spain's universal system has lifted a huge burden. Instead of up to $30,000 annually out of pocket, a maximum of only €2,408 provides much-needed financial relief and predictability. He doesn't dread getting sick or injured due to the crushing costs. Both families agree that healthcare is too crucial to handle through for-profit models that put people's well-being at risk for the sake of profits.
### Conclusion 
After experiencing both universal healthcare and the American private insurance system, it is clear to John and Steve which approach they prefer. While not perfect, countries with universal coverage deliver timely access to high quality care based on need rather than ability to pay. They ensure equitable, non-discriminatory treatment for all as members of the same community. Costs to individuals and society are lower through risk-pooling while also improving general population health. Financial security, reduced stress and just basic human dignity are better upheld. Overall, universal healthcare provides greater peace of mind that one's health and welfare will be cared for.
