### The Popularity Standings
Football has long been established as the number one sport in England in terms of popularity and viewership. It surpassed cricket sometime in the late 19th century as England rapidly industrialized and the working classes embraced football as their primary sport. 
Today, a survey would undoubtedly show football at the top of the sport popularity chart, with millions of fans attending games weekly in the English Premier League and consistently high TV viewership for matches. Cricket meanwhile, holds a strong [traditionally prestigious national sport](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/alkire) status but lags behind in attendance and viewership numbers compared to football. 
The debate on the second and third most popular sports often sees cricket and rugby fighting for that spot. Exact numbers are hard to decipher but both sports can make credible claims, depending on the metrics used.

### Class Divide and Time Commitment Factors
One major factor historically separating cricket and football popularity was the class divide, with **upper-middle class cricket** associated more with the elites and nobility, while football took root among the working classes in Northern England from the late 1800s onward. 
As the population demographics shifted toward a larger working class, football's support base grew substantially more than cricket's. Additionally, the **time commitment required** for cricket matches, from weekend club games to 5-day international Tests, limits its mass appeal compared to soccer's compact 90-minute format.
### School Exposure and Grounds Attendance 
Another weakness for cricket has been less emphasis on the sport in school physical education curriculums compared to football in recent decades. This denies the sport opportunities to capture new young fans the way soccer continues to do.
However, cricket often draws impressive crowds when it hosts big international matches, like **One Day Internationals** and Twenty20 games that bring colorful packed stadium audiences. Attendance at traditional Lord's and The Oval Test matches also indicates the sport retains passionate followers.
### World Cup Bumps and Ashes Rallies
Major global tournaments provide a bump to cricket's popularity, none more so than the ICC Cricket World Cup held in England in 2019. Huge crowds turned out and captured the public's imagination, showing cricket's potential **mass appeal** given the right format and event. 
The most galvanizing cricket event for English fans remains the biennial Ashes series against arch-rivals Australia. After winning the 2005 Ashes, the victorious English cricketers enjoyed an **open-top bus victory parade** through London rivaling team celebrations after big football triumphs.
### EDITED: Resurgent Interest is Still There
In a June 2019 edit to the initial content, the writer notes the huge crowds that turned up for Cricket World Cup matches, disproving any notion that interest in the sport has declined precipitously. While football may hold on to the top ranking, there is clearly still **significant ongoing interest** for quality cricket when the opportunity presents itself.
This Edit acknowledges cricket retains **grassroots popularity** to motivate large live audiences for marquee events and series like the Ashes, counterbalancing perceptions of it following only a niche upper-class audience in modern England. When presented right, cricket attracts mainstream interest on par with football.
### Conclusion: Ebbs and Flows in the Balance
In summary, while football sit clearly atop England's sport popularity mountain based on regular attendance and viewership metrics, cricket's place fluctuates in that number two spot with rugby. Both have credible cases depending in the measuring stick. 
But what is certain is that interest in cricket far from dead or negligible - it bubbles below the surface ready to match football in fervor during key moments. The balance between the two great sports of England experiences ongoing ebb and flows that will keep their popularity positions in long-term debate.
