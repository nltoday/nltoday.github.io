### Primary Education in India
Primary education in India typically includes grades 1 through 5 for children aged 6 to 11 years old. During this stage, students learn foundational concepts in subjects like math, science, social studies and languages. The curriculum is designed to develop basic literacy and numeracy skills. Assessment is generally done through class exams and assignments rather than formal board exams. Students are promoted to the next grade based on their continuous evaluation and performance throughout the year.

### Secondary Education and Board Exams 
Secondary education in India spans grades 6 through 10 for students aged 12 to 17 years old. This stage builds on concepts taught in primary school and introduces more advanced topics. Students typically study core subjects like English, maths, science, social science and elective subjects. Formal board exams are conducted at the end of 10th grade by state boards like the CBSE and ICSE. These board exams carry significant weightage as they determine admission to higher secondary or pre-university programs.
### CBSE Board Grading System
The Central Board of Secondary Education or CBSE is one of the largest education boards in India. It uses a [letter grade system](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/dog-mom) to evaluate 10th grade board exam performance. The top grade is an A1 for "Outstanding" performance above 90%, followed by A2 for scores between 80-90%. Grades B1, B2, C1, C2, D and E indicate progressively lower achievement levels down to 33%. This grading method provides a clear overview of a student's strengths and areas for improvement.
### Higher Secondary Education  
After passing 10th grade, students enter higher secondary or pre-university programs spanning grades 11-12. Popular course options include science, commerce and humanities streams. State education boards like CBSE and ICSE continue to assess students through board exams at the end of 12th grade. Performance in these exams plays a key role in university admissions. Many institutes use a **Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)** on a scale of 0-10 to evaluate students holistically based on all years of higher secondary education.
### Indian University Grading Systems
Most Indian universities follow either the American GPA system or an internal grading scale to assess undergraduate and postgraduate students. The tier 1 National Institutes of Technology use a **10-point CGPA scale** where above 9 is equivalent to straight A's. Other top central universities commonly employ a **7-point grading scale** where S is the highest grade. Some state universities still use a traditional **divisional system** to place students in the 1st, 2nd or 3rd division based on aggregate marks. Most programs also award letter grades to provide a more detailed analysis of performance in individual courses or subjects.
### Divisional Grading in Schools
Currently, some schools in India continue to use the traditional divisional grading method for annual assessments. Under this system, students scoring **above 75% aggregate** are placed in the 1st division indicating outstanding achievement. The 2nd division denotes scores between 60-74% reflecting good performance. Scores between 50-59% earn a student a place in the 3rd division, demonstrating average academic ability. This divisional grading gives a consolidated overview of a child's performance throughout the year. However, it lacks transparency on strengths and shortcomings in specific subjects.  
### Transition to Uniform Grading Standards
Over time, more schools and boards are transitioning to **criterion-referenced grading** using detailed matrices. This involves evaluating students against well-defined learning standards or outcomes rather than comparing them against each other. It aims to assess what each child has truly learned rather than just their relative ranking. There are ongoing discussions about introducing uniform grading standards across boards in India to facilitate fair assessment and mobility between different education systems. A common scorecard would make performance more meaningful and help benchmark success at local and global levels.
