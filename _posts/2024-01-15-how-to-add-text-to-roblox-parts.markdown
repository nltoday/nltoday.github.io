## Understanding the Basics
Adding text to parts in Roblox is a simple process. The key is using a SurfaceGUI or ScreenGUI and placing a TextLabel inside. 
SurfaceGUIs are placed directly on a part and will move and rotate with that part. ScreenGUIs appear on the player's screen instead of being attached to a specific part. 
To get started, select the part you want to add text to in the Explorer pane. Click the plus sign next to it and choose "SurfaceGUI" or "ScreenGUI". Then click the plus sign within the new GUI and select "TextLabel".
### Configuring the TextLabel 
The TextLabel component has several important properties for adding and styling text:
[Text](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-riding-moon-bike-halloween-lunar-cycling) - Contains the actual text string being displayed. 
**TextSize** - Sets the font size in pixels. 
**TextScaled** - Scales the text to fit the TextLabel size if checked. Useful for dynamic text.
**Background Transparency** - Makes the background more or less transparent from 0 to 1.
**Position** - Sets the TextLabel's position relative to its parent part or screen.
These basics allow you to add simple static or dynamic text anywhere in your Roblox experience.

## Advanced TextLabel Options
Beyond the core properties, TextLabels provide extra features for **customizing text appearance and behavior**.
### Font Settings
The font family, style, and outline options allow precise control over typography. Popular font families like "Code" are available by default.
### Text Wrapping 
Enabling text wrapping makes the label resize and break text into multiple lines. Combined with scaling, this creates resizable text blocks.
### Text Colors 
Different text and outline colors can improve readability or indicate status. Examples include error messages in red or notifications highlighted in yellow. 
### Text Anchored Position
Instead of positioning from the upper-left corner, anchoring aligns text within the TextLabel bounds using presets like center or right.
## Scripting Text Interactions
For **dynamic or interactive text elements**, scripting offers robust possibilities. Common uses include:
### Updating Text Values
Scripts can read and change the Text property in response to game events, timers, or player input. Displaying scores, stats, or messages this way.
### Styling Text Dynamically 
Things like text color or transparency can change programmatically based on conditions to emphasize information. 
### Responding to Text Clicks
Detecting when the TextLabel is clicked allows links, buttons, or other interactivity through script callbacks.
## Taking Text to the Next Level
Roblox's text system provides a solid foundation, but experienced developers regularly **push creative boundaries** with inventive uses:
### Advanced Text Effects 
Techniques like custom shaders simulate realistic materials like glass, metal, or neon lighting behind text. 
### Scene Text Integration
Embedding text directly into 3D environments using specialized parts, models and scripting makes signs feel truly placed.
### Text-Based Games
Some developers create fully text-driven interactive fiction or dialogue tree experiences entirely within the toolbox.
So in summary, Roblox's built-in text handling allows you to enhance any project with informative, stylish or reactive words - and experienced scripters take it even further! Let me know if any part needs more explanation.
