## A Brief History of Retro Consoles
When the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was released in 1983, it began a revolution in home video gaming. Prior to the NES, the video game industry had crashed following a boom of low-quality games and oversaturation in the market. However, with the NES, Nintendo helped revitalize the industry by adopting a licensing model that allowed third-party developers to publish quality games for the system. This helped ensure a steady stream of popular titles. 
Some of the most beloved games in history were released on the NES, including **Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda,[ and ](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/alcott)Metroid.** These games established long-running franchises that remain popular to this day. Throughout the 1990s, successors like the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and Nintendo 64 continued advancing graphics and gameplay. Meanwhile, competitors like Sega rose to prominence with the Genesis console.
## Choosing an Emulator
