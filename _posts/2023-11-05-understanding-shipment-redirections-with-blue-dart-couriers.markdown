## Tracking Shipments With Waybill Numbers 
Tracking shipments is crucial for both senders and recipients. Blue Dart uses an **eleven-digit numeric waybill number** to offer visibility and traceability during transit. This unique code assigns to each shipment moves through Blue Dart's network. Customers rely on waybill numbers to check status updates online in real-time. 
### How Waybill Numbers Guide Shipments
All courier movement relies on accurate address information, especially the pincode. The waybill number ties directly to the destination pincode provided. If this pincode is incorrect, it can lead to redirection. Blue Dart routes shipments based solely on the pincode assigned to the waybill number. Upon arrival, addresses are verified. Any mismatch between address and pincode triggers redirection to the proper location.

## Common Reasons For Redirections
### Incorrect Pincode Origination 
The most frequent cause of redirection stems from the sender providing the wrong pincode. With Blue Dart directing all movement by pincode, an inaccurate one results in the shipment going to the wrong place initially. Only upon discovering the address discrepancy does redirection occur.
### Recipient Relocation 
Sometimes the consignee moves to a new address before the shipment arrives. Redirection responds to ensure timely delivery. The recipient may update their new location directly with Blue Dart using the existing waybill number. 
### Dual Address Handling
Large companies often require goods sent to both permanent headquarters and temporary office locations. Blue Dart facilitates this through redirection under the same waybill number per customer request. Either address can receive and redirect internally as needed.
## Customer-Initiated Redirections
### Sender Requests
Senders themselves may wish to change the delivery address after dispatch. Blue Dart accommodates such redirection requests so long as the waybill number stays the same for tracking. 
### Consignee Redirection
On rare occasions, the recipient is unavailable at the delivery address and requests redirection to an alternative approved by them. Blue Dart uses the waybill number to shift the shipment accordingly.
## Redirected Shipment Status Updates
All redirection actions undertaken by Blue Dart update dynamically in the system. Customers tracking shipments via the waybill number on the Blue Dart website witness status changes in real-time. This enables full transparency of redirection details without needing direct communication each time. 
# Redirection Fees Compared to Competition  
## Blue Dart's Complimentary Redirections
Among major Indian couriers, Blue Dart stands alone in offering one free redirection per consignment as a service to customers. Whether due to incorrect pincodes or post-dispatch address changes, the first redirection faces no additional cost. This addresses common errors without penalty.
### Competitors Charge Redistribution Fees
Other courier services charge redirection fees, sometimes substantial depending on distance. Such charges potentially discourage corrections or flexibility. Blue Dart aims to ease the burden through **complimentary first-time redirections** on domestic shipments.
## Fee-Based Continued Redirections 
While covering initial redirection costs, Blue Dart does levy fees on multiple or complex redirections. Too many address alterations fall outside standard delivery scope. The charges act as a deterrent against frivolous or unplanned diversions straining resources. Customers plan shipments carefully to utilize the single free redirection.
# Streamlined Redirection Process  
## Initiation Through Customer Care 
To enact a redirection, customers contact Blue Dartâ€™s customer care representatives by phone or email. Details provided include the waybill number, current location, revised destination, and reason for change. Representatives validate authenticity before approving redirection in the system.
### Minimal Redirection Timelines
With standard pre-approved redirections, Blue Dart aims to redirect shipments within 24 hours after receiving customer instructions. More complex cases involving inter-city movements may take up to 48 hours depending on transit arrangements required. Representatives provide timeline estimations upon accepting each redirection request.
## Redirection Status Tracking
As with the original consignment, customers continue tracking redirected shipments online through the original waybill number. Dynamic status updates reveal each stage of redirection including pickup, transit, and anticipated delivery to the revised address. This real-time visibility maintains continuity of service.
# Exceptions to Redirection Policies
## Special Circumstances Considered Case-By-Case 
While standard domestic redirections face little restriction, special cases arising due to external factors require individual assessment. Natural disasters, infrastructure disruptions or security situations could delay or restrict redirection approval or timelines. 
### International Redirections Have Varied Policies
Cross-border shipments generally face increased complexity for redirection due to customs clearances involved. Blue Dart reviews international redirection requests considering origin/destination country regulations which may limit eligibility or levy additional costs. 
Customers can contact customer care to discuss potential redirection of shipments in non-standard circumstances. Blue Dart aims for flexibility within regulatory/safety boundaries to resolve shipment issues to customer satisfaction to the best of its ability.
