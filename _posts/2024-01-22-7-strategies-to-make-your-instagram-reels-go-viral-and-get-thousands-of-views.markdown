### Use Trending Sounds and Hashtags
Adding trending sounds and hashtags to your Instagram Reels is a great way to boost visibility and increase views and engagement. When you use popular audios that people are already searching for and engaging with, it makes your Reel more likely to be discovered. Hashtags can also help you reach a wider audience outside your existing followers. Try including [trending audio tracks](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-4th-of-july-merica-men-women-american-flag-gifts-chihuahua-dog) and **relevant hashtags** targeting your niche in each Reel you create.

### Incorporate Engaging Video Content  
Focus on creating unique, funny, relatable or entertaining video content that grabs people's attention in the first few seconds. Things like how-to tutorials, funny reactions, lifestyle moments, and entertaining challenges often perform very well. Experiment with different types of content to see what resonates best with your followers. Make sure each Reel tells a clear story and has a **memorable concept** to keep viewers watching till the end.
### Post at Optimal Times
Just like with any other type of social media content, the timing of your posts can significantly impact viewership. Pay attention to when your followers are most active and engage with other accounts. Most creators find success posting their Reels during lunch breaks, evenings or weekends. Test out different times and days to see when your audience is most receptive. Consistently posting your Reels at the **right times** each week can help boost views over time.
### Engage with Followers and Comments  
User generated content and interactions are very important for the success of Reels. Make it a point to consistently engage with your followers by replying to their comments, starting relevant conversations in comment threads, and encouraging them to share feedback. You can even turn comment questions into new reel ideas. This high level of engagement and **two-way interactions** signals to the Instagram algorithm that your content is worth recommending to new viewers.
### Leverage Other Social Networks  
Don't just share your Reels to Instagram. Get more eyes on your videos by cross-promoting them on other platforms like Twitter, YouTube, TikTok and Facebook. Tailor each post to the specific platform by using trending hashtags, captions etc relevant to that network. Let your existing followers on other networks know to check out your Instagram profile for bonus content. Getting new visitors from other sources can expose your Reels to a completely fresh **pool of potential viewers.**   
### Collaborate with Influencers
One of the fastest ways to significantly increase views is by collaborating or feature requests with accounts that have bigger followings than you in similar niches. Reach out to micro-influencers or creators you've found value in their content previously. Propose a creative concept you both can be a part of. Don't forget to properly tag the collaborator/s in the Reels and in your captions. These cross-promotional efforts allow you to leverage their fanbase and get introduced to new potential followers through their shares.
### Consider Using Instagram Reels Ads
If organic views stagnate after consistent posting over weeks, it may be time to promote your high-performing Reels further with low-cost Instagram ads. Ads allow you to selectively target relevant audiences based on locations, interests, behaviors and demographics to get your video in front of people most likely to engage. Test promoting Reels with tight ad budgets of $5-10/day for 1-2 weeks to see what performs best before increasing investments. Leverage ads for **accelerated viewer growth** when tactics like hashtags, times, and collaborations have been fully optimized organically first.
In conclusion, these proven strategies like using trending audio and hashtags, engaging video storytelling, optimal posting times, user interactions in comments, cross-promoting on multiple social channels, connecting with influencers for collaborations and leveraging low-cost Instagram ads when timed right can significantly boost your weekly Reels views into the thousands with consistent effort. The key is experimenting to find what resonates best for your unique audience.
