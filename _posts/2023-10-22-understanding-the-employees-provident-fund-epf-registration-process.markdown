### Getting Registered with EPFO
To begin the EPF registration process, employers must first register on the official website of the Employees' Provident Fund Organization (EPFO). The EPFO portal allows employers to conveniently apply for EPF registration online. Upon submitting the required details, documents and information, the registration process is initiated. 
Within a few working days, the employer will receive login credentials via email to access their EPFO employer account. This marks the completion of the initial registration step. Employers can then proceed with the subsequent EPF registration procedures through their EPFO employer dashboard.

### Applying for UAN Scheme Enrollment  
With the employer registration complete, the next step is to enroll in the Universal Account Number (UAN) scheme run by EPFO. The UAN scheme allows portability of EPF accounts by allotting a unique member ID to each employee.
To apply for UAN scheme enrollment, employers need to provide key details like business PAN, GST registration, address proof, authorized signatory information and more. On approval of the application, EPFO assigns a unique [establishment code](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/alfieri) to identify the employer. 
This establishment code acts as a primary identifier linking the employer EPF account to employee UAN accounts. It is mandatory to have a valid establishment code to complete the EPF registration process.
### Uploading Employee Details for UAN Generation
Once enrolled in the UAN scheme, employers can start uploading employee master details using the establishment code. Information submitted usually includes name, gender, date of birth, bank account details and more.
EPFO generates a unique 11-digit UAN number for each employee upon verification of submitted details. Employers can then link the UAN to the employee PF master data. This associates the UAN with the establishment code to activate EPF services for that employee.
### Applying for EPF Code Number
To finally complete the EPF registration, employers need to obtain an EPF code number. They can apply for an EPF code through the EPFO portal by providing required details in the application form. 
On approval, EPFO issues a unique 8-digit EPF code starting with the region code. This EPF code works as the main identifier for the employer EPF account. It allows employers to carry out various EPF-related activities and operations through their EPFO dashboards.
### Filing Monthly ECRs and Paying Contributions
With a valid EPF code in place, employers can now start filing Electronic Challan-cum-Return (ECR) on a monthly basis. The ECR is used to record employee-wise EPF contribution details like names, UAN numbers, wages, contribution amounts and more.
Employers need to generate the ECR, verify details, make the contribution payment and submit the challan by the due date specified by EPFO each month. Timely filing of monthly ECRs and payment of contributions completes the recurring EPF compliance process post registration.

### Resolving Registration and Compliance Issues
Despite following the steps diligently, employers may face certain issues during or after the EPF registration process. EPFO has mechanisms in place to resolve such problems.
Common registration or compliance related queries like correction in establishment data, employee details, contribution amounts, late fee waiver requests and more can be raised through the grievance redressal module. 
Employers need to fill the online complaint form providing all relevant information. EPFO officials will review the request and take necessary corrective actions. For urgent matters, live chat or call center support is also available.
In some cases where documents are required for verification, employers may need to courier the papers to the concerned EPFO office. Regional PF offices also conduct periodic employer interactions and workshops to address compliance problems.
