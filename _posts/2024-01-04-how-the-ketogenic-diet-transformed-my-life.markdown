I'm going share my keto journey and how it has helped improve my overall health and wellbeing. When I first learned about the ketogenic way of eating, I was skeptical like many others as I followed a strict vegan diet for years. But an unexpected turn of events led me to give keto a try and the results have been life-changing. Keep reading to learn my story and the many benefits I've experienced from adopting a ketogenic lifestyle.  
### Discovering I Had Hidden Health Issues
While I felt healthy as a vegan, I was often tired and struggled with digestive issues like GERD. After having my first child, some blood tests revealed I was prediabetic and at risk for insulin resistance. This concerned my doctor husband and led him to analyze my daily diet of agave, soy, gluten-free pasta, and bananasâ€”all high in carbs and sugar. I was on a path towards full-blown diabetes but didn't want to change.

### An Accidental Ketogenic Experiment 
A few months later, my family got snowed in with a friend who followed a strict **ketogenic high-fat low-carb diet**. With no other food available, I reluctantly ate things I normally avoided like salmon, eggs, bacon, cheese, and heavy cream. To my surprise, I felt satisfied instead of hungry between meals. When we got home, I had lost weight and fit into smaller pants without even trying. Intrigued by the results, we fully adopted a keto lifestyle.
### Discovering the Many Benefits of Keto
Going keto solved my digestive issues and I no longer felt tired or inflamed. My skin cleared up, I had more energy, and my blood tests showed my thyroid and insulin levels were now normal. Best of all, I dropped the weight without extra exercise. The positive changes motivated me to stick with keto long-term and reap even more rewards for my health and wellness.
### Finding Freedom from Food Addiction  
For years, I struggled with binge eating and an unhealthy relationship with food. No diet ever helped me gain control until keto. Eliminating carbs and sugars curbed my cravings and mental obsession with eating. Now I eat nutritious fats and lots of vegetables without feeling restricted. Keto has given me a normal relationship with food for the first time.
### Improving Fertility and Overall Wellness
Going keto also boosted my fertility. I became pregnant twice without issue while on birth control, something that was previously difficult. Adopting a ketogenic lifestyle also eliminated any muscle pain or tension in my back/neck. My energy levels stabilized and mental clarity improved drastically. Now I feel calm, focused and energized all day without crashes.
### Maintaining a Flexible Ketogenic Approach
While I still follow a low-carb diet, I've relaxed my rules over time for an occasional treat. As long as I keep net carbs under 20g daily, I can enjoy the occasional mango lassi or crisps in moderation. Overall, the ketogenic way of eating has become a lifestyle I feel great on long-term. I'm passionate about sharing my story and experience to help others discover the life-changing benefits of a keto diet too.
