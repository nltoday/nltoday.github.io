No job opportunities were visible for the husband in his birth chart according to the initial astrologer's reading. However, a second analysis of both charts provided a more nuanced outlook.

The astrologer noted [Meen lagna](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-matching-outfits-for-holiday-chinchilla-christmas-tree-1) and **Meen rashi** placements indicated Pisces ascendant and moon sign. With **Shani**, the lord of karma, in the enemy sign of **Aquarius** in the 10th house of career, and being **retrograde**,**aspecting** the ascendant from the 6th house, government opportunities did not seem favorable currently. However, **Budh Shukra**'s placements offered alternative possibilities.
### Potential Private Sector Roles  
Under the current **Budh Shani** period until October 2022, direct government roles may remain difficult to secure. But **Shukra**'s aspect on the 10th house from Libra in the 4th created opportunities in **private administrative or customer service fields**. Carefully navigating competition could lead to **stable positions in government-affiliated organizations**.

## The Wife's Chart Provides Insight
Seeking a second reading incorporating the wife's chart offered new insights. Certain placements in her chart appeared to balance challenges in his professional journey. 
### Indications of Support During Struggles
The additional astrologer noticed factors that **could ease financial or mental stress** during career setbacks. For example, **Yoga karma** connecting the relationship houses suggested she **might provide emotional or financial assistance** when needed.

Interestingly, **Venus** was well-positioned in the wife's chart to positively **influence professional matters through connection and diplomacy**. And **Jupiter** blessed both charts, promising broader opportunities would arise through perseverance and relying on each other's strengths.
## Patience and Planning Will Lead to Fulfillment
In conclusion, while immediate government roles seemed unlikely, the joint analysis indicated promising prospects by carefully managing the present **Budh Shani** influences. With the wife's support balancing challenges, continuing efforts to improve qualifications and leveraging social networks, the native could expect to secure a stable career path aligned with his talents in the **energy, administrative or training sectors** within 1-2 years.
