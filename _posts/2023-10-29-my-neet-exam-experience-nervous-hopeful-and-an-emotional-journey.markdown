Preparing for such an important exam like NEET is surely an arduous task. But going through the exam day itself comes with its own set of anxieties, hopes and overall emotions. Here is my recap of the NEET 2022 exam day that I had gone through - an experience full of nerves, hopes and emotions in the end. 
### Waking up with Anxiety
It was around midnight when I decided to close all my prep and go to bed. However, thoughts of the exam kept me awake till around 2:30am. On the D-day morning, I woke up at 8:30am with anxiety taking over me. My mind compelled me to take a quick 30-minute **last-minute review** of two important chapters despite planning not to study anymore.

### Relieving Stress through Exercise   
Seeing my restlessness, I decided to relieve my tension through some light physical activity. I went for a around 45-minute run while [pumping music](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-autumn-fall-pumpkin-truck-mappe-thanksgiving324-chihuahua-dog) helped calm my nerves. Though my calves were sore later, it was worth it to get into a better state of mind.
### Reaching the Exam Centre
I left for the exam centre around 11:45am which was about 5km away. Reaching there by 12:30pm, I got some fresh air in the trees around before entering the premises at 1:00pm. Seeing other tensed students made me a bit confident that I would fare well this time. 
### Attempting different sections calmly
I attempted different sections one by one without feeling pressured about time. By around 5:05pm, I finished attempting all questions including some last-minute revisions. With some questions left unanswered intentionally, I submitted my paper feeling relieved yet anxious about the result.
### Calculating Initial Score and Emotions
That evening, I calculated my initial score from some answer keys to be around 652 marks. Seeing my happy parents lifted my spirit. Further checking with two popular answer keys next day, I found my score to be 667 - giving me hope that I may get a seat in a good medical college.
### Waiting for Results and Improving Skills
Now all I could do was patiently wait for the official results while utilizing this period to hone other skills like **writing abilities**. No matter the results, this experience has been one full of learnings for handling exam pressures better in the future.
### Rethinking Sleep and Travel Plan     
Looking back, I realized sleeping just 4 hours instead of the ideal 6-7 hours due to last minute revisions and early morning disturbances affected me adversely. In future, I will carefully plan my travel to avoid getting stuck in traffic jams which adds to stress. Overall, it was an emotionally draining yet fruitful journey.
### Signing Off with Gratitude 
I am thankful to all who supported me through this important phase of my life. Whether I get selected or not, I will keep working hard with positivity. This experience has taught me valuable life lessons to remain calm under pressure and make most of every situation. Wishing the very best to all future aspirants!
