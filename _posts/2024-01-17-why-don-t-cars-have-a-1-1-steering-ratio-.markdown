### Steering Effort and Driver Comfort
The main reason cars don't have a 1:1 steering ratio is to reduce steering efforts for drivers and improve comfort. With a direct 1:1 ratio, even slight turns of the steering wheel would sharply change the vehicle's direction, requiring great strength and focus from the driver. **Larger steering ratios allow drivers to turn the wheel multiple times to execute turns while maintaining a comfortable grip and casual riding experience.**   
For heavier vehicles like large SUVs and trucks, the steering forces needed to turn the wheels becomes substantial. Ratios of 21:1 to 24:1 are common, letting drivers smoothly steer with moderate effort. This ensures safety and comfort on roads which may include bumps or potholes that could disturb direct 1:1 control.

### Handling Light Vehicles
Smaller cars could potentially utilize a closer 1:1 ratio since less force is required to turn the wheels. However, problems would still exist. The steering would become **overly sensitive, where minor steering inputs like accidental bumps could cause the vehicle to swerve or fishtail.** Even with advanced power steering, fully committing both hands to the wheel would be necessary for safe and predictable handling. Casual one-handed driving would become too risky.
### Stability at High Speeds  
At highway speeds, inputs through a 1:1 steering system could displace the vehicle between lanes in just seconds. **Road conditions out of the driver's control like uneven pavement, debris, or wandering could suddenly jerk the wheel and put the car into an uncontrolled skid.** Aerodynamic downforce from rear and front wings could help provide stability, but regular vehicles are not designed for that level of precision.
### Driver Expectations and Habits
Most drivers are used to the characteristics of modern steering ratios from decades of experience. **An immediate switch to pinpoint 1:1 control could confuse and destabilize habits, potentially causing accidents as operators adjust.** Introducing novel steering interfaces also risks surprising and overwhelming typical users accustomed to the conventions of road vehicles. 
### Specialized Applications
While 1:1 ratios are impractical for road cars, they can work well in purpose-built machines designed around that parameter. **Go-karts and motorcycles leverage their lightweight agility to precisely maneuver through tight corners and swift reactions. Racing cars benefit from ultra-sensitive handling to shave milliseconds on lap times.** However, public roads present more variables requiring forgiving control designs.
### Legacy Design Constraints  
Early automobiles lacked power steering, necessitating high ratios for manual operation. **Established steering infrastructures, muscle memory habits, and production standardization make radical changes difficult.** Evolution tends to optimize familiar frameworks incrementally rather than sudden paradigm shifts. New interface ideas may one day enable improved ratios, but gradual adoption allows learning safe usage.
In conclusion, **steering feel, weight impacts, stability concerns, driver expectations, and historic development paths all contribute to ratios beyond 1:1 becoming the automotive industry standard.** While closer control is possible, public roadway risks demand balance between responsiveness and forgiveness in mainstream vehicle handling characteristics.
