### Defending What's Right
Nathan had endured bullying throughout his school years, but one day he witnessed something that made him snap. A group of bullies were tormenting a disabled classmate named John, letting the air out of his wheelchair tires and going through his bag. Nathan stepped in and confronted the bullies, getting John's belongings back for him. Though the bullies tried painting Nathan as the aggressor, the truth came out and two of them received suspensions. Nathan and John became unlikely friends, bonded by their shared experiences.

### Parental Support 
Nathan braced himself for punishment from his parents when he got home, but to his surprise they supported his actions. They were aware of the torment Nathan faced for years and were proud he stood up for someone unable to defend themselves. His mother acknowledged what drove Nathan to break his silence against bullying. Rather than punishment, his parents took time off work to celebrate his courage and take him out. Nathan realized he had people in his corner.
### Confronting Tormentors
While attending **self-defense classes** like kung fu helped Nathan cope with bullying, it took witnessing torment of his classmate John for him to truly confront his problems. In his junior year, a particular bully named Stephen slammed Nathan's locker door into his arm. Drawing on his martial arts training, Nathan retaliated by **breaking Stephen's leg**, sidelining the bully for months. Nathan's father backed him up when the school tried punishing Nathan, pointing out they had failed to curb the bullying. His dad took Nathan to an amusement park to reward his bravery.  
### Zero Tolerance for Harming Others  
The original story's author had [zero patience](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/aburto) for those who targeted the disabled or allowed such behavior. They commended Nathan for following his moral compass and warning the bully first before intervening, as well as praised his parents for being proud of Nathan's good character. While schools too often chastise victims for defending themselves, one must confront intolerable situations and support those displaying courage and compassion.
### A Meaningful Friendship
Out of adversity came an unlikely bond between Nathan and John. Beyond just "Chair Dude" and "Knee Dude", they found understanding in each other from shared hardships. John gained an ally willing to stand up for him, while Nathan gained the perspective of someone facing challenges daily. Their friendship highlights how united strength can grow from defending each other against oppression. Facing discrimination breeds camaraderie between even the unlikeliest of people.
### Lessons to Instill
Any parent would feel pride in a child displaying the selflessness, bravery and justice Nathan embodied. It is every guardian's duty to impart such virtues. Make sure your children know right from wrong, and that defending basic human decency against tormentors will be supported, not punished. Teach them to lift up those cast down, as Nathan lifted up John. With guidance, more youth will follow Nathan's example of empowering the oppressed rather than empowering themselves through others' suffering. Compassion begins at home.
### Continuing the Crusade 
Though the immediate bullies faced consequences, the insidious societal roots of their behavior remain. Nathan and his family's story sends a message that more must be done to curb bullying and champion Disability Rights. We must foster cultures where all people feel safe, secure and able to reach their fullest potential without fear of harm or discrimination. Nathan took the first step - now it is on all of us to continue the crusade for justice, walking beside him in solidarity till oppression is history. Where one door closes, another opens; may this new chapter bring hope.
