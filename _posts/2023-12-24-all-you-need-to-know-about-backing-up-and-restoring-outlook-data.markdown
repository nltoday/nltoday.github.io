## Understanding How Outlook Stores Data
Outlook stores all of your email, contacts, calendar events and other data in a file known as a Personal Folders File (.pst) or an Outlook Data File (.ost).

These files contain all the items within your Outlook folders like the Inbox, Sent Items, Contacts etc. It is important to back up these files regularly to avoid losing any important data in case of a hard drive failure, computer crash or accidental deletion.

There are several ways to back up the Outlook data file depending on your individual needs and preferences. **Outlook PST backup storage longtail keyword**.
One of the most common methods is to simply copy the .pst or .ost file to an external storage device like a USB flash drive or an external hard drive and store it in a safe location. This provides an offline backup that is protected from system failures. Periodically replacing the backup with an updated version ensures all changes are covered.
Another convenient option is to backup Outlook files to the cloud by uploading them to a cloud storage service like Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive and others. This allows accessing the backup from any device as long as you have an internet connection. It also automatically updates the files whenever changes are made.
In businesses, it is recommended to backup Outlook data to a network location periodically. This provides centralized backup that can be easily accessed by IT administrators for restoration in case of issues. 
Tape drives provide a low-cost and high-capacity solution for backing up large mailboxes in large organizations on a regular schedule. The tapes can then be safely stored offsite for disaster recovery purposes.

### Locating the Backup File
The first step is to locate the backup .pst or .ost file that needs to be restored. This can be on an external drive, network share or cloud storage depending on how it was backed up.
