ARMY understands that BTS deserves normal private lives away from their careers as global superstars. Here are some reasons why privacy is so important for BTS and why ARMY tries their best to respect appropriate boundaries.
### Giving Space Means Giving Peace of Mind
BTS works tirelessly to create amazing music and content for fans, on top of a relentless schedule of performances, interviews, and other commitments. **They deserve time to recharge without constant intrusion into their personal lives.** Respecting their privacy allows BTS to feel less stressed and more at ease when they're not working. This space is critical for their well-being and ability to continue inspiring millions with their talents.

### Too Much Attention Can Become Toxic
While most fans show BTS love and support, an obsessive minority known as sasaengs have infringed heavily on their privacy through stalking and other disturbing behaviors. **This type of toxic attention poses real risks to BTS's safety, health, and peace of mind.** As caring fans, we must protect BTS from such harms by discouraging excessive intrusions and setting appropriate boundaries. Their privacy and safety should always come before any individual fan's desires.
### Idols Deserve Normal Lives Too 
Despite their fame, BTS are still human beings with families, friends, hobbies and private dreams beyond their careers. **Respecting privacy allows BTS to experience normal rites of passage and relationships outside the spotlight.** No one, not even the most talented artists, should have to sacrifice their personal lives and sense of individuality for their work. A healthy work-life balance is crucial for BTS's long-term wellbeing and happiness.
### Mutual Trust Between Artists and Fans
A relationship of mutual trust and respect has always been important to BTS and ARMY's special bond. **By respecting appropriate privacy, ARMY demonstrates faith in BTS's talent and character rather than obsessing over their private lives.** In turn, BTS can feel comfortable sharing their art and message without constant invasion. This bond of trust sustains both BTS and ARMY's passions over the years and empowers their positive influence on society.
### Celebrating BTS Means Celebrating Their Humanity  
Above all, we celebrate and support BTS not just as global icons, but as fellow humans deserving of happiness, growth and privacy like all people. **Respecting appropriate boundaries allows us to honor BTS's incredible talents while also validating their everyday humanity.** It's a humble reminder that for all their success, BTS remain people first - and people deserve private personal lives free of unwanted intrusions, no matter their fame or influence.
In conclusion, respecting BTS's reasonable privacy through appropriate boundaries is the healthiest way for ARMY to show our love and support over the long run. It protects their safety and wellbeing, honors their humanity beyond fame, and sustains the relationship of mutual trust between dedicated artists and caring fans.
