### Cleaning the Drain and Hose
One of the primary reasons for odor buildup in top load washers is poor drainage. Check that your machine is properly draining water after each cycle by gently rocking the agitator and listening for sloshing. Also, lift up the drain hose to ensure it's not clogged. Remove any debris blocking the flow of water.

### Inspecting and Cleaning the Basin
Take a close look inside the washer basin for any residue or items trapped underneath or inside the agitator. Use a cloth to wipe away any [gunk buildup in the washing machine basin](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/abele). Be sure to remove anything obstructing water movement during the wash cycle.
### Adding Bleach to Whiten Fabric
Run a load using the max water level and including 1/4 to 1/2 cup of **bleach for washing machine**. Bleach helps eliminate odor-causing bacteria and whitens fabric. Use the recommended amount on the bleach container label. Be sure to select a water temperature hot enough to activate the bleach. 
### Using Odor Eliminating Pods or Powder
If your washer has a "clean" cycle, use it with a single POD or POWDER designed specifically for **cleaning the washing machine naturally**. These products cut through dirt and odors without harsh chemicals. Add the pod or powder directly to an empty drum and run the cycle.
### Drying Out the interior
Keep the washer lid propped open when not in use to allow airflow. Trapped moisture is a breeding ground for mold and mildew. Regular air drying helps remove excess moisture from hard-to-reach areas inside the machine.
### Scrubbing Gaskets and Seals 
Wiping away debris stuck in crevices isn't enough. Use a toothbrush or small brush to scrub stubborn residue from rubber **gaskets and seals around the washer**. Pay special attention to folds and corners where grime can build up over time.
### Vinegar or Bleach Wash
For a deep clean, run the washer through a cycle with 1 cup of white **vinegar for washing machine cleaning** or bleach and no clothing load. The acid in vinegar or bleach cuts through buildup, deodorizes, and disinfects. Always use gloves and ventilate when using harsh chemicals. 
### Keeping the Lid Open
After cleaning, make sure to always prop the washer lid open after each use. Allowing the interior to thoroughly air dry prevents the return of odors. Frequent cleaning and drying are key to keeping your top loader smelling fresh.
