There are a few online options to try finding your old VTU semester results. [vtu fast results](https://yt.io.vn/collection/abundis) is a website that hosts digital copies of semester marksheets from previous years. While convenient, it is important to note that any changes made later through re-evaluation or supplementary exams will not be reflected here. The site only shows your original marks from the first attempt. 
Another option is **results.vtuconnect.in**, the official VTU results portal. However, semester results may only remain active here for around 3 months after publication. So this method works best if trying to access results from the past year or two. The **vtu4u** website also used to host old semester marks, but it seems to be non-functional currently. Hopefully the site will be back up and running again soon.
### Contacting Your College Directly
For results older than a few semesters, your best bet is contacting the college you studied at directly. Most institutes maintain hard copy records of all student marksheets going back several years. You can visit the exam or administration department in person and request copies of your past semester results. Some colleges may charge a small fee for processing and providing duplicate marksheets.

### Filing a Request with VTU
As a last resort, you can write formally to VTU requesting your old semester marks. The university maintains centralized records of all results. However, to access these you need to fill a prescribed application form detailing the semesters you need marks for. You may have to pay a processing fee as well. It can take 2-4 weeks for VTU to process such requests and provide you with authenticated marksheet copies depending on the backlog. So this is a longer approach than the other options.
### Important Points to Remember 
A few important points to keep in mind regardless of the method used:
- Results older than 3-5 years may not be available digitally through online portals or the college website. You will need to contact the institute directly. 
- Any performance improvements after re-evaluation or supplementary exams conducted later will not reflect in the original semester marks accessed.
- There may be nominal processing fees involved depending on how and from where you retrieve old results - college, VTU, or through RTI application.
- Confirm requirements like application form, valid ID proof, and payment details in advance based on the route chosen.
With some searching across these options, you should be able to lay your hands on past semester result marksheets from your VTU degree course, regardless of how many years ago it may have been. Perseverance and following due process are key.
### Contacting the College Exam Department
Paying a visit to your college exam department in person is one of the more reliable ways to obtain older VTU semester results. Every institute maintains hard copies of student marksheets from previous academic years in their records section. Simply go to the college during working hours and ask to speak to someone from the exam wing. Clearly state that you need copies of your semester marks from a specific time period in your degree course. 
They should be able to pull out the files and provide photocopies on the spot, given you furnish your enrollment number and a valid photo ID for verification. Most colleges charge a small nominal fee ranging from Rs. 50-100 for processing and issuing duplicate marksheets. It's a hassle-free procedure if done in person that ensures you walk away with authenticated copies of the needed old result marks on the same day.
### Filling the Application for VTU Records
As the central body overseeing all academic matters, VTU maintains centralized digitized records of semester marks going back over a decade. However, to access past marks directly from them requires filling a formal application. You need to download the 'Application for Request of Marks Card' form from the VTU website. Fill in personal details like registration number, exam year, and specify clearly the semester(s) required in the table provided. 
Attach photocopies of ID proof and original degree certificate. Then send the filled form along with a processing fee (currently Rs. 500) via speed post or courier to the Controller of Examinations office at VTU. It usually takes 2-3 weeks to process such requests given their volume. You will then be posted the authenticated photocopies of the marksheets to the address mentioned. While time-consuming, this ensures obtaining your old VTU results even decades later through official university records.
### Checking Results Through VTU Affiliated College
For students who have completed their VTU degree a long time ago and their original college is no longer operational, they can visit the exam section of any currently affiliated institute instead. All active VTU Engineering colleges maintain a centralized database of past student details and semester marks as part of university records backup. 
Simply visit such a local college with valid ID proof like Aadhaar or Pan Card for identification. Inform them you need access to older VTU degree result marks and provide your basic enrollment details. The exam department should then be able to check electronic records and print copies of the required marksheets on payment of a nominal charge regardless of whether you studied there originally or not. This serves as a good alternative route for alumni seeking distant past VTU academic records.
### Conclusion
In conclusion, with some patient effort and by following the standard procedures outlined, you should be able to lay your hands on photocopies of even decade-old VTU semester result marks. The options range from quick online checks, visiting your parent institute, directly contacting VTU through the formal application route or checking via any VTU-affiliated college locally. Perseverance and clarity on requirements are key to ultimately retrieving those important academic records from years gone by.
