Instagram does not currently provide the ability to directly see who has viewed your videos on the platform. However, there are some insights you can gather about your video engagement. 
## Understanding Video Interactions 
Instagram prioritizes showing videos to accounts' followers in the feed. This means the majority of video views will come from your existing followers. **While you can't see a direct viewership count, likes, comments and shares offer indirect clues about engagement.** 
If a video receives a high number of these interactions shortly after being posted, it's likely many of your followers viewed it. Videos with sustained interactions over days or weeks also tend to have been seen by more accounts. Of course, some people may watch without interacting too.
### Analyzing Early Activity 
The first hour after posting is very important for indications of viewership. A video that gets many likes and comments early on probably had a good number of initial views from followers seeing it in their feed. Sustained early activity over the first few hours also hints at strong early viewership.

## Leveraging Video Insights 
Instagram does provide some viewership metrics, just not detailed view counts for individual accounts. In the Instagram mobile app, tapping on the three dot menu above a video allows seeing statistics like impressions, reach, likes and saves over time. 
### Understanding Impressions
The [impressions](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/aggarwal) metric estimates the number of times your video was shown to accounts, either in the feed or elsewhere on Instagram like Explore. A high impression count relative to your following size implies the video reached beyond just followers into broader Instagram.
## Encouraging Interactions  
To help infer video viewership without direct counts, focus on increasing interactions through compelling content and calls to action. Asking viewers a question, using relevant hashtags or requesting they share all encourage engagement that provides clues about how many people saw the video.
### Implementing Calls to Action
Strong **calls to action** in your video or caption make it more likely people will interact if they watch. Ask them to like, comment or share if they found it useful. You could also have them tag friends or answer a poll to gauge interest in a topic. The more people interact, the clearer the video reached a wider audience.
## Analyzing Engagement Over Time  
Viewing video insights and interaction rates over hours, days and weeks gives a fuller picture of viewership trends beyond just the initial post. Sustained high levels of daily likes and comments imply consistent views by new and followers alike. Engagement that tapers off quickly means the initial reach was limited. 
### Understanding Declines  
A sharp early drop in daily likes or shares usually means the video did not reach broadly or keep people's interest long-term. More gradual, steady declines over the first few days post is typical as the video gets seen by successively less accounts over time. This still shows it engaged audiences beyond the first impressions.
## Alternate Metrics for Viewership
While direct view counts remain elusive, the combination of interactions, impressions, reach trends over time and benchmarking against similar content provide reasonable proxies for video viewership without viewership numbers. With experimentation and data collection over multiple videos, insights into what drives views can be inferred.
### Benchmarking Against Peers  
Comparing key metrics like early likes per follows against industry peers of similar sizes offers additional context for video performance. Sustained higher levels of interactions compared to benchmarks hints the video had stronger viewership across Instagram. Over time, these indirect views help optimize for capturing larger audiences.
## Conclusion 
Though not a perfect solution, leveraging all the available insights, metrics and comparisons available provides a good sense of video viewership trends without direct counts. With testing and learning what drives increased engagement for your content and audience, proxies can be improved to better infer viewership across Instagram videos into the future.
