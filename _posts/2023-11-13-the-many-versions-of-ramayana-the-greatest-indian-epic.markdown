## The Oldest Version
The Ramayana is one of the most important epics in Hinduism and it exists in various versions across India and Southeast Asia. The oldest recognized version of the Ramayana is the [Sanskrit version](https://yt.io.vn/collection/alameda) attributed to the sage Narada, known as the **Mula Ramayana**. According to scholars, Narada passed on the knowledge of the Ramayana to **Valmiki**, who is considered to be the author of the original **Valmiki Ramayana**. This oldest surviving version in Sanskrit is dated between 500-100 BCE and consists of about 24,000 verses spread over seven chapters or **Kandas**. 
### The Story of Valmiki Ramayana
The Valmiki Ramayana narrates the story of **Rama**, who is considered the seventh avatar of **Vishnu**. It tells the tale of Prince Rama's exile to the forest for 14 years with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana. During their exile, the demon king **Ravana** abducts Sita and takes her to Lanka. With the help of Hanuman and an army of monkeys, Rama battles Ravana and rescues Sita. The story highlights the inherent Hindu virtues of dharma, devotion, courage and morality.

The work is praised for its well-constructed plot, multi-layered characters and powerful storytelling. It has long been considered as one of the greatest works in classical Sanskrit literature.
