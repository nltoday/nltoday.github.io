### # The Proposal
Mr. M was an ambitious advocate in his mid-thirties based in Mangalore, Karnataka. He was actively looking for a suitable life partner. One day, through an old friend, he came to know about Ms. S, a beautiful and elegant advocate residing in Coorg with her ex-military father Mr. D. Intrigued, Mr. M decided to visit Coorg to see Ms. S for himself. 
Upon meeting Ms. S at the local civil court, Mr. M was instantly smitten by her charm and grace. He knew she was the one he wanted to spend the rest of his life with. Before returning to Mangalore, he paid a visit to Mr. D's xerox shop to introduce himself. Mr. D, with his strict military background, did not make a great first impression. However, undeterred, Mr. M devised a plan to win over Mr. D.

### # A Persuasive Letter
Back in Mangalore, Mr. M penned down a well-crafted letter to Mr. D, requesting for Ms. S's hand in marriage. With his persuasive words and lawyerly skills, he was able to convince Mr. D, who agreed subject to [matching of horoscopes](https://store.fi.io.vn/work-hard-so-my-rat-terrier-live-a-better-dog-lover-2), a common practice in Indian arranged marriages.
### # Horoscope Matching
The very next day, Mr. D shared Ms. S's horoscope details with Mr. M, asking for his in return. However, Mr. M was an atheist who did not believe the positioning of celestial bodies had any bearing on one's life. To bypass the horoscope matching, he paid an astrologer to prepare a fake horoscope that exactly mirrored Ms. S's. He sent this forged horoscope to Mr. D.
### # Seeking a Second Opinion 
When Mr. D showed the proposed horoscope match to his trusted astrologer, he warned of troubles unless a puja was performed. As with medical opinions, Mr. D sought a second view. The second astrologer concurred it was a **perfect astrological match**. Reassured, Mr. D gave his consent for the engagement.
### # A Blissful Marriage
Despite the deception with horoscopes, Mr. M and Ms. S's marriage in the following months was a success. Over the past 22 years, they have built a happy family together with two daughters. The story proves that sometimes, **true love prevails over fate and superstition**.
