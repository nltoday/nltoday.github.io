### Early Days of Hope and Confusion 
When I was in class 9, all my friends were joining FIITJEE and it seemed like the natural next step given my academic performance. I had always ranked first in my class and enjoyed science subjects, so FIITJEE appeared to be a perfect fit. Additionally, I received a generous 90% scholarship which further convinced me to join their 4-year program. However, the reality was quite different from what was advertised. [From the very beginning](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-summer-vintage3422-t-shirt), concepts from class 11 were taught without proper grounding in fundamentals. I struggled to understand anything and came home feeling demoralized. Watching tutorials online provided some clarity but was still not enough. My scores started declining rapidly as I kept falling behind.

### Rudeness of Teachers and Lack of Support
The teachers at FIITJEE showed little patience or empathy. If I ever dared ask a doubt, I would be **publicly humiliated in front of everyone**. Once, after a math teacher berated me intensely, I cried in the washroom during break time. I began dreading Fridays when classes were held, as the **toxic environment** took a toll on my mental health. Doubt sessions provided no real help either - it was all just performative. When my parents attended parent-teacher meetings, only criticism was voiced about my supposed lack of ability. No constructive feedback was given to improve. The only teacher who supported me was the chemistry faculty, who thankfully took time to answer queries patiently.
### Deteriorating Performance and Self-Esteem 
Not surprisingly, given the circumstances, my performance kept declining each test. Ranks of 25, 43 and 50 filled me with shame. I was made to feel like a **"complete failure"**. My father would routinely beat me for the low scores, which I couldn't blame him for given the money spent. All hope seemed lost until a small breakthrough - through focused independent study, I managed rank 17 in a test. However, the damage had already been done to my confidence levels. Most weekends were spent dreading the 6-hour classes without any real learning happening. I began having suicidal thoughts, wondering if I was truly as **incompetent** as the teachers claimed.
### Discovering Free Resources and a Better Approach
In 10th grade, I resolved to help myself instead of relying on FIITJEE. I explored free education platforms and courses online. Lectures from Mohit Tyagi, Kailash Sharma, Himanshu Sachdeva and others proved revelatory. With their step-by-step explanations and patience, concepts suddenly became clear. Unacademy live classes filled gaps in knowledge. Most importantly, I was able to learn at my own pace without pressure. This self-study approach gave me time to **thoroughly understand foundations** instead of being rushed through the curriculum. My interests in coding also emerged during this phase of discovery. 
### Reflection and Advice for Aspiring Students
Looking back, I realize FIITJEE was the wrong decision so early on. **Advanced portions without basics** only led to confusion. The **toxic environment** destroyed my self-esteem instead of nurturing it. Now in 12th grade, through disciplined independent study and following my passion for coding, I feel prepared to achieve my goals. My message is - do not fall for coaching marketing. Explore free resources, learn at your own pace by enjoying the process. Focus on understanding, not just marks. And most importantly, never compromise your well-being or dignity due to any institution. You have so much potential; believe in yourself!
