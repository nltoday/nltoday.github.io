## The Supply Chain and Production Advantages
The garment industry supply chain is highly optimized in China and Bangladesh. Key raw materials like cotton are abundant and locally sourced. Cotton is processed into yarn and fabric within the region. Accessories like buttons are also locally manufactured. With specialized textile hubs established over decades, manufacturers have excellent connections to materials and component suppliers. Turnaround time from design to shipping finished goods is significantly shorter compared to production overseas. **This rapid production cycle is critical for fast fashion brands** that constantly refresh inventory based on changing consumer demand. 
## Affordable Labor Drives Down Costs 
Cheap labor is another huge factor. Employee wages in China and Bangladesh are a fraction of developed countries. **This low-cost labor pool allows apparel companies to produce clothing at price points consumers expect.** A basic t-shirt can be manufactured for under $2 in China versus $5-7 elsewhere. Even accounting for duties and freight to import finished goods, retailers save substantially versus domestic manufacturing. Cost savings are passed on to consumers through affordable prices that increase accessibility to fashion.
## Established Manufacturing Expertise 
Decades of experience have made certain cities expert hubs for specific textile product categories. For example, Guangzhou in China dominates manufacturing of women's jackets and coats. **Regions develop specialized industrial clusters with supporting industries and supply chains.** Producers gain efficiencies through local connections and build reputations for quality and reliability. Outsourcing to these specialized manufacturing hotspots means brands get the quality and styles they need from reliable partners. 
## Transportation and Logistics Infrastructure 
China and Bangladesh have significant investments in ports, railways, highways that reduce transportation costs. **Modern logistics networks allow efficient movement of materials, parts and finished goods.** Shipping finished apparel from Asia to North America or Europe costs a fraction compared to air freight. Even accounting for ocean transit times of 4-6 weeks, total door-to-door transportation is cheaper versus domestic production and shipping. Proximity to key consumer markets like the US and Europe is another advantage.
## Duty-Free Access to Major Markets
Free trade agreements give Chinese and Bangladeshi exports preferential access and duty exemptions in developed consumer nations. For example, the US grants duty-free GSP preferences to imports from eligible developing countries. Thanks to such policies, clothing, textiles and footwear from Asia face few or no import duties in lucrative Western markets. **This boosts the landed price competitiveness of Asian manufacturing hubs versus domestic or other international alternatives.**
## Local Market Size Supports Scale
With a population of over 1 billion people each, both China and Bangladesh represent enormous local consumer markets for basic apparel as people's incomes rise. **This massive scale allows textile clusters to develop specialized industry clusters supplying global retailers as well as the growing domestic middle class.** High production volumes further reduce unit costs and prices through economies of scale. Proximity to end-markets in Asia, the US, and Europe also streamlines logistics when serving the local population as well. 
In summary, superior supply chain infrastructure, specialized skills, duty preferences, affordable labor and scale economies make Asia dominant in low-cost clothing manufacture. This synergy of multiple location advantages help the industry thrive across the region. For fashion brands and retailers, outsourcing to leading textile hubs optimizes costs and speeds production cycles to satisfy diverse global demand. The benefits of Asian sourcing are unlikely to diminish any time soon.
