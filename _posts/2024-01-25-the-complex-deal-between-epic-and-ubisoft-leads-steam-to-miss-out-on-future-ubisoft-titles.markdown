### How the Exclusive Deal Came to Be
Epic Games entered into an exclusive deal with Ubisoft in 2020 to distribute their upcoming PC games exclusively on the Epic Games Store for one year. As one of the largest third-party publishers, this was a major coup for Epic in their effort to compete against dominant storefront Steam. The exact financial terms of the deal were not disclosed but is believed to involve [substantial guaranteed minimum sales](https://store.fi.io.vn/white-frenchie-french-bulldog-starry-night-van-gogh-colorful-2) in exchange for exclusivity. 
For Ubisoft, the deal provided a steady revenue stream as they transition more games to use their Ubisoft Connect platform. The exclusivity period also gave them bargaining power in negotiations with digital storefronts. With their extensive catalog and new AAA games, Ubisoft was in a strong position to get favorable terms from Epic.

### Backlash from Steam Gamers
When news of the Ubisoft deal broke, there was significant backlash from Steam gamers who were used to having all PC games available on Valve's dominant storefront. For years, Steam had enjoyed being the default choice for most multiplatform games without serious competition. Now gamers would need to use a different store just to play new Ubisoft releases. 
Comments on gaming forums and social media expressed frustration over the Epic exclusives that were perceived as **segmenting the PC gaming audience.** Some even vowed to boycott Ubisoft games during the exclusivity period in protest. However, dedicated fans still looking forward to franchises like Far Cry and Assassin's Creed had little choice but to use Epic if they wanted to play the new entries upon launch.
### The Impact on Steam's Business Model 
Steam's business model had always involved taking a cut of sales from third-party games sold on their platform. Losing out on Ubisoft's lucrative new games was a financial blow, even if they still hosted the publisher's back catalog. It set an unwelcome precedent that more developers could partner with Epic for exclusives, further reducing Steam's control over PC game distribution.
In response, Valve tried to sweeten developer revenue sharing deals and rolled out new features to remain competitive. But the damage was done, and there was a perception that Steam's grip on the market was weakening as Epic challenged the status quo with exclusive "store wars." This deal showed it was possible for big publishers to bypass Steam if the financial incentives were compelling enough.
### Benefits for Ubisoft and Their Choice of Exclusivity  
For Ubisoft, the Epic deal had clear short-term benefits. It guaranteed sales from Epic's sizable userbase without needing to spend on marketing and promotion. The upfront funding also aided long-term investments in their titles and platforms. Choosing a single digital store also simplified distribution instead of fragmenting across multiple storefronts. 
Exclusivity forced gamers to use Ubisoft Connect and Epic Games Store where they would be exposed to other Ubisoft games and content. This helped boost discovery and had the potential to increase future sales from the captive audience. In the long run, Ubisoft aimed to transition more players to their own platform for **seamless cross-platform experiences.**
### Divided Community Reaction 
The exclusive deal was certainly controversial in the PC gaming community. While some understood the business reasons behind it, there was frustration over the fragmentation of the platform. Dedicated fans still looked forward to the new games but disliked being forced to use a different store that was missing features like user reviews and social features. 
However, die-hard Ubisoft fans said they did not mind the temporary inconvenience for access to coveted franchises. More cynical players saw it as a good opportunity to send a message by boycotting or waiting for the games to come to Steam later. In any case, it sparked a lot of discussion around the pros and cons of exclusives in an otherwise open PC gaming ecosystem.
### Long-term Impact on the Gaming Industry
The Epic vs Steam "store wars" exacerbated by Ubisoft's exclusive deal marked a major shift in the competitive landscape of PC game distribution. Previously, Steam faced little viable competition despite criticisms of their large cut from game sales. The influx of funds from Fortnite allowed Epic to chase exclusives from major third-party publishers. 
While fragmentation is undesirable for gamers, the new competition has pressured Steam to be more developer-friendly. Deals like the one between Epic and Ubisoft also demonstrate that publishers can negotiate better terms than Steam's standard 70-30 revenue split if alternatives emerge. In the long run, the market could see more consumer choice and potentially lower prices as competition intensifies between stores. However, platform fragmentation remains a real concern as well if more exclusives proliferate. The store wars on PC are likely far from over, with winners and losers still to be determined.
