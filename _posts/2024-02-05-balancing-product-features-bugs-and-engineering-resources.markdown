There are many techniques that product teams have tried to balance new product features, bug fixes, and engineering resources. However, finding the right approach is challenging and requires collaboration between product management and engineering. This article explores popular strategies and outlines a framework that prioritizes work based on user impact while respecting engineering bandwidth.
### Focusing on User Value
When deciding between features and bugs, the most important factor should be user value. Prioritizing based on [criticality to users](https://yt.io.vn/collection/ake) and the **number of users affected** ensures teams focus on what matters most. This approach also provides transparency into tradeoffs. However, it still requires negotiation which can be time-consuming. 
Features and bugs exist on a spectrum of value. Those with high criticality and many affected users should take priority over medium or low impact items. For example, a payment processing bug affecting all customers is clearly more important to fix than a minor UI issue encountered by few. Groups like high, medium, and low can help categorize items in a 2-axis graph considering these factors. Applying constraints like deadlines and resources then guides selection from these buckets.

### Reducing Negotiation Through Ownership 
Constantly debating individual items between product and engineering teams increases tension and slows productivity. Atlassian avoids this by assigning clear ownership. They establish a dedicated bug fixing team equal to around 15-20% of total engineering staff. Critically, this protects against temptation to pull resources from fixing existing issues to deliver new features. 
Feature teams also **"own the quality"** of their work through a defined **warranty period** after release. Within this window, any new bugs introduced are their responsibility to fix. This incentivizes thorough testing and quality code. Separating prioritization of fix and feature backlogs, as well as rotating engineers between teams, further reduces competing priorities and workload strain.
### Emphasizing Velocity Through Parallelism  
While ownership models separation of concerns, production still requires **parallelism between fixing and innovating**. At any time, there are many potential **high and medium impact** items in the backlog. Completing only the highest item before starting the next risks slowing overall velocity. 
By addressing a carefully selected **portfolio of priorities concurrently**, teams can make steady progress on both quality and new features. Minor items may get deferred to future sprints. Continuous integration of fixes also avoids potential regression caused by long gaps between code integration periods. Regularly **re-evaluating priorities** based on business context keeps the portfolio dynamic and optimized for current goals.
### Building Quality Culture and Morale
When fixing bugs depends on subjective debates, it risks demoralizing engineers who feel deprioritized versus new initiatives. Repeated rework also hurts productivity long term. **Acknowledging quality as a shared responsibility** addressed through standardized processes promotes a positive culture.
Engineers should feel comfortably autonomous when choosing to fix important issues without explicit permission. Leadership reinforcing quality as a core value creates psychological safety. Methods preventing perception of bugs as “negotiable annoyances” go far in motivating high standards throughout the product lifecycle.
### Enabling Transparency with Data
Visibility into bug behavior, root causes, and technical impediments helps product and engineering align on joint problem solving. Tools providing data on bug trends, common classes, regression frequency, and other **key performance indicators (KPIs)** generate shared understanding. 
This informs staffing models, skills focus areas, technical debt priorities, and process improvements. Data exposes where quality most improves or declines from certain design decisions or engineering practices. It also empowers evaluating hypotheses around warranty periods, bug backlog prioritization methods, and more over time based on measurable outcomes.
### Continuous Improvement Through Reflection
Adapting approaches based on evolving business needs and learnings requires open-mindedness on all sides. Finding the right balance takes time and **flexible experimentation**. Regular check-ins foster reflection on what’s working well and opportunities for enhancement. Success depends on a growth mindset and willingness from leaders to reconsider assumptions. 
Constant refinement leads to sustainable models that maximally drive both innovation and customer satisfaction over the long run. The ideal is continuous improvement through collaborative problem solving instead of debates over short term tactical decisions. By focusing outward on user value and drawing on facts and shared goals, product and engineering can work as aligned partners.
