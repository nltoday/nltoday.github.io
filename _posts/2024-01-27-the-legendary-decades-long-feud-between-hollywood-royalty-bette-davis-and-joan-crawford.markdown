### Professional Beginnings 
Joan Crawford began her acting career in 1925, establishing herself as a prominent Hollywood star much earlier than Bette Davis who transitioned to film in 1930 after gaining stage experience. Their rivalry began in the early 1930s as Davis was emerging as a leading lady. In 1933, Crawford divorced her husband and upstaged Davis's first starring role by dominating headlines, overshadowing the publicity for Davis's film. This is believed to have sparked Davis's resentment towards Crawford.

### Love and Jealousy 
In 1935, Davis fell in love with her **co-star Franchot Tone** on the set of Dangerous but was heartbroken to learn Crawford had already captured his affections. They soon announced their engagement during filming. Crawford's confession that Tone "never thought of [Davis] as a woman" deeply wounded Davis, who never forgave Crawford for taking the man she loved. Their feud was profoundly personal from that point onward. 
### Oscars and One-Uphmanship
At the 1936 Oscars where Davis won for Dangerous, Crawford was allegedly frigid and dismissive towards Davis in what has become legendary Oscar shade. Over the following decades, Crawford and Davis engaged in a [fierce competition for coveted roles](https://store.fi.io.vn/th-of-july-cute-american-flag-funny-poodle-dog-fireworks) originally intended for the other, with Crawford often succeeding both critically and commercially in Davis’s rejected parts.
### Rumored Attraction and Refusal  
In 1950, rumors swirled that **Crawford was sexually curious about Davis** owing to her bisexuality. Davis supposedly refused to star alongside Crawford in the women-in-prison drama Caged, privately calling it "a dyke movie." Whether true or not, such rumblings added further intrigue to their complex, venomous rivalry.
### Onscreen Depictions and Behind-the-Scenes Sabotage
In 1952, Davis gleefully starred as an unflattering depiction of Crawford in the thinly-veiled roman à clef The Star. A decade later when they finally co-starred in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?, their off-camera animosity reached new heights. Davis had soda machines installed just to spite Crawford's Pepsi affiliation. During filming, they engaged in deliberate sabotage, with Crawford once painfully dragging Davis's bad back across a room for retakes.  
### Competing for Oscar Glory    
At the 1963 Oscars recognizing Baby Jane, their final clash came when Crawford campaigned against Davis's nomination and brazenly took to the stage when another actress won, posing with her award in the ultimate power move. Their toxic four-decade feud ended only with Crawford's death in 1977, cementing their unforgettable legacies as two of Hollywood’s greatest female rivals.
