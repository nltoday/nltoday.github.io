### Focusing on Yourself  
As a teenager, it's common to get swept up in the excitement of a new romance and allow everything else to fade into the background. However, this can quickly lead to an unhealthy dependence on your partner for happiness and self-worth. While falling in love feels amazing, it's important to maintain your individual interests, spend time with other friends and focus on personal growth. **Relying on a romantic relationship for your entire identity and sense of fulfillment is not sustainable long-term.**

### Less is More with Communication 
When emotions run high in a new relationship, the desire to constantly be in touch with your partner is understandable. However, this kind of needy and grasping behavior can become stressful for both people over time. Rather than obsessively checking in, it's better to find a communication rhythm that works for both schedules. **Limiting excessive texting and calls respects your partner's other commitments while preserving the intimacy and mystery of the relationship.** Sending the occasional love note or cute picture is enough to stay connected without being overbearing. 
### Make Time for Yourself
Feeling obsessed with a new love is intoxicating but won't lead anywhere positive if you lose sight of your individual self. When this happens, it's important to rediscover other interests and activities that fulfill you independently of the relationship. **Engaging in hobbies, spending quality time with friends, exercise, education and self-improvement are all ways to develop a well-rounded sense of self.** Pursuing goals and passions outside of the romance fosters personal growth for both people while enriching what you can offer the relationship.
### Respect Your Partner's Responsibilities  
In a mature relationship, both people understand that the other has responsibilities beyond the romance like work, school, family and other commitments. While showing affection is important, it needs to be done respectfully without disruption or added stress. **Recognizing that your partner cannot drop everything at a moment's notice to respond demonstrates understanding of their busy lives.** Save deep conversations for times when their focus is available rather than constantly interrupting their workflow with trivial check-ins.
### Communication Works Both Ways
Keeping the lines of open communication is key, but both people need to be considerate of the other's schedules and priorities. Sending a quick "I love you" throughout the day to stay connected is sweet, but long chats may have to wait until breaks. Similarly, **if an emergency arises, your partner deserves to know right away even if they're busy - but mundane updates can probably wait a bit.** Compromise and mutual understanding are important on both sides for a healthy give-and-take.
### Emotional Independence is Healthy 
In any relationship, clinging too tightly can suffocate the very love you want to preserve. Maintaining your own identity, interests and support system of friends and family creates a solid foundation from which to give and receive affection - rather than deriving all sense of worth from another. **Developing emotional independence actually strengthens closeness because it comes from a place of choice rather than desperation.** Loving with an open heart but loose grip allows the relationship to grow organically without force or fear.
### Prioritizing Self-Care 
The healthiest approach to any relationship is one of balance - caring for your partner without neglecting your own well-being. When stresses of life inevitably occur, having established self-care rituals and activities you find meaning in allows you to bring your best and most relaxed self to the relationship. **Making time for exercise, hobbies, relaxing baths, meditation or whatever replenishes your spirit on a regular basis helps you stay present and care for your romantic interest from a place of fullness rather than neediness.** Prioritizing your overall wellness benefits both people in the long run.
### Seeking Wholeness Within  
At the core, relying too heavily on another person to complete us sets both parties up for codependence and an unfulfilling dynamic. While companionship enriches life enormously, the most stable foundation for any relationship comes from appreciating our intrinsic worth beyond roles like husband, wife or partner. **Cultivating self-love, purpose and complexity as an individual independent of romantic bonds promotes security, maturity and fulfilling connections with others from a place of inner fullness instead of craving.** Lasting love recognizes this wholeness within both people.
