## Why Reels and Posts Receive Different Levels of Engagement
Instagram's algorithm is designed to evolve and adapt based on user behavior. This allows the platform to better understand what types of content its audience finds most interesting and engaging. However, the frequent changes can also impact how individual creators' posts perform. In this article, we'll explore some potential reasons why Reels and standard posts may see differing levels of engagement as algorithm updates are rolled out.
### Factors Affecting Reels Visibility 
When creating **short-form video content**, there are a few key things the algorithm considers that could impact how visible your Reels are:
- [Content format](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/paw): As Instagram's first major push into video, the algorithm may prioritize Reels in a user's feed to promote this new feature. Standard photos lack the motion and audio that engages viewers.
- **Engagement tracking**: With a fresh format, it takes time for the algorithm to learn what types of Reels different audience segments prefer. Initial engagement provides data to fine-tune recommendations. 
- **Experimentation**: As with any new tool, Instagram is testing different promotional strategies for Reels. Visibility may fluctuate as tests are run to evaluate engagement and retention rates.

### Differences in Hashtag and Caption Strategies 
The words included in hashtags and captions play a big role in how content is discovered. Consistently using:
- **Related hashtags**: Hashtags related to your niche that your followers commonly search helps content be seen. 
- **Engaging captions**: Attention-grabbing captions with calls-to-action increase chances of stopping on your content.
Ensuring Reels and posts utilize complementary hashtag and caption strategies can help normalize visibility between the two formats.
