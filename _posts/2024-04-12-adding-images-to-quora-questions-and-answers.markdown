### Different Ways to Include Pictures
There are now a few different ways to include images when asking or answering questions on Quora. In the past, you used to only be able to link images in the question source or comments. However, Quora has since expanded the options.
When asking a question, you still have two main options for including an image. The first is linking the image in the question source itself. To do this, you would upload the image file to an image hosting site like Imgur and copy the direct image link. Then paste that link into your question text. 
The secondQuestion option is to post the image as a comment below the question. **While including the image in the question allows it to be seen upfront, many users may not check the comments section**. Since Quora removed detailed question descriptions, users have gotten used to checking comments before answering. However, this practice is far from universal across all Quora users.

### Including Pictures in Answer Posts 
Adding photos to your Quora [answer posts is a simple process](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-holiday-funny-santa-shetland-sheepdog-christmas-tree-2). There are a couple different methods you can use:
The first method uses an image icon that appears above the answer text box. When composing your answer, look for icons representing bold, italics, video, and photo. Click the photo icon to select an image file from your computer to embed directly into the answer. JPEG image files tend to work best.
An alternative is to copy an image from an online source like Google Images. Conduct an image search for the topic, right click the picture you want, and save it to your computer. Then open the image in a program like Paint to trim or edit it as needed. From there, you can copy the edited image and paste it into your answer text on Quora. 
This allows the picture to visually support and enhance the written content of your response. **Including relevant, high-quality images is a great way to make answers more informative and engaging for readers on the Quora platform.**
### Using an External Blog for Detailed Images
In the past when question details were visible, uploading lengthy images directly wasn't as necessary. But now, a viable option is to create a blog specifically for housing detailed pictures. The blog allows for higher resolution uploads than embedding within Quora.
To use this method, first create the blog post with the detailed image(s). Then copy the permalink URL to that post. Paste the URL into the question or answer text on Quora. Clicking the link will redirect readers to the external blog to view the full-sized photograph. 
**This blog method provides a clean way to include detailed images without cluttering up the core Quora content**. It also allows any number of high-resolution photos to supplement the discussion - not just one or two as with embedding. However, it does require the extra step of maintaining an external site specifically for pictures.
### Optimizing Questions and Answers for SEO 
When including images on Quora, it's important to consider search engine optimization (SEO) best practices as well. Optimize image file names, alt text descriptions, and surrounding content for relevant **longtail keywords like "how to add photos to Quora answers"**. 
Focusing on valuable, descriptive details that help answerers and search engines understand the image subject matter and purpose. Take advantage of bolded keywords in the subheadings and content as natural ways to emphasize core topics.
Well structured questions and answers that clearly convey crucial information in an easy to read format will perform better both on Quora and in search engines over time. Applying SEO strategies can boost questions and answers further up in related search results.
