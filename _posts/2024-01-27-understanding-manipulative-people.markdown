Manipulative individuals often display charming behaviors and compliments to instantly win people over. However, there are telltale signs that can help identify their true nature.
### Love Bombing and Excessive Praise
One common tactic manipulators use is love bombing newcomers with compliments like "you are awesome" and "you're the best". They send unprompted texts telling the recipient how amazing they are. This creates a sense that the manipulator has been waiting to meet the target of their affection for a long time. Excessive praise from someone who barely knows you is a major red flag, as it often masks an ulterior motive to control and manipulate.

### Deflecting Blame and Gaslighting
Manipulators refuse to take responsibility for their own actions. Someone or something else is always to blame for any issues or conflicts. If confronted about problematic behaviors, they will accuse the other person of being too sensitive, self-centered, or simply imagining things. This phenomenon of distorting reality to make the victim question their own judgment and perceptions is known as "gaslighting". It allows the manipulator to avoid accountability.
### Always Being Right
In a manipulator's world, they are always correct while others are perpetually mistaken. The opinions, feelings and interests of anyone who challenges them will be constantly disputed, belittled or dismissed. There is no room for compromise as the manipulator sees only their perspective as valid. This breeds an unhealthy dynamic where the manipulator gains complete control through asserting their warped version of "right" and "wrong".
### Faking Emotions for Self-Serving Reasons
Some manipulators rely on affecting false emotions like self-pity to garner sympathy and compliments from others. By painting themselves as victims, they seek reassurance of their own worth while avoiding responsibility. The emotions are not genuine displays of vulnerability, but strategic tools to manipulate others into propping up the manipulator's fragile ego. 
### Setting People Up to Fail and Undermining Trust
Manipulators find subtle ways to undermine people and erode their confidence over time. They might set others up to fail or look foolish in front of peers in order to assert dominance. Repeated offenses diminish the target's sense of safety, weakening the foundation of trust within the relationship. This grants the manipulator more power through the vulnerabilities they helped to create.
### Friendliness Masking a Sinister Agenda
On the surface, manipulators seem overly friendly and helpful. But beneath lies an agenda to exploit and control others for selfish gains. Favors are not acts of goodwill, but opportunities to accrue influence and leverage over time. Once trust is established, manipulators will betray confidence and backstab former "friends" through spreading rumors or gossip. Their charm is just a disguise for treachery.
### Red Flags of a Potential Manipulator
There are telltale signs worth looking out for with new acquaintances. Excessive compliments and attention, especially from someone you barely know, should raise suspicion of an ulterior motive behind the flattery. Watch for those who violate normal social boundaries by probing for private details too soon. Possessiveness and an inability to accept the word "no" are major red flags. Ultimately, listen to your intuition - if a "gut feeling" says someone can't be trusted, it's usually right. Paying attention to subtle cues can help identify potential manipulators before they do real harm.
In conclusion, manipulative individuals rely on deception, blame-shifting, and emotional manipulation to control others for selfish gain. While charm offers an initial disguise, their toxic behaviors steadily emerge over time once trust is established. Learning to spot warning signs early can help avoid the damage caused by manipulators attempting to prey on innocent victims. Maintaining healthy boundaries and trusting one's intuition are important safeguards against such toxic individuals.
