## Making Sense of the Information Given
The passage provides key details about a puzzle involving a man eating bananas over 5 consecutive days. To solve this, we must first understand the scenario clearly. 
It is stated that the man ate a total of 100 bananas. We are also given the table showing the pattern of banana consumption each day if we assume he ate 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 bananas respectively on the first to fifth days. However, this totals to 90 bananas, not 100 as mentioned. So there is a remaining amount of 10 bananas to be accounted for. 
### **Mathematical equations, unknown variables** 
By splitting this remaining 10 bananas equally among the 5 days, we get an addition of 2 bananas per day. Adding this to the assumed amounts gives the final amounts as 8, 14, 20, 26 and 32 bananas on the 5 days respectively. This now totals to 100 bananas.
So in summary, we have the total bananas eaten as 100, the pattern of consumption showing increments of 6 each day, and the need to solve for the starting amount on day 1 represented by the unknown variable x.

## Formulating the Mathematical Equation
### [Setting up the unknown variable](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/aguillon)
To set up the equation, we introduce 'x' as the unknown variable representing the number of bananas eaten on the first day. 
### **Writing the equation**
The equation equates the total bananas (100) to the sum of bananas eaten each day, where the amounts are represented as x, x+6, x+12 and so on in increments of 6 for the remaining days. 
This gives the equation as: 100 = x + (x+6) + (x+12) + (x+18) + (x+24)
## Solving the Equation
### **Simplifying the equation** 
The like terms are combined by taking x as the common term. This gives: 100 = 5x + 60
### **Evaluating for the unknown variable**
By subtracting 60 from both sides and dividing both sides by 5, we get the value of x as 8.
Therefore, the number of bananas eaten on the first day is 8.
## Verifying the Solution
### **Substituting the value in the pattern**
When we substitute x = 8 in the pattern, it gives the amounts as:
Day 1: 8 
Day 2: 8 + 6 = 14
Day 3: 8 + 12 = 20 
Day 4: 8 + 18 = 26
Day 5: 8 + 24 = 32
### **Adding up the amounts** 
The total of these amounts is 8 + 14 + 20 + 26 + 32 = 100 bananas.
Since this matches the given total, the solution of x = 8 or the bananas on first day being 8 is validated.
## Alternative Approach
### **Simpler equation setup using incremental differences**
Instead of setting the equation up with incremental additions of 6, it can be set up using incremental differences of -12, -6, 0, 6, 12 between consecutive terms. 
This makes the equation: 100 = x - 12 + (x - 6) + x + (x + 6) + (x + 12)
The differences cancel out directly, avoiding the need for further simplification. Then we can easily see x = 20.
A small tweak allows this to work for even number of days also. This provides an easier alternative way to solve the puzzle.
