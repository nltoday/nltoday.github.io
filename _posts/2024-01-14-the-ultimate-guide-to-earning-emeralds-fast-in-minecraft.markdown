### Automatic Farms are Key
One of the fastest ways to earn emeralds is by setting up various automatic farms that produce items villagers will readily trade for emeralds. Some top farms to consider include iron farms, bamboo farms, carrot/potato farms, and mob farms that produce bone meal, string or leather. Each of these farms can provide a steady supply of tradable goods with minimal ongoing effort required by the player once built.

### Iron Farms are Highly Profitable  
Iron farms take advantage of the villagers' natural fear of zombies to continuously spawn and kill iron golems, dropping loads of iron ingots. These ingots can then be traded with **armourers, blacksmiths and toolsmiths villagers** for emeralds at very reasonable exchange rates of 4-8 ingots per emerald. With the right design, an iron farm can produce stacks of iron per hour, translating to a solid stream of emerald income.
### Bamboo Farms are Ideal Early Game
Bamboo grows extremely quickly and a good bamboo farm design can output more [bamboo sticks](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-unicorn3847-t-shirt) than you'll know what to do with. Fletcher villagers will exchange a hefty 32 sticks for 1 emerald, though the volume of sticks from an automated bamboo farm more than makes up for the unfavorable exchange rate. Bamboo is also renewable and doesn't require planting new saplings like a wood farm.
### Large Vegetable Farms are Highly Efficient  
Fully automatic carrot, potato and beetroot farms paired with farmer villagers are one of the easiest and most profitable ways to start accumulating emeralds early on. While **farmer villagers demand 22-28 vegetables for just 1 emerald each trade,** the productivity of large-scale vegetable farms more than outweighs this downside. Plus, carrots have additional uses like golden carrots that provide benefits outside of trading.
### Mob Farms Produce Great Byproducts   
Mob farms designed for drops like **bones, string or leather** tap additional income streams beyond direct monster drops. Bones can rapidly be converted to dye using bone meal then traded at high volume to shepherd villagers. Likewise, **fletcher villagers will exchange string for emeralds** in good quantity. Paired with the right profession, mob farms become multifaceted money-makers.
### De-Zombifying Villagers is Crucial
An often overlooked way to improve villager trading profits substantially is by curing zombie villagers. This **reduces the exchange rates villagers demand** for the same goods by around 30% on average. The small effort of de-zombifying makes all trades much more lucrative in the long run and villages more self-sustaining. It's a crucial technique for maximizing profits from automated farms.
### Villages Increase Overall Wealth  
While individual automated farms produce reliable emerald incomes, the true economic potential emerges by combining everything into bustling self-sufficient villages. With a little management of trades and professions, villages add synergistic dimensions like **leather workers using rabbit skins from farms** or **paper trades fueling librarian progress.** Well-designed villages powered by integrated farms become emerald printing machines with constant residual income.
### Diversity is Key to Long Term Success
Rather than concentrating on just one or two top farms, the most resilient emerald-generating strategy takes a diversified approach. **Having automated sources of iron, bamboo, carrots, bones, string, leather and more** ensures any market fluctuations or trading nerfs don't cause total collapse. It also opens up maximizing profits from the widest range of villager trades possible. Overall, diversification across different professions and tradable goods builds foolproof economic longevity.
In summary, the fastest routes to emeralds involve automation through strategic farm designs coupled with villager trading. Large-scale singular farms unlock initial potential, while blending integrated infrastructure across villages takes trading profits to their zenith long term through diversification. With some planning and the right farms, endless wealth in emeralds becomes easily achievable.
