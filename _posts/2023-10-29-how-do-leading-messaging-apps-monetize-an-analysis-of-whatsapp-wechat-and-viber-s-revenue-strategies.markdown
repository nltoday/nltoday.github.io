## Early Subscription Models
In their early days, some messaging apps experimented with subscription models to generate revenue. WhatsApp adopted this approach when it launched, charging $0.99 for the first year and then $0.99 annually. This helped it accumulate about 700 million paying users before being acquired by Facebook. Viber also offered a free trial followed by an annual subscription. However, subscription fatigue set in over time as users expected basic communication features to remain free. 
## Freemium Services and Value-Added Features
Recognizing users' preference for free basic services, messaging platforms transitioned to freemium models focusing on value-added premium offerings. WhatsApp discontinued subscriptions and introduced [WhatsApp Business](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/alamillo) to help companies communicate with customers. This provides tools like catalogues, customer care options and analytics dashboards. WeChat operates mini-programs within the app for services like payments, gaming and entertainment. Both monetize these additional services. Viber launched features like **Viber Out** for low-cost international calls and **Viber Shop** for ecommerce.
## Leveraging Existing User Base 
Given their huge networks, these platforms can promote complementary services to existing users very cost-effectively. WeChat earns revenue through payments, games and ads within the app's ecosystem of 1 billion monthly users. Facebook leverages WhatsApp's massive reach for initiatives like **Click to WhatsApp ads** that directly start conversations. This expands the addressable market for advertisers on Facebook and Instagram without needing to acquire new users.
### Integrated Payments 
By facilitating peer-to-peer and merchant payments through the app itself, these companies introduce frictionless transactions and take a transaction fee. WeChat Pay has become a default option in China due to its seamlessness. WhatsApp piloted **WhatsApp Pay** in Brazil with plans for India. Integrating financial services allows expanding from a communication tool to a platform for various activities.

### Monetizing Data Insights
With location sharing, contacts access and frequent usage providing high-quality user behavior data, these platforms offer insights to enterprises. **WhatsApp Business** profiles provide demographic and interest details of users engaging with a business. Businesses tap such real-time analytics for location-based campaigns and customer relationship efforts. While privacy is a concern, anonymous insights have commercial utility.
## Growth Mindset Over Immediate Profits 
Despite innovative monetization strategies, core messaging remains free to prevent pricing as a barrier. Network effects and international expansion are prioritized over maximizing near-term revenues. This ensures massive scale that paves the way for multiple ancillary services and new earnings streams in future. While financial details remain undisclosed, monetization potentials are tremendous given the platforms' multi-billion user bases and engagement levels. Focusing on long-term value creation over profits guides their sustainable monetization approach.
