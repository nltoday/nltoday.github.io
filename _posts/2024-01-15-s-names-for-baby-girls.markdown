For parents wanting a nature-inspired name with an elegant ring, **Sienna** could be the perfect choice. Calling to mind the warm burnt orange-red hue, Sienna evokes imagery of the earth and natural beauty. Thought to possibly derive from an Italian city or word for "profound", Sienna also carries an air of mystique. Its unique sound and meaning sets this name apart from more common S names. 
### Royal Scarlett
Vibrant **Scarlett** conjures images of lush scarlet flowers or the rich color itself. Derived from Gaelic words meaning "red" or "crimson scarlet", Scarlett feels bold, fiery, and spirited. It also carries aristocratic history to it as the name of characters in novels like Gone with the Wind. For a daughter with personality and passion, regal Scarlett makes a gorgeous statement name.

One of the most darling diminutive S names is **Shelly**. A sweet nickname version of names like Michelle or Shelia, Shelly immediately evokes imagery of seashells, sunshine, and summer beaches. It brings to mind playful, happy vibes. While not heard as often as its parent names, Shelly maintains its youthful charm and makes a lovely middle name choice.

Its sing-song cadence gives it a fanciful fairy tale feel. 
### Gorgeous Sylvia 
Rooted in Latin for "woodland" or "forest", **Sylvia** evokes the beauty found in nature. Lush, leafy, and peaceful, Sylvia feels calming and grounded. Its soft "s" sound rolls off the tongue sweetly. Pronounced si-lee-vee-uh, its four syllables lend it a lyrical quality. Sylvia has a rarity to it yet remains recognizable, making it an undeniably gorgeous name choice.

For a daughter with a bit of mystical royalty, opt for **Selene**. In Greek mythology, Selene was considered the goddess of the moon. How enchanting is that? With origins in Greek for "moon", Selene takes on an ethereal lunar meaning. Its three syllables carry the grace and elegance of the moon herself. Timeless Selene would make the perfect name for your little princess.
