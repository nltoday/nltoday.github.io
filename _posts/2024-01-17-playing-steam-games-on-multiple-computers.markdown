### Connecting Your Accounts
In order to play your Steam games across multiple computers, you'll need to connect your Steam account to each device. This allows Steam to verify your game licenses and access your cloud saves. To get started, simply download and install the Steam client software on any computers you wish to play on. Then login with your Steam username and password. 
Steam utilizes your account to authenticate game ownership. **When you first launch a game on a new machine, it may need to briefly check online to verify the licensing is linked to your account.** From then on, you can play offline if needed since the initial authentication is saved locally. It's important only one device accesses your library at a time for security.

### Transferring Game Files
Once your account is connected, you have a few options for transferring game files between PCs. For smaller games, redownloading is usually quickest. But for large titles, moving the files can save bandwidth. **Steam makes this straightforward using the "Backup and Restore Games" feature in Settings.** Simply select the drives and folders, then copy everything over to the new system.
When you launch the game afterwards, Steam may need to verify a few files but most will already be present, speeding things up greatly versus a full redownload. An alternative is using an external hard drive to manually transfer install folders. Just be sure both computers can access the drive to locate and launch games.
### Accessing Saved Games
A key benefit of Steam is how it seamlessly syncs your progress between devices using Steam Cloud. **For titles with this functionality enabled, your saves will automatically upload to the servers as you play and download to new systems.** You can continue games exactly where you left off regardless of where you fire them up. 
Not all developers utilize Steam Cloud however. For those that don't, you'll need to manually copy the save files located within the game's install folder, usually under Documents or AppData. Finding and moving these ensures you don't lose your storyline or character progression when switching devices.
### Playing Games Simultaneously    
While Steam allows installing on numerous PCs, only one can actively play a game at a time with a single account. This restriction prevents sharing licenses against developers' wishes. **If you sign in elsewhere mid-session, the first device will be signed out and see the game as "currently running" until you quit.**
To play different Steam games concurrently, you need separate accounts with unique library ownership. Family sharing enables designating additional systems to access a limited subset of your library for offline single-user sessions. However live multiplayer across linked devices is prohibited for license purposes.
### Dealing with Multiplayer Sessions 
Coordinating move between PCs can be tricky for online multiplayer titles dependent on sessions remaining live. **Some games like Counter-Strike have ways to seamlessly pick up where you left off, but many will require restarting matchmaking.** 
Communication with teammates is important if temporarily swapping machines. Explain the situation beforehand if competitive ranking could be affected. During transition, make sure to fully quit the game rather than idling to prevent login errors or appearing AFK unintentionally. With care and coordination, seamless transitions are achievable even in online games on Steam.
### Overcoming Technical Hurdles
Most of the time, playing Steam games across PCs is simple. However some issues may arise requiring troubleshooting. Incompatible hardware, software conflicts, and network setups introduce potential glitches. **Always ensure drivers and Steam itself are fully up to date as updates patch bugs and add functionality.** 
If Cloud saves won't sync as expected, try changing sync settings or verifying Steam downloads file integrity. Having Steam libraries on different drives or partitions sometimes leads to file lookup errors at launch as well. Reinstalling games in the default Steam library location may resolve it. Overall, Steam aims to perfect cross-device compatibility - but testing for fit is prudent early on.
