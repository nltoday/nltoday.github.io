**How Smart Parents Can Save Big on Strollers, Car Seats, and More**  
### Online Marketplaces
There are many reputable online marketplaces where parents can find discounts on baby gear. Sites like Amazon, Walmart, and Target frequently run sales and promotions that make baby items more affordable. Accessories like bottles, clothes, and toys are commonly discounted the most. Prime Day, Black Friday, Cyber Monday and other annual sales events offer especially deep savings. It's always wise to compare prices across sites before checking out.

### Specialty Baby Stores
While prices may not always be the lowest, baby specialty retailers like BuyBuy Baby reward loyal customers. Membership programs provide access to exclusives like coupons, welcome gifts, and early access to sales. Brand sites like Graco and Chicco also provide discounts, loyalty points, and cashback offers. Remember to check the deals sections for [baby car seat deals](https://store.fi.io.vn/funny-chihuahuas-halloween-costume-witch-chihuahua-dog-lover-312-chihuahua-dog) and **travel system bundles**.
### Baby Registry Services
Completing a baby registry entitles parents to an array of perks beyond the traditional completion discount. Sites like Babylist offer cashback on purchases as well as price match guarantees. Amazon Baby Registry awards a $35 completion bonus that can be used on any baby products. Be sure to compare completion gifts across services to maximize value.  
### Used and Refurbished Gear
For significant savings, consider gently used or refurbished **baby gear**, especially for items like cribs, swings and bouncers that see limited use. Local apps like Facebook Marketplace offer convenience while buy-and-sell sites like Mercari provide buyer protections. Manufacturer certified refurbished equipment undergoes rigorous quality checks.
### Deals Comparison Sites 
Aggregator websites continuously scan retailer sites for coupons and promo codes on baby products. Sites like RetailMeNot and Coupons.com allow effortless price matching from a single interface. Mobile apps Honey and ShopSavvy automatically apply available discounts at checkout. Be sure to use cashback browsing extensions like Rakuten too for additional nested savings.
### Subscription Boxes
Monthly subscriptions introduce variety while providing members-only perks. Diaper subscriptions auto-deliver savings through volume discounts. Baby boxes introduce curated new items each month alongside bonus points towards future purchases. Look for introductory free trial periods and gift with purchase deals. 
### eBay Outlet Stores
Outlet storefronts on eBay offer heavy discounts, sometimes upwards of 70%, on returned, open-box or refurbished items that don't compromise quality or safety standards. Top-rated stores qualify purchases for free shipping and returns. Search by brand for popular gear from Graco, Chicco, and more. Outlets extend the lifespan of quality products at budget prices.
### Facebook Parenting Groups  
Online parenting communities serve as hubs for local deals, hand-me-downs, and group purchases. Regional buy-nothing Facebook groups offer free gear while parents' resell groups facilitate upcycling. Bargain hunters regularly share promo codes, clearance sales alerts, and discount stacking tips exclusively for group members.
