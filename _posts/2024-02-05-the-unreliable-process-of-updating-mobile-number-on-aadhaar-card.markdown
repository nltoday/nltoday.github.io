Updating personal details like phone number on Aadhaar card is essential for many but the process seems unreliable and inefficient according to user experiences. Let's take a deeper look into this important issue.
### Frustration with Long Waiting Periods   
Applying for an update on 26th December, it has been over a month and the Aadhaar details are still not updated. When contacting the customer support, they tell users to remain patient and that it can take 60 to 90 days for the update to be reflected. This long waiting period is unacceptable considering it is an important government issued ID document and delays can impact people's livelihood and opportunities. 
Users don't understand why the verification and updating process has to take so long, [especially for minor changes like mobile number updates](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/ake) that don't require extensive verification. Rejecting requests outright if there are issues would be preferable to keeping users hanging without any updates for 1.5 months. The lack of transparency around timelines and status updates adds to the frustration.

### Inaccurate Status Tracking 
Another user tried to update their new phone number offline in September but when tracking the status online, it showed an incorrect request number. Multiple calls to the customer support yielded conflicting information, first telling the user to wait 90 days and then saying the request was cancelled due to a technical issue. Such inconsistencies raise doubts about the reliability of the updating system and status tracking abilities. 
Users end up helpless without a way to accurately check the progress of their request. They are also left questioning if the prolonged timelines quoted to them are realistic or ways to defer responsibility. Clear communication and a robust status tracking platform is crucial to build trust inUIDAI's service quality.
### Sudden and Unexpected Completion
In a similar case, a user's number update got approved unexpectedly after 3 weeks of applying, with no communication in between. They contacted customer support multiple times only to be told to remain patient without any estimated timeframe. This leaves users in the dark about the true status and wondering if quoted timelines are just placeholder responses. 
Sudden completion without updates also means people cannot plan around the expected timeline, like making alternate arrangements if updates are delayed beyond a certain point. The lack of transparency around processing leaves a lot to be desired from what is supposed to be an important digital identity system serving over a billion Indians.
### Inconsistency in Customer Support Responses  
Interacting with the Aadhaar customer support yielded further inconsistent and unhelpful responses for one user. When they called regarding their long pending update, they were first told it may take 90 days but then informed the request was cancelled due to a technical issue. Such conflicting replies indicate a lack of proper tracking of requests and coordination between customer facing teams.
Users are just left more confused by contradictory information from the official support channels. It damages the credibility of UIDAI and trust in their ability to reliably service requests and keep track of updates. Uniform training of frontline staff and updated internal records are critical to provide consistent and accurate support to residents.
### Impact on Livelihood and Opportunities
For many users, a functioning Aadhaar is essential to their livelihood and opportunities. One user highlighted how their job offer was contingent on having a working Aadhaar with the correct mobile number within 4 days. Delays and uncertain timelines in processing updates can thus directly impact people's careers and means of sustaining themselves. 
Long pending changes leave users helpless in such urgent situations through no fault of their own. **The massive "Aadhaar ecosystem" built around this digital ID needs to factor in scenarios where people's access to benefits, scholarships and more depends on Aadhaar being up to date.** Faster resolution of issues is critical instead of ambiguous responses that offer no solution.
### Lack of Transparency on Technical Issues
In one case, the customer support told the user their request was cancelled due to a "technical glitch". However, there was no transparency on what actually went wrong or efforts to fix such issues to avoid repetitive failures. 
Systemic problems need to be acknowledged and resolved proactively rather than inconveniencing users. Periodic communication about known technical limitations and a mechanism to escalate recurring problems would help improve public faith. Silence and passing the buck does little to address the root causes of unreliable performance.
### Suggestions for Improving the Process 
To summarize the core pain-points, the Aadhaar number update process lacks transparency, has uncertain timelines, inconsistent customer support, and technical limitations that directly impact people. 
Some recommendations for UIDAI include:
- Establish **clear and realistic standard processing timelines** for common requests
- Provide **real-time status updates** and tracking of applications 
- Train frontline staff to give **consistent and accurate responses**
- Institute **problem escalation mechanisms** to fix systemic issues
- Proactively communicate about **known technical limitations**
- Consider reviewing policies for **urgent situations affecting livelihoods**
Implementing these suggestions can help rebuild public trust by establishing more reliable, transparent and people-centric systems. A properly functioning Aadhaar platform is crucial for millions of residents in India.
