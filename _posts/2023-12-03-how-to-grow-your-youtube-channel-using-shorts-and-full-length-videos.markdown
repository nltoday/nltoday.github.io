Short video content on YouTube, commonly known as YouTube Shorts, has become hugely popular in recent times. As a new creator, it is one of the best ways to quickly gain popularity and attract more subscribers to your channel. However, relying solely on shorts is not enough for sustainable growth. In this article, we will discuss an effective strategy to leverage both shorts and full-length videos to grow your YouTube channel organically.
## Leveraging **Short Form Content** for Rapid Discovery  
YouTube Shorts offers an easy way to create and share short entertaining or informative clips in a vertical full-screen format. Due to their short viewing time, shorts are well-suited for quick discovery and are prominently featured on the YouTube homepage and inside the YouTube app. As a new creator, you should focus on creating fun and **engaging short video clips** from your longer videos. You can take clips of interesting gameplay moments, highlights from vlogs, tutorials etc and post them as shorts. Be sure to include a **call to action** in the shorts inviting viewers to check out your full video for more context. This will help drive traffic to your main videos and channel. You should aim to post 1-2 shorts per day initially for rapid discovery and growth.
## Providing **Full Length Video Context** 
While shorts are great for discovery, **watch time metrics** come mainly from longer format videos. To sustain viewer engagement and better monetization opportunities, you need full length videos on your channel along with the shorts. The full videos provide necessary context and storyline that short clips cannot. In your shorts, directly mention and link to the specific full length video that the clip was taken from. Over time, as your shorts bring in new viewers, the full videos will help **retain** them on your channel for longer watch sessions. Aim to post at least 1 high-quality full length video per week relevant to your niche along with the daily shorts.
## Optimizing for **Search and Discovery**
To get discovered beyond just the homepage and app, your short and long form content also needs to be optimized for search. Include 2-3 relevant **keywords or key phrases** in the title, description and tags of both shorts and full videos. The keywords should reflect intent of viewers searching in your niche. For example, for a "Fortnite gameplay" channel, keywords could be "**Fortnite Battle Royale tips**, **Fortnite weapon guide**, **Fortnite best landing spots** etc". Be consistent with your keyword strategy across all videos. This will help rank your content higher in search and suggested videos for improved discovery over the long run. 
## Measuring **Engagement Metrics** 
As a new creator, closely monitoring key metrics like average watch time, like-to-dislike ratio, comments and shares can provide valuable insights into viewer engagement and feedback. Videos with higher engagement should be built upon while sub-par performing ones require improvement. Additionally, videos driving most new subscribers also indicate content themes resonating best with your target audience. Regularly analyzing performance reports in YouTube Studio will help fine tune your **video strategy, titles and descriptions** for optimum results. With consistent effort posting high-quality content in both short and long formats, optimized for search and discovery, your channel is bound to grow organically over months.
## Improving Content and Production Quality
As your channel starts gaining traction, it is important to focus on continually **improving the production quality and value** of your videos. Small tweaks like better lighting, audio quality, editing etc can enhance viewer experience multifold. You may also consider upgrading equipment over time. On the content side, learn from community feedback and test different styles, ideas and formats to engage viewers better. Collaborate with other creators in your niche for **cross-promotional opportunities** as the channel scale increases. Keep experimenting and evolving based on analytics to **deliver exceptional value to your growing audience**. This will help boost viewer retention, subscriber loyalty and discovery on YouTube in the long run.
## Monetization and Diversification
Once your channel crosses the eligibility thresholds for monetization programs like YouTube Partner Program, you can integrate options like Super Chat, Super Stickers, Memberships to generate alternate **revenue streams on top of ad revenue**. As the reach expands further, explore diversifying your content across other platforms and mediums based on their unique opportunities. For example, creating **long-format video courses or guides**, writing blogs, conducting paid training workshops in your niche. This will make your content and brand sustainable beyond just YouTube as a creator. Regularly assessing growth metrics and viewership patterns will help strategize the right time for such diversification steps.
## Building a Loyal Community
True success on YouTube comes from developing a highly engaged community around your channel and brand over years. Consistent effort should be made right from the beginning to foster two-way interactions, build familiarity and provide value to the community. This includes responding to comments promptly, utilizing channel membership features, hosting giveaways, being available on related communities and taking feedback gracefully. Significant community support will lead to die-hard fans promoting the channel organically through shares and word-of-mouth. Nurturing a strong community with a personal connection should remain a key long-term focus area for steady growth of the YouTube journey.
In summary, leveraging both short and long form video formats in a strategic manner, backed by regular analytics review and action, community building, and production quality improvements can help any new YouTube creator grow their channel successfully over months and years. Consistency is key to organic discovery and retention on the platform through this approach.
