### Understanding Reels  
Instagram Reels is Instagram's version of short-form vertical video content, similar to TikTok. It allows users to create and share 15-second multi-clip videos with audio, effects, and tools for creating engaging content. Reels aims to attract younger audiences who are active on TikTok by offering short-form video creation and sharing features. While Reels is still in its early days on Instagram, it has the potential to help creators boost their reach if used strategically.

### Accessing Reels on Your Profile
To access Reels on your Instagram profile and begin creating content, follow these simple steps:
1. Tap on your profile image in the lower right corner to access your profile. 
2. From anywhere within the Instagram Feed, swipe right or tap at the top of the screen to navigate to your profile. 
3. Scroll all the way to the bottom of your profile screen and you should see the Reels section. Tap on it to get started with Reels on your profile.
### Creating and Sharing Reels Content
Once you access Reels, you can create new videos for Instagram Reels or upload existing short videos from your gallery. You can apply filters, audio tracks, timers and other creative tools. When ready, tap share to your feed. Alternatively, you can create a draft privately and schedule it to be posted at a later time. 
While creating **short-form vertical video content**, consider including trending sounds, using creative editing techniques like transitions, text overlays etc. This will help capture viewer attention within the 15 second timeframe. You can also feature popular hashtags in your reels to reach wider audiences. Tagging other creators is another way to get your reel in front of new eyeballs. 
Once posted, your reel will appear in the Reels tab of followers and be eligible to reach the broader Explore page based on engagement. Ensure your reels match viewers' interests through compelling storytelling in a short snappy format. This will increase chances of users stopping to watch the full duration.
### Understanding Reels Discovery 
Beyond your followers, discovering new reels happens through Instagram's **"bold vertical video content"** and hashtags pages. Your reel may appear in the top reels carousel if it gets high video views, likes or shares within the first 2-3 hours. Subsequent discovery depends on how engaging your reel is and whether viewers stop midway or watch until completion. 
Factors like music selection, editing style and ability to capture attention quickly impact a reel's performance. Try experimenting with different types of creative reels aligned to your niche or brand. Over time, consistently publishing high-quality reels could potentially earn you new followers leading to higher visibility through Instagram algorithms.
### Tips for Success with Reels
To make the most of Instagram Reels for your business or profile, focus on the following best practices:
- Use trending in-app stickers, GIFs and filters to make your reels stand out 
- Incorporate trending sounds or popular songs into your videos
- Feature relevant hashtags in each reel to reach related audiences
- Cross-promote new reels across other social networks 
- Engage with followers through comments on their reels 
- Analyze metrics to understand what types of reels perform better
- Be consistent with publishing frequent, high-quality reel content  
- Experiment with different types of videos aligned to your niche
