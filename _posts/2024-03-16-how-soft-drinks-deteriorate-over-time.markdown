### Changes Happen Gradually
Soft drinks like Coke undergo gradual changes as they sit on shelves and in fridges over time. Three main things occur - the carbonation dissipates, artificial sweeteners lose potency, and caramel color fades. This erosion process happens faster for bottles exposed to sunlight compared to cans. Expiration dates aim to ensure products remain enjoyable before noticeable deterioration sets in.

### Carbonation is Lost
One of the first things people notice is soft drinks going "flat" due to [lost carbonation](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-santa-christmas-tree-lights-funny-xmas-pajama-boys-426-chihuahua-dog). Carbonation, the dissolved carbon dioxide gas that gives drinks their fizz, escapes the liquid over time unsealed at room temperature. Proper sealing in bottles or cans slows this process, but it's unavoidable. The longer drinks sit, the more bubbly carbonation dissipates, changing the taste profile.
### Artificial Sweeteners Lose Impact 
In **diet soft drinks**, artificial sweeteners such as aspartame and acesulfame potassium are used in place of sugar. However, these intense sweeteners gradually **lose potency** with age. As they break down, the perception of sweetness fades, throwing off the flavor balance diet drinks aim to achieve. Over time, they taste less and less sweet compared to when fresh.
### Color Fades Under Light
Soft drinks are **visually appealing** thanks to caramel color added to imitate the look of colas. But light exposure causes this pigment to slowly **fade away** over shelves and in bottles, leading the beverage to appear more transparent and diluted. Cans block this degradation, keeping color intact much longer than sun-exposed plastic or glass bottles.
### Impacts of Containers
**Plastic linings** in cans and plastic bottles themselves introduce another variable. As plastic polymers break down over time and temperatures fluctuate, trace chemicals may **leach into drinks**. While unlikely to cause harm, it can impact the taste. Glass resists this degradation but is costly. Properly sealed containers minimize effects of materials on long-term drink quality. 
### Past Best Before Still Safe
Soft drink **expiration dates aim for noticeable quality**, not microbial risks. Unless contaminated, expired drinks pose negligible health hazards due to high acidity and lack of nutrients. Having an **"off" flavor** is generally the worst consequence of consumption past best before dates. While taste may suffer more with age, safety isn't a major concern within reasonable timeframes after dating.
### Judging Aging Effects
There's no fixed threshold where drinks suddenly become unacceptable overnight. The further past dates, the higher chance of undesirable changes. But occasional post-date consumption usually won't cause issues. It takes experiencing deterioration firsthand in gradually aging products to assess individual thresholds and storage variables that impact quality over long-term shelf lives.
### In Summary
A complex web of chemical, physical and biological factors govern how carbonated soft drinks change gradually **over extended periods shelved or refrigerated.** Understanding these deterioration drivers provides context for best-before dates and realizes their purpose is preserving quality - not implying imminent hazards once surpassed, so moderate post-date consumption isn't inherently risky.
