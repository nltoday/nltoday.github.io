### Reels Addiction
When Instagram introduced the reels feature, many creators started sharing entertaining and engaging content on the platform which led to increasing reels on feeds. I also enjoyed watching reels initially but soon became addicted to them. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't stop mindlessly scrolling through reels for hours.

### Downloading Old Instagram Version 
After struggling with reels addiction for a long time, I finally found a solution. I downloaded an older version of the Instagram app from before reels were introduced. With the old app version, I no longer had access to the reels feature and was able to enjoy Instagram like I used to. While this meant I couldn't see if any friends shared reels with me, it helped me break free of the reels habit.
### Using a Clone App for Viewing Friends' Reels
To still be able to view any reels my friends might share with me, I installed a clone Instagram app which had the updated reels functionality. This way, I could open the clone app only when someone sends me a reel to view it and still engage with their content without being exposed to endless reels on my feed all the time. 
### Manually Deleting Individual Reels
For removing reels you've already shared to your Instagram profile, there is an option to manually delete them one by one. From your profile, tap the three horizontal lines icon in the top right corner and select 'Your Activity'. Then choose 'Reels' followed by 'Photos and Videos' to access all your shared reels. You can then select the three dot menu on any reel and tap 'Delete' to remove it from your profile.
### Archiving Reels For Temporary Hiding   
If you only want to hide a reel temporarily without fully deleting it, you have the option to archive posts instead. Archiving a reel will remove it from your profile feed but keep it in your archived posts. To do this, follow the same steps of accessing your reels from 'Your Activity', then select the three dot menu and tap 'Archive' rather than delete. Later, you can unarchive to make the reel visible on your profile again.
### Bulk Reel Deletion With Filtering By Date 
For [bulk deleting multiple reels](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-doberman-dog-face-pup-pet-puppy-lover-best-dad-mom-ever-v-neck-t-shirt/women&) at once instead of one by one, you can filter by date to select ranges of older reels for removal. From your activity page, choose the three line icon again and select 'Posts' instead of reels. Then use the date filters to narrow down to a specific time period containing the reels you wish to delete. Select all those reels together and tap 'Delete' for bulk removal. 
### Deactivating Account For Complete Content Wipe
The most extensive way to remove all your reels and content from Instagram is by fully deactivating your account. Beware that deactivating is permanent and your username may become available for others to claim once you do this. All your followers, likes, messages, and shared content will be permanently removed from Instagram. 
### Finding Balance With Reels
While removing reels can be beneficial in some cases, it's also important to find balance. Reels provide value and entertainment when used moderately. The key is learning when reels stop being enjoyable and become more of an addiction or distraction. With mindful consumption of engaging but not excessive reels, the feature can still be part of a healthy Instagram experience.
