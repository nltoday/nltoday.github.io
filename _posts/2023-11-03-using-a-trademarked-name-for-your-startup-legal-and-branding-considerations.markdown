### Trademark Law Basics
When starting a new business, coming up with the perfect name is an important decision that will impact your branding for years to come. However, choosing a name that belongs to an existing trademark holder can land you in legal trouble. Here are some basics about trademark law to keep in mind:
Trademarks protect names, logos, slogans, and other branding elements associated with a particular product or company. Trademark owners have exclusive rights to use their marks in commerce and can prevent others from using confusingly similar marks. If your business name creates confusion with an existing trademark, you may receive a cease and desist letter or even be sued for infringement. 
[Registering your trademark is not required to gain rights](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-dad-daddy-owner-of-a-chihuahua-chihuahua-lover3736-t-shirt), but registration formalizes your claim and makes enforcing rights easier if issues arise later on. Common law rights also begin as soon as a mark is used in commerce for a particular good or service. Do diligence checks for similar marks before adopting a new business name to avoid potential conflicts.

### Using another's Pokémon Inspired Name 
The Pokémon franchise owns registered trademarks for many well-known character names like **Pikachu** and **Charizard**. Using one of these unique invented names for your own business would likely constitute infringement. 
However, names inspired by regular words or mythology may have a stronger fair use argument. For example, a company named **SlowpokeMoves** focused on slow and steady delivery services could try to argue the Pokémon reference is merely descriptive rather than as a brand identifier. Success would depend on analyzing likelihood of confusion factors.
Overall, the safest approach is to create your own original name rather than borrow elements from pop culture franchises you do not own. Determine if your intended use adds a sufficiently creative transformative element versus simply trading on fan recognition of the underlying intellectual property. Consult a trademark attorney if uncertainty remains.
### Evaluating Alternative Name Options
If concerns exist regarding your first choice name, it's wise to explore alternatives before launching your business. Brainstorming sessions can help spark new ideas to consider. 
### HelpDotCo 
One option raised is HelpDotCo as a name focused on using Braille dots to aid others. This name is original and self-explanatory regarding business services while avoiding trademark issues. It clearly distinguishes the brand versus associating with a separate well-known property. 
Names like **GuidingSymbols** or **TactileAssist** could also work depending on the specific services offered. The goal is finding an identifier that succinctly conveys your mission in an interesting way without borrowing elements from works you do not own the rights to exploit.
### Conducting Clearing Searches
Before settling on any new name potential, thorough trademark searches are necessary. While not definitive, search results provide valuable guidance on the availability and strength of similar marks. Consult search reports when:
- Finalizing your business name selection   
- During the naming phase to evaluate alternatives
- Prior to any marketing or branding rollout
Comprehensive searches examine federal, state and common law rights. International options also exist if expanding globally. Focus searches on relevant industry classifications and geographic areas of intended use. Remember - selection the clearest name available reduces long term confusion risks.
### Choosing the Best Fit for your Brand
With various naming considerations in mind and potential options evaluated, carefully select the alternative that fits your business goals and values. Important factors include:
- Conveying intended services/mission in memorable way  
- Availability and strength of similar marks
- Scalability as company grows its offerings
- Alignment with target market and personality
While startups aim for attention-grabbing buzz, strategic branding strengthens as companies mature. Selecting a trademark-clear name establishing a distinct identity and vision lays the groundwork for sustainable long term growth. Proper due diligence upfront avoids costly issues down the road.
