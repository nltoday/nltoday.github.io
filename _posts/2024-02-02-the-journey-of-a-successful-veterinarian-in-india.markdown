### Overcoming Hardships and Pursuing His Passion 
My father always had a natural love and care for animals since a very young age. When the village veterinarian visited our home to treat our cattle, my father was in awe of the doctor's work and wanted to help sick animals just like him. However, life had many challenges for him. At the age of just 2, he lost his mother and during his 12th board exams, he sadly lost his father as well who was battling an illness. Even with these personal hardships, my father showed true grit and determination. While taking care of his ailing father, he somehow managed to pass his 12th exams privately with minimal studies and attendance.  
With no money for college fees, he worked hard in farms and fields to collect enough funds for his dream of pursuing a [veterinary medical degree](https://yt.io.vn/collection/abernethy). He applied to CCSHAU University and got selected. The years of struggling financially and overcoming deep personal losses had instilled in him strong willpower and dedication towards completing his education. Through **sheer hard work and perseverance**, he was able to graduate with a B.V.Sc degree despite all odds stacked against him.

### His Career Takes Off at CAZRI and NDRI 
My father's talent and skills were recognized when he got his first job posting at the Central Arid Zone Research Institute (CAZRI) in Jodhpur. There was only one vacancy at the time but he stood out among 11 other candidates and secured the position. During his three years there, he gained valuable experience treating livestock in the arid region. Next, he was transferred to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI/NDRI) campus in Karnal. This move marked a turning point in his career. 
At NDRI, he became a part of many pioneering research projects. Some key achievements included being a team member for the world's first buffalo cloning. He regularly performed embryo transfer procedures and became an expert in animal reproduction. My father also provided training to industrialists and foreign veterinarians visiting NDRI. His clinical and practical knowledge benefited many postgraduate students as well. Renowned for his skills and expertise, he was even called upon to treat cattle at Rashtrapati Bhavan.
### Gaining Widespread Recognition and A Successful Private Practice
Word of my father's impressive work soon spread far and wide. He began getting many invitations to visit other institutes and give expert guidance on advanced technologies like ovum pickup, in-vitro fertilization, and specialized animal treatment techniques. National television channel RSTV featured a segment on his career highlights and contributions to the field. 
After years of service with prominent government organizations, he decided to start an independent private veterinary practice as well. Leveraging his experience and network of industrial contacts, the clinic became very successful within a short time span. A growing clientele included large dairy farms and cattle owners who sought his **advanced reproductive services and medical consultation**. Even during his busy schedule, he makes it a priority to provide affordable treatment for village livestock whenever required. 
Through diligent service delivered with utmost care and compassion, my father has gained immense respect within the veterinary community. He is often invited as a chief guest or speaker at seminars and conferences due to his in-depth subject knowledge. Several veterinary students also intern at the clinic to learn from his clinical expertise and problem-solving abilities gained over decades of practice.
### Passionate Advancement of Veterinary Sciences 
Apart from his clinical engagements, my father has always strived to promote advancements within the field. He regularly publishes research papers on new techniques and breakthrough findings. Two of the papers co-authored by him have won national awards for best original work. Furthermore, he enthusiastically mentors and guides many younger generation veterinarians, encouraging them to pursue specializations and higher education.
To increase livestock farming skills and incomes of rural populations, my father organizes periodic free veterinary camps and **training programs on modern animal husbandry practices**. These empower villagers with knowledge on scientific dairy management, nutrition, disease diagnosis and prevention. He also advocates for policy level reforms and investments needed to strengthen India's animal healthcare infrastructure as well as the status and education of veterinarians nationwide.
Overall through perseverance, passion and lifelong dedication, my father has achieved great heights both professionally and personally. His inspiring rags-to-riches journey from difficult beginnings to becoming a renowned expert in his field showcases that with sustained effort and commitment, one can certainly have a successful career as a veterinarian in India as well.
