### Start of a Legendary Feud
Bette Davis was considered one of Hollywood's leading ladies in the 1940s, known for her intense and unforgettable performances in films such as All About Eve and What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?. However, the actress was also known to be fiercely competitive and took her rivalry with fellow actress Miriam Hopkins very seriously during the filming of their 1941 movie Old Acquaintance. Davis had immense disdain for Hopkins and enjoyed intensely playing the scene where her character grabs and shakes Hopkins' character, throwing her into a chair. According to Davis, she was "fascinated" watching Hopkins' acting tricks appear, one by one, such as her eyes wandering when she was supposed to be listening. Their intense animosity during filming helped create one of the most compelling on-screen dramatic moments in the film.

### Davis Takes Joy in Dominating Hopkins 
Bette Davis took pride in asserting her dominance over Miriam Hopkins during the production of Old Acquaintance. She relished physicality of the iconic scene where she grabs and shakes Hopkins, clearly establishing herself as the alpha actress on set. In interviews after filming, Davis would boast about outmaneuvering and outperforming Hopkins at every turn. While their intense performances helped elevate the drama of the film, behind the scenes it revealed the true bitter rivalry brewing between the two leading ladies. Davis knew all the tricks of Hopkins' trade and was not afraid to call her out, cementing her reputation as a ruthless competitor who left no stone unturned in besting her opponents.
### A Lifelong Feud is Cemented
The animosity between Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins did not end after they finished filming Old Acquaintance. Davis would continue taking shots at Hopkins for decades to come. In interviews late in life, the only nice thing Davis would say about Hopkins was that "she is a good actress but otherwise a real bitch." This cemented Hopkins' reputation as one of Davis' most hated rivals. Their feud epitomized the cutthroat competition between actresses in Hollywood's golden age. Even long after Hopkins' death in 1972, Davis maintained her disdain, ensuring her rivalry with Hopkins lived on in Hollywood legend and lore.
### Davis vs. Crawford: Another Notorious Rivalry 
While Bette Davis' feud with Miriam Hopkins was one for the ages, she also engaged in another legendary rivalry, this time with actress Joan Crawford. In the early 1930s, both Davis and Crawford were rising stars vying for the same prestigious roles in Hollywood. Their competition intensified when Crawford married Franchot Tone, Davis' former love interest. On the set of their 1962 film What Ever Happened to Baby Jane, the long-simmering tension between the two exploded. Clashes over acting styles and personal differences made the already tortured on-screen sister relationship a reality. Their real-life feud stole the spotlight and added fuel to their status as rivals until the end of their careers.
### Mother Knows Best: Crawford's Parenting mirrored her Public Persona
Joan Crawford's legendary status as a ferocious competitor was also reflected in her parenting skills, or lack thereof. Her daughter Christina Crawford's memoir "Mommie Dearest" painted a grim picture of Joan's obsessive control and physical abuse behind closed doors. According to her daughter, living with Crawford was like "living in fear of a violent outburst", with "constant belittling" part of their daily life. When Joan was in a good mood, she could be caring - but in her dark moments, she was like a "tasmanian devil". For her children, Joan's private persona matched the cutthroat public image she cultivated as a fellow rival of Bette Davis. Her toxic parenting was a direct result of the hardened competitiveness that defined her career.
### Legacies of Competition and Catfights  
The legendary rivalries of Bette Davis, Joan Crawford and Miriam Hopkins helped cement their status as some of Hollywood's fiercest actresses. However, their intensely competitive natures did not merely play out on screen - they damaged personal relationships and haunted their reputations for life. While their unforgettable performances continue to enthrall audiences today, behind the scenes stories of manipulation, temper tantrums and catfights also solidified their legacies. Even decades later, their fierce determination to be the best came at great emotional cost, shadowing careers hard-won in the cutthroat world of golden-age Hollywood. Their notorious feuds demonstrate how professional competitiveness can transform relationships and lives, for better or worse.
