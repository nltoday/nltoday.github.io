### [Following Through On Your Commitments Is Essential For Success](https://store.fi.io.vn/french-bulldog-frenchie-dog-black-dog-lover-frenchies-1)
As I started high school, I had been slacking off in middle school. My grades were decent but not as good as they used to be. On the way to drop me off for my first day of high school, my dad gave me some advice that really stuck with me. He said "Middle school doesn't count for anything. This year counts. This year determines your future. What colleges you can get into, what kind of an education you get. Do well." His words reminded me that high school was important and that I needed to follow through on my commitments if I wanted to be successful in the future. From that point on, I put in more effort with my schoolwork and took my studies more seriously. I'm glad I listened to my dad's advice, as it helped put me on the right path.

### **The Value Of "Fake It Till You Make It" In Building Confidence** 
In college, I had an English professor who gave some invaluable advice - "Confidence is perceived, sometimes you have to act like you know what you're doing and just fake it till you make it." At the time, I was feeling uncertain about my abilities. But her words reminded me that projecting confidence, even if you don't feel it internally, can help you succeed. Since then, I've applied the "fake it till you make it" mindset in many areas of my life, from job interviews to public speaking. Even when I'm feeling insecure, acting confident helps boost my own self-belief over time. It's allowed me to take on challenges I otherwise wouldn't have and has served as a great confidence-building strategy. Her advice to "fake it till you make it" has truly gotten me through so many difficult situations.
### **Understanding That You Can't Please Everyone Is Liberating**
One saying that was extremely liberating for me was "No matter what you do in life, one third of people around you are going to love you, another third - hate you, and the rest - just plain don't care about you." Realizing this important truth allowed me to stop worrying so much about needing everyone's approval. I used to hesitate pursuing my dreams and ambitions because I was afraid of potential criticism or judgment from others. But once I accepted the fact that no matter what path I take in life, there will always be detractors, it freed me up to start living more authentically according to my own values and goals. Now I'm not afraid to put myself out there, knowing I can't please everyone anyway. This simple phrase helped me gain so much confidence in **following my passions** and **pursuing my true calling**, instead of worrying constantly about other people's opinions of me.
### **The Importance Of Motivation And Self-Determination** 
In middle school, I had become distracted and started slacking off in my studies due to a lack of motivation. Playing video games and watching movies was just more fun than doing homework or studying. But when my dad reminded me that high school was important and would impact my future, it **reignited my motivation** and self-determination. I wanted to prove to myself that I could succeed and get into a good college. Having that sense of purpose and understanding the real-world consequences of my actions spurred me to make positive changes. This experience taught me that motivation doesn't just come from within - important people in our lives can also light a fire under us to **achieve our highest potential** through their encouragement and advice. Their guidance helped me find my "why" and rediscover the drive to pursue excellence.
### **Developing Confidence Through Consistent Action**
While the "fake it till you make it" advice gave me a framework for building confidence through acting the part, it was through consistent effort and follow-through that I truly developed self-assurance. In high school, I made sure to always complete my assignments and study diligently for every test. My strong work ethic paid off as my grades improved steadily. In job interviews, I carried myself confidently but also delivered on the responsibilities of each role I accepted. Over time, proving to myself and others that I had the skills and determination to succeed in varied situations naturally boosted my confidence from within. Now, I approach everything from public speaking gigs to leadership opportunities with self-belief because I've trained myself through concrete action to develop competence. For anyone lacking confidence, I believe the real secret is to let your abilities shine through with diligent practice and perseverance.
### **Embracing Individuality By Ignoring Critics** 
For a long time, I wondered what others thought of me and tried to please everyone, which held me back from pursuing many interests wholeheartedly. But realizing that it's impossible to get universal approval freed me to embrace my unique talents and ideas without fear. Now I have the courage to take on creative projects that feel meaningful to me, whether they achieve mainstream success or generate controversy, because I know I can't control how others react. This mindset has helped me build a career doing work I'm passionate about instead of compromising to conform to popular opinion. Living authentically according to your own values, despite naysayers, is so important for individual growth and fulfillment. I'm grateful advice reminding me that others' judgments are out of my control set me on a path of self-discovery and fulfilling my potential unapologetically.
### **Concluding Thoughts**
The guidance I received from loved ones and mentors over the years has undoubtedly shaped my life perspective and success. Hearing nuggets of wisdom like "fake it till you make it," the importance of follow-through, and that I can't please everyone has allowed me to overcome self-doubt, pursue opportunities wholeheartedly and stay true to myself. I hope sharing these impactful pieces of advice I received will also motivate and inspire readers to trust in their abilities, stay determined in achieving goals and embrace living boldly unhindered by others' opinions. Valuable advice doesn't necessarily come from experts, but often from those closest to us. I'm grateful for those who took the time to provide perspective shifting words that have served me so well.
