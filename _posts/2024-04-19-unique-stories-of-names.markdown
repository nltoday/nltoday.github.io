### A Tribute Through Language 
Another family crafted a name to represent their heritage through the native language. **Anubhansoo Runsoo's name originates from his parents' names in Hindi.** His mother's name **Anubha** means lightning, so he received **Ansh** meaning part. Likewise, his father **Rudra** refers to the Hindu god Shiva, so he was given **Runsoo** as a variation of **Rudransoo**. **This thoughtful naming honored both parents while giving him a connection to their culture wherever he goes**.
