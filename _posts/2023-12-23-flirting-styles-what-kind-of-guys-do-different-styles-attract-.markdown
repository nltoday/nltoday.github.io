Comedic flair attracts, but endless jokes divert from learning another. Mixing serious dialog provides perspective on values and priorities. Compatible partners appreciate lightness and depth equally. Gauge reactions and reciprocate levels of disclosure and seriousness accordingly. Relationships thrive on mutual understanding - an elusive goal without baring some souls beyond shallow views. Flirt styles working this balance find ties serving both lightness of spirit and depth of connection.
