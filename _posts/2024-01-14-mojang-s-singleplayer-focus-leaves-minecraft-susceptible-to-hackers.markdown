### Lack of Centralized Server Ownership
Unlike games such as Counter-Strike and League of Legends where the developers own the servers, Minecraft server ownership is decentralized with third-party owners. [Valve and Riot Games](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-autumn-fall-pumpkin-truck-mappe-thanksgiving324-chihuahua-dog) properly administer servers and ban hackers under their ownership. However, **Mojang does not own Minecraft servers** and thus does not have direct control over server administration and moderation. 
This distributed server model means **Mojang has little incentive to invest heavily in anti-cheat resources** since they do not directly benefit from policing individual servers. Their focus remains on the **core single-player experience** they provide rather than facilitating multiplayer. Server owners are left to supplement any deficiencies in **Minecraft's native anti-cheat capabilities**.

### Mojang's Attitude Enables Rampant Cheating
Mojang's view that **players only cheat themselves in single-player** translates to a hands-off approach to **multiplayer moderation as well**. They seem to believe issues around **hacking and cheating are for server owners to address** rather than problems requiring their direct involvement. 
However, this outlook ignores how easy it is for **cheaters to disrupt other players' experiences**. A single **script kiddie can wreak havoc on an entire server** with basic hacks like invisibility or speed modifications. Continual cheating **ruins the fun for legitimate players** and drives them away, hurting server communities.
### Hackers Proliferate with Few Consequences  
The **lack of centralized banning** further enables repeat offenses by hackers. Getting banned on one server is meaningless since cheaters can simply hop to another one without penalty. Few servers participate in **shared ban lists** like MCBans to coordinate bans across different communities.
This revolving door approach means there is **little actual risk of facing repercussions** no matter how many servers a cheater ruins. The lack of coordinated banning power **incentivizes cheating** by reducing the consequences. Hackers can engage in trial-and-error to find servers with lax moderation or anticheat systems to exploit.
### More Robust Plugins Provide Possible Solutions
While Mojang may not directly address anti-cheat, server owners can supplement the game through **plugins that randomize block data** rather than simply transmit all available information. Doing so would **break basic cheats like invisibility** since the client's view of unobserved blocks would no longer match reality.  
Plugins can also implement **more robust anticheat detection** through mechanisms like stat tracking to flag abnormal player behavior. Systems that **analyze stored gameplay data** for traces of exploits or modifications post-game would also help catch sophisticated cheaters. 
By **standardizing these types of advanced plugin features**, Mojang could facilitate **a integrated banning network across servers**. Individual communities would still own and operate their own spaces but benefit from **synchronized ban enforcement at scale**. Such cooperation **presents the best hopes for meaningfully addressing hacking at the multiplayer level**.
### Singleplayer Focus Limits What Mojang Can Do Alone  
While increased engagement with multiplayer issues would benefit players, Mojang's resources are ultimately best spent **prioritizing the game's core experiences they directly design**. As an **independent studio**, they must focus on **areas where their work has clearest returns**.
Policing individual community servers falls outside Mojang's direct sphere of influence or business interests given their **studio size and ownership model**. However, **providing support and guidelines** for tackling cheaters could go far even without direct intervention. Enabling server plugins and banning coordination presents an **impactful yet feasible role** for Mojang to play.
Their **single-player focus shaped Minecraft's open-ended development** which later facilitated a thriving mod and server community. With continued support, these communities can hopefully address hacking issues **that fall outside Mojang's intended scope as game-makers**. Leveraging player innovation remains the best path forward for **Minecraft's future as a hacker-free multiplayer experience.**
