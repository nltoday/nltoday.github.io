### Target the Right Keywords
When optimizing videos for YouTube, focusing on the right keywords is crucial. Choose [longtail keywords](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/acuff) related to your niche that have low competition but decent search volumes. Include both the primary keyword and related secondary keywords in the title, description, and tags. Optimize each video around 3-5 keywords.
YouTube's search and recommendation algorithms favor videos that are relevant to what users search for. By targeting the right keywords that your target audience is actively searching, you increase the chances of your video showing up in search results and getting recommended to similar viewers.

### Optimize Video Titles and Descriptions 
Your video title and description are like headlines - they should intrigue and inform potential viewers about what the video is about. Include your target keywords, but be concise. 
Titles needs to be 5-10 words with target keyword at the beginning. Descriptions should be 1-2 paragraphs summarizing what viewers will learn without giving everything away. You can also include relevant **longtail keywords**, calls to action to subscribe, and external links here. Proper title and description optimization are essential for video discoverability and click-through on YouTube.
### Create Engaging Thumbnails
A video thumbnail is the first impression viewers have of your video. It needs to immediately communicate what the video is about and entice people to click play. Highlight your target keyword and include relevant imagery in your thumbnails. 
Use images that pop without being too cluttered. Keep text brief and impactful. Test different thumbnail designs and images to see which resonates best with your audience. Quality thumbnails that represents the video content well are a great way to boost average view duration and click-through rate. 
### Add Useful End Screens 
The end screen is a feature displayed at the end of watch time that allows you to suggest additional content for viewers. Linking to other relevant videos, playlists or your channel helps keep viewers engaged on your channel longer. 
Some creative ways to utilize end screens include recommending what to watch next, suggesting to subscribe, linking to a playlist of similar videos, or providing a call to action. Try different combinations to see what performs best for your channel. Leveraging end screens is a simple yet effective way to boost overall views and watch time.
### Post Consistently 
One of the key factors that influence YouTube's algorithm is freshness of content. Posting videos regularly (weekly or bi-weekly) teaches the algorithm that your channel is active. It also keeps existing subscribers engaged and attracts new viewers. 
While quality should never be compromised, prioritize consistency over perfection when first starting out. Even if it's just one video a week, consistent uploads signal to YouTube that your channel deserves attention. With time as your library grows, focus on optimizing individual videos and increasing production value. But stay faithful to your schedule to keep growing.
### Engage with Your Audience
Engagement is extremely important for YouTube as it indicates to the algorithm what types of videos keep viewers interested. Focus on meaningful interactions like responding to comments, comments on other creator's videos, and engaging with your community on other social channels.
Also encourage current viewers to like, share and comment on videos. Their positive engagement will convince YouTube that your content is worth recommending. Even simple gestures like thanking people for subscribing or leaving feedback promotes interaction. Engaged communities often result in increased viewership and watchtime over time.
### Consider Alternative Platform Promotion
While YouTube should be your primary distribution channel, promoting your videos on alternative platforms can expose your content to wider audiences and drive more traffic back to YouTube. 
Sites like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn and even your email list allows you to widen your reach. Use teaser clips, images and links to entice people to watch full videos on YouTube. Just be mindful not to post full videos elsewhere due to copyright risks. Multichannel promotion effectively amplifies discovery without competing with your core YouTube efforts.
### Optimize Video Metadata 
Your title, description, tags and category are what YouTube indexes and understands your video content. Use relevant tags and optimize for your target primary and secondary keywords. Include important details in the Description to provide context without being too wordy. 
Place tags at the beginning and end of your description, with commas separating individual tags. YouTube recognizes up to 500 characters for tags so utilize them fully but avoid irrelevant or nonsense tags. Metadata optimization signals relevance to search engines and users while helping discoverability across different devices.
### Monitor Insights and Improve
YouTube Analytics provides valuable insights into how viewers interact with your videos. Pay attention to metrics like average view duration, retention, shares, likes, comments and demographics. They reveal what captivates audiences and what misses the mark. 
Use the information to identify weak spots to strengthen - whether its editing, content, or distribution strategy. test new thumbnail designs, hooks, calls to action etc. Always be experimenting yet learning from failures. Continuous small improvements will add up over time to boost overall performance. Regular channel evaluation helps maximize impact of every new video.
### Consider Video Sponsorships or Paid Promotion
While 100% organic growth is ideal, paid promotion including video sponsorships, and targeted YouTube/Google ads can give your channel the initial boost required to gain traction. 
Once videos start getting good engagement metrics from initially placed ads, YouTube is more likely to recommend it organically to more users. Consider a small promo budget of around $5-20 per video for 2-3 videos to kickstart the flywheel effect. Just be mindful to eventually wean off paid promotion as organic takes over.
In conclusion, a combination of on-page optimization, viewer engagement tactics, consistent uploads, cross-promotions and regular evaluation forms a solid foundation for any YouTube channel looking to increase views and traffic over the long run. With commitment to quality content and constant refinements, new channels can certainly break out on YouTube.
