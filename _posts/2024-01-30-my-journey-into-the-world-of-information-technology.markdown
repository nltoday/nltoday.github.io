### Starting with a Passion for Computers
Ever since I was young, I have always been fascinated by computers. While in school, I spent much of my free time tinkering with hardware and learning basic coding. This passion led me to pursue a degree in [Bachelor of Commerce](https://yt.io.vn/collection/ahl) where I also self-studied topics related to **operating systems** and **system hardware**. I took additional classes to learn the fundamentals of **programming in C** to start coding. Though my grades in BCOM were not the highest, I was determined to enter the IT field as that is where my true interests lay.

### Getting Early Experience in Tech Support  
While still studying for my BCOM, I started applying for various IT roles to gain some on-the-job experience. I landed a job as a **tech support executive** at a private company. This role allowed me to combine my studies with hands-on work involving providing technical assistance to users over phone and email. Troubleshooting a variety of hardware and software issues helped me expand my practical knowledge in areas like **networking, desktop support, software installation** and more. It was a steep learning curve but I enjoyed the challenges. This stint in tech support paved the way for me to formally start my career in the IT industry after graduating.
### Pursuing an MBA to Advance Further
After completing my BCOM, I wanted to progress to more specialized IT roles. However, most companies were seeking candidates with postgraduate qualifications. I realized an **MBA degree** would help open up better opportunities. I decided to enroll for a full-time MBA program with a specialization in **Information Technology Management**. The two-year course equipped me with managerial skills along with in-depth understanding of topics like databases, web technologies, cloud computing etc. It was an intense yet hugely rewarding experience. During my MBA studies, I also did internships with reputed organizations to gain industry exposure.
### Starting my Career in Banking IT 
With an MBA under my belt, I started applying aggressively for suitable roles. I got placed as a **junior programmer** at a leading public sector bank through campus selection. This marked the beginning of my banking IT career. In the initial years, I worked on various core banking projects involving development, testing and maintenance of different **banking applications and modules**. I participated in many technology upgrades and digital transformations undertaken by the bank. After gaining good experience in programming, I switched to the role of a **system analyst** where I was able to use my technical expertise as well as communicate effectively with multiple teams.
### Transitioning to Consulting and Moving Upwards
After close to a decade in the banking sector, I decided it was time for a change. I got an opportunity to join a top IT consultancy as a senior systems engineer. This role involved extensive client interactions, **requirement gathering, solution design** and implementing projects across domains for enterprises. In this challenging yet stimulating environment, I continuously upgraded my skills and qualifications. Within a few years, I was promoted to technology consultant and given leadership responsibilities. Now I work independently with clients on strategizing their IT initiatives focusing on areas like digital transformation, cloud migration, cybersecurity and more. I also mentor junior team members. Overall, it has been a very fulfilling career journey so far in the dynamic world of IT.
### Pursuing Specialized Certifications
To stay abreast with the latest technologies and continuously enhance my skillsets, I have been actively pursuing relevant industry certifications. Over the years, I have completed certifications from top vendors in domains such as **Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, Oracle, Cisco** covering aspects of programming, databases, cloud, networking etc. These certifications carry a lot of credibility and have helped me demonstrate expertise, command higher salaries as well as take up specialized roles. I aim to keep expanding my certification portfolio to gain deeper proficiency in emerging tech areas like blockchain, AI/ML, IoT and their applications. 
### Sharing Knowledge and Giving Back
With two decades worth of rich experience in banking, enterprise IT solutions and consulting, I feel it is important to share the learning I have gathered over the years. I actively mentor engineering graduates and young professionals starting out in their tech careers. Additionally, I conduct guest lectures and workshops on topics such as FinTech, digital transformation strategy, cloud migration best practices etc. for universities and industry forums. I also volunteer my time to revamp curriculum of computer science programs at local colleges to ensure students learn skills aligned to current industry needs. It gives me immense satisfaction to impart practical industry insights and guide the next generation of tech talent.
### Continuing the Journey of Lifelong Learning
The technology landscape keeps evolving at a rapid pace. As someone working right at the forefront of innovative solutions, I realize the need for constant learning. Even after so many years in the sector, there is no room for complacency. I make it a point to dedicate time regularly for self-study of new subjects. By constantly reading books, blogs, research papers, attending tech events and conferences, I aim to stay on top of upcoming breakthroughs and future trends. The road ahead looks brighter than ever before with exciting opportunities opening up every day. I am enjoying the journey and continually upgrading myself with the goal of touching and transforming more lives through technology.
