The Force is an energy field that surrounds and binds all living things together. While everyone is inherently connected to the Force, very few are able to wield its power and truly use the Force. Let's break down the key reasons why this is the case.
## The Role of Midi-chlorians 
Midi-chlorians are microscopic life forms that live symbiotically inside the cells of all living beings. They allow individuals to sense the Force and are essential for its use. Those with a high **midi-chlorian count per cell** have a stronger ability to detect the Force and greater potential to utilize its powers. 
Most beings in the galaxy have such a low midi-chlorian count that they cannot feel the Force at all. Their connection is too weak. Only a select few are born with a significant enough count to feel the Force and have the raw talent needed. But potential alone is not enough - intense training is also required.
## The Importance of Proper Training
Even for those with high midi-chlorian counts and natural Force sensitivity, simply having the ability is not the same as having the skill. True mastery over the Force demands long-term study and practice under the tutelage of experienced teachers. 
Without guidance on how to understand, control and channel one's connection, the Force remains untapped. This was evident in individuals like Finn, a defected Stormtrooper who showed Force sensitivity but lacked any training. He could feel the Force instinctively in moments of danger but did not know how to consciously apply its powers. 
Proper training strengthens one's connection while also teaching mental techniques like meditation, sense cultivation, telekinesis and more. [Years of apprenticeship](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-witch-dog-lovers-halloween-gift4268-t-shirt) are required to develop the deep understanding and discipline needed for advanced Force uses.
## Not All are Suited for the Rigorous Lifestyle
Even among the Force sensitive, not all have the dedication, willpower and ascetic mindset suited for the austere lifestyle of a Jedi or Sith. Wielding the Force is as much a spiritual path as a skillset. It demands single-minded focus, obedience to a strict code and temperance from attachments.
For most, consciously redirecting the invisible energy behind all life would be an incredible challenge. The stresses of sensing and influencing others, battling Dark Side temptations, and detaching from worldly pleasures prove too great for all but the most resolute. Only a rare few possess the fortitude and clarity of mind to fully commit themselves.
### Nature vs Nurture in the Force 
While midi-chlorians indicate inherent Force potential, one's upbringing and environment also impact how receptive they are to the Force. Being identified and inducted into Jedi training from a young age grants formative exposure that strengthens their affinity. 
In contrast, most grow up unaware of their potential and lack the stimuli that fuels latent talents. Without conscious cultivation, their abilities lay dormant. Even the naturally gifted may fail to recognize small Force-driven instincts if uncultured. Proper nurturing is key to unlocking one's fullest capabilities.

### Lack of Widespread Knowledge 
For much of history, knowledge of the Force was esoteric teachings kept secret by the Jedi and Sith Orders. Information did not freely circulate amongst the common population. Most were simply unaware that an innate ability may lurk within them, dismissive of its existence, or unable to discern its subtle signs.
Without a cultural framework to comprehend strange intuitions or recognize rare talents in kin, the Force went largely unnoticed in family lineages. Its mysteries remained unplumbed. Only through chance discovery or conscription by Jedi scouts could the gifted break from obscurity into consciously employing their predispositions.
## Conclusion
In summary, while all living things are connected to the Force on a fundamental level, only a tiny fraction possess what is needed to truly wield its power: high midi-chlorian counts combined with dedicated training, an ascetic lifestyle and a clarity of mind. Environmental factors and lack of widespread understanding have also kept the Force instincts of many from ever being unlocked to their fullest potential. Truly mastering the Force proves an immense challenge even for the most gifted.
