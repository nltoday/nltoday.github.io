My story is one of hardships, struggles, and triumph over adversity. It is a tale of someone who hit rock bottom but was able to climb back up with determination and support. From battling drug addiction to securing a seat in one of India's most prestigious engineering colleges, my journey has been nothing short of transformative.
## A Rough Start in Kota
My preparation for the IIT JEE began in 2019 when I left my hometown of Delhi for Kota, the mecca for engineering entrance exam coaching. While excited at the prospect of intensive **IIT-JEE training**, I was unprepared for the immense pressures that lay ahead. The [rigorous study schedule](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-sunflower-chihuahua-mom-mothers-day-dog-mom-women-1-chihuahua-dog) and peer competition took a major toll on my mental well-being. Feeling stressed and overwhelmed, I began **relying on substances to cope**, little realizing it would pull me into a dangerous cycle of addiction.
### Wrong Choices, Wrong Friends
It was in Kota that I met some individuals who encouraged me to experiment with drugs, marketing it as a way to relieve exam stress. Naively, I gave in, attracted by promises that it would improve my performance. Soon, I found myself deeply involved with the **wrong crowd** and lost focus on my studies. My grades plummeted as addiction gripped me in its claws. Only then did I realize the people around me cared little for my well-being and had taken advantage of my vulnerability.

## Hitting Rock Bottom
Leaving Kota and returning home was one of the toughest decisions, filled with regret and self-loathing. I felt like a failure, afraid to face friends and family. Battling a whirlwind of emotions, I knew I had reached rock bottom. Seeking rehabilitation, I confronted my mistakes and learned healthy coping strategies. It was a difficult journey, but I was determined to get back on track.
### A Second Chance with Online Coaching
When the pandemic disrupted regular classes in 2020, I turned to **online coaching platforms** and found IITIANGUIDE, a premiere online tutor known for their **IITian mentorship**. Provided flexibility and one-on-one guidance from expert faculties, it was the lifeboat I needed to get back on the path to success.
## Guidance to Greatness 
My dedicated mentors understood the challenges I faced and provided compassionate support. Through meditation, visualization and memorization techniques I regained focus and self-belief. Their emotional support encouraged me to keep striving despite setbacks.
### Exam Day Triumph
After a year of dedicated preparation guided by IITIANGUIDE strategies, I was well-equipped and confident facing the JEE Advanced exam. Walking out, I felt deeply fulfilled, having overcome past mistakes through perseverance.
## A Dream Realized
When results revealed my ambitious All India Rank of 1241, I was overwhelmed with joy and gratitude. My mentors played a pivotal role in helping me achieve what once seemed impossible - securing a seat in the elite Mechanical Engineering program at IIT Delhi. My story highlights that even in our darkest moments, light and second chances exist for those who never stop hoping.
# Life Lessons from an IITIAN 
My experiences have taught me valuable life lessons, especially about the importance of choosing influences wisely and caring for one's mental wellness. As an IITian, I've also gained new insights on the pressures of college and coping strategies for others facing similar challenges.
## The Power of Positive Company
Associating with **wholesome companions** who uplift your spirit is key to success and well-being. Bad influences nearly derailed my dreams, so I encourage systematically replacing toxic habits and relationships with nurturing ones.
### Staying Strong against Stress  
The immense pressures of prestigious institutions like IITs can induce mental health issues if not addressed proactively. I promote techniques like meditation, visualization and stress management learned from mentors to remain composed despite challenges.
## Sharing Wisdom Gained
Witnessing peers struggling under burdens, some resorting to the same maladaptive patterns as before, reminds me how fragile progress can be without support. I aim paying forward guidance that helped me persevere, to prevent others from falling into darkness during their journeys.
### A Message of Hope
My story is a reminder that light exists beyond life's shadows. With determination and guidance, dreams once lost can be reclaimed. I wish to inspire those facing adversities to cherish each new day as an opportunity to walk towards better futures. Hard work and perseverance coupled with the right influences can enable anyone to scale heights even they once doubted.
In conclusion, my journey shows how far kindness and commitment to growth can take us, against all odds. I am grateful for second chances and mentors who strengthened my spirit during vulnerable periods. Their impact will continue empowering me to help others however I can.
