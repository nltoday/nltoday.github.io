As the presidential limousine turned onto Elm Street and slowed to approximately 11 mph, three shots were fired in less than [six seconds](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-weightlifting-funny-deadlift-men-fitness-gym-gifts-tank-top4886-t-shirt). Governor John Connally, who was sitting in front of the president, was hit by the second shot and seriously wounded. The final, fatal shot struck President Kennedy in the head, causing a massive, devastating wound. Forensic evidence indicates the **fatal head shot was fired from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository located within Dealey Plaza**. 
### The Rushed Trip to Parkland Hospital 
With the president gravely injured and bleeding profusely from the head wound, the motorcade quickly sped to nearby Parkland Memorial Hospital. Secret Service agent Clint Hill leapt onto the back of the speeding limousine in an attempt to shield the president. First lady Jacqueline Kennedy clung desperately to her husband, attempting to hold his shattered skull together with her hands and clothes, covered and stained with his blood. The roughly four-minute drive to the hospital seemed an eternity.

### Initial Efforts to Save the President's Life
When the limousine arrived at the hospital around 12:38pm, President Kennedy was rushed on a stretcher into the emergency room, where doctors and nurses immediately began **heroic resuscitation efforts**. Though maintaining a weak pulse and shallow breathing upon arrival, the massive head wound was clearly catastrophic and fatal. External cardiac massage and electricity were used in an attempt to restart his heart. However, the damage to the brain was too extensive. 
### The Official Declaration of Death
Despite their valiant attempts to resuscitate the president over the next 30 minutes, it became evident the efforts could not overcome the magnitude of his injuries. At 1:00pm, Father Oscar Huber administered the last rites. A few moments later, attending physicians, including Dr. Kemp Clark, solemnly pronounced John Fitzgerald Kennedy dead from an **assassin's bullet**. The nation was plunged into shock and grief. A milestone in American history was tragically altered in the span of mere seconds on that fateful November day in 1963.
### The Autopsy Reveals Severity of Wounds
That evening, an autopsy was performed at Bethesda Naval Hospital. The procedure revealed the full extent of the horrific wounds. A small entry wound was found in the lower back of the president's neck, while the massive head wound exhibited a portion of his skull and brain tissue completely blown away. **Microscopic examination** showed fragments of the bullet and victim's skull throughout the brain matter on both sides. The cause of death was determined to be **"assassination by firearm"**.
### Public Reaction to the National Tragedy   
On the afternoon of November 22nd, news quickly spread of the **assassination of the president** in Dallas. People across America and around the world were stunned in disbelief at the shocking tragedy. Schools, businesses, and government offices closed as the nation grieved. In the days that followed, millions watched round-the-clock television coverage of memorial services and the funeral procession. The brutal assassination marked a significant moment that forever changed the country and the presidency. John F. Kennedy remains one of the most beloved presidents in American history. 
### Lingering Questions and Continued Debate
While the **Warren Commission** concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in assassinating President Kennedy, doubts and suspicions have persisted for decades. Numerous books and films have proposed alternate conspiracy theories questioning whether others may have been involved. To this day, the assassination evokes heated discussions. With some files still not released to the public for national security reasons, the full truth surrounding that fateful day may never fully come to light. The JFK assassination remains one of the most controversial events in modern American history.
