### Loneliness and Low Self-Esteem
I struggled with loneliness, depression, and poor self-esteem from ages 17 to 18. **low self-confidence issues teenager**. I watched too much TV instead of engaging in life. Additionally, I "broke up" with my closest friend for unnecessary reasons and took everything personally. This started a period of [compulsively watching too much pornography](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-dog-full-moon-at-night-dog-breed-chihuahua) and taking **unnecessary risks** like meeting strangers from dating sites. I never felt confident about getting a job or how others perceived me based on superficial factors.

### Seeking Help and Making Changes
To address these issues, I started regular counseling in university since their program covered **depression, anxiety, and other mental health support**. I also tried antidepressants for 6 months but did not like how they made me feel. Getting a stable government job gave me health insurance to continue counseling. Seeking other perspectives, I visited a shaman and started daily meditation. I tried escaping through adventures like hitchhiking across Washington and Oregon with $60.
### A Counselor's Life-Changing Advice 
A counselor suggested I go to Southeast Asia since the people are very friendly. **Southeast Asia friendly cultures Cambodia**. Around this time, I dated a younger Malaysian girl who was uncertain about her path. I encouraged her to follow her heart. On a call with her, on a whim I disconnected and booked a one-way ticket to Cambodia after minimal research. 
### Starting Anew in Cambodia
In Cambodia, life was very inexpensive allowing me to simplify completely. **Cambodia low cost of living expat teaching jobs**. I rented a comfortable home for $150 monthly, lived on $200 food budget or less. Jobs like teaching provided at least $1000 monthly salary exceeding living expenses. Disconnecting from news media removed noise and chaos adding to peace. Interacting solely through a quiet daily routine and books was refreshing. 
### Gaining Valuable Perspective
Being in an unfamiliar place among English-speaking locals expecting nothing from me was liberating. **gaining a new perspective healing solitude**. Without distraction and detached from past life, negative thought patterns slowly dissolved. Regular reflection revealed conditional habits perpetuating depression. Accepting reality as it is without desires gradually eliminated suffering. 
### Long-Term Improvements
Over a decade later, depression is gone though occasional sadness arises. **long-term depression recovery maintaining mental wellness**. Breaking patterns through radical change and solitude among new cultures truly helped mental health. Marriage and parenting brought fulfillment while daily spiritual guidance emails maintain growth. True happiness emerges from within, independent of external factors or people's opinions. One can overcome any challenges with determination and an open mind.
### Conclusion 
Each person's path is unique but radical life changes can provide new perspectives to heal deep wounds. **overcoming depression life challenges new beginnings non-attachment**. While not for everyone, escaping negatively influenced environments even temporarily was integral to my recovery. Accepting reality, detaching from desires, and embracing each moment fully with gratitude are keys to inner peace. One's inherent strength and willpower can conquer any mentalhealth obstacles.
