### [The Popularity of 2D Mario Games](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-with-santa-hat-cute-christmas-hat-chihuahua5563-t-shirt)
The Super Mario 2D platformer games are immensely popular, consistently outselling Nintendo's 3D Mario titles. The average 2D Mario game has sold over 20 million units compared to around 9 million for the average 3D Mario game. Fans and critics alike praise each new 2D Mario for its tight controls, clever level design, and captivating gameplay. The New Super Mario Bros series in particular stands out, routinely exceeding sales figures that other acclaimed Mario titles reach. Excluding the underperforming New Super Mario Bros U on Wii U, the games in this series far outsell Nintendo's other popular Mario franchises.

### **The Success of the New Super Mario Bros Franchise** 
New Super Mario Bros was originally released for the Nintendo DS in 2006. It sold over 30 million copies worldwide and revitalized the 2D Mario genre for handheld devices. 2008's New Super Mario Bros Wii brought the series to home consoles with a new co-op multiplayer focus. This title achieved the highest initial sales of any Wii game during its debut week and went on to sell over 82 million units globally. New Super Mario Bros 2 for the 3DS launched in 2012 and sold over 16 million copies. While New Super Mario Bros U underperformed due to the Wii U's commercial failure, the series overall has proven extremely successful for Nintendo across multiple generations.
### **Nintendo's Business Model Favors Super Mario Games**
With each new console generation, Nintendo faces the challenge of attracting third-party developers while growing its own first-party software sales. Having banked on the immensely popular Mario franchise for decades, the company understands intuitively that new **Mario platformers** translate almost directly into revenue. Releasing another New Super Mario Bros game for Switch makes strategic business sense, allowing Nintendo to rely on a proven formula that consistently delivers profits. The franchise's popularity endures because Mario titles masterfully combine casual accessibility with deep, rewarding gameplay accessible to all ages. 
### **Waiting for Odyssey Sales to Peak Before the Next Mario**
Super Mario Odyssey released for Nintendo Switch in October 2017 to widespread acclaim, with over 21 million copies sold to date. As one of the console's marquee launch titles, it understandably remains a top seller years after launch. Given Odyssey's success, Nintendo will want to avoid releasing a new Mario platformer too soon that could potentially detract from those ongoing sales. The company is undoubtedly in no rush, content to allow Odyssey and other first-party titles to drive the Switch's sustained momentum for the foreseeable future.
### **Development Timelines Point to a Future Release**
It took over 3 years to develop Super Mario Odyssey from its initial conception. Considering such lengthy production cycles, the lack of any official announcements thus far suggests a new 2D Mario is still some ways off. However, fans can likely expect one within the next 2-3 years as the Super Mario franchise remains central to Nintendo's strategy. Performing market research and laying the foundations for new titles is already underway. When sales of Odyssey and other key Switch games eventually begin to wane, a fresh 2D Mario may be primed for a well-timed boost while also serving as a system seller for residual Nintendo consoles. 
### **Remaking or Remastering Past Mario Games?** 
Some fans debate whether beloved older Mario games deserve remakes or remasters adapting them to modern sensibilities. However, the pixel art styling and tight controls holding up the test of time mean reworking the visuals risks diminishing what made these classics so beloved and timeless. Meanwhile, Nintendo remains content to port earlier 2D Marios directly with minimal changes. The sole exclusion may be Super Mario 64, whose transition to full 3D and more expansive world could potentially justify a full modern remake preserving what made it revolutionary while improving outdated technical elements through today's capabilities. For now, anticipation turns to what kind of creative concepts and fresh levels a new original 2D Mario might unveil for Switch.
### **Items Provide Adventure and Variety**
Part of what enriches any Mario adventure stems from power-ups, items, and extra abilities found throughout levels that continuously evolve the experience. Most items enhance exploration and combat encounters, whether through flight, added attacks, stat boosts or other means. However, a select few in Super Mario Bros. 3 feel more tacked-on without meaningful impacts. Chief among these is the Anchors' sole purpose of preventing Airship levels from moving after completion, sparing repeat clears - but what adventurer wouldn't relish rechallenging such ingenious concepts? Similarly, the Music Box serves a niche purpose skipping select stages, yet its activation also alters the map music in a jarring way without true benefit. Going forward, tighter item design can spark discovery and strategy across all encounters.
### **Fans Debate Ideal Remake or Sequel Concepts**
As the Nintendo Switch install base grows, debate continues around what 2D Mario concept might best leverage its hybrid capabilities. Some propose a fully-3D remake of Super Mario 64 expanding its revolutionary sandbox. Others argue a new title in the New Super Mario Bros series could introduce HD-2.5D graphical flourishes along with innovative multiplayer options for tabletop and handheld play. A small contingent favors a remake of 1999's underappreciated Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins for Game Boy, modernizing its charming visuals and unique robot-based levels. No matter the direction, Nintendo has demonstrated deftness refining tried-and-true Mario formulas for each generation while retaining the core elements making these adventures eternally appealing worldwide. With the franchise's sustained popularity on Switch, it seems only a matter of time before the next 2D installment arrives.
### **Conclusion** 
All signs point to Nintendo releasing another installment in the acclaimed New Super Mario Bros series for Nintendo Switch in the coming years. As the framework driving a portion of Nintendo's business success, Mario platformers deliver unparalleled profits that the company relies upon to supplement major releases. With Odyssey sales still strong, the timing isn't right presently. But as the Switch install base expands while third-party support ebbs and flows, expect a new 2D Mario to arrive strategically as conditions turn optimal - satisfying long-time fans and inviting fresh players into this revered video game universe. Based on sales trends and developer cycles, the window appears to be 2-4 years from now when anticipation will have built to a fever pitch.
