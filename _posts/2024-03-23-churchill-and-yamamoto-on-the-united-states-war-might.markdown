### The Joy of American Entry
Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of Britain at the time, was elated at America's entrance into World War 2 after the attack on Pearl Harbor. He knew "the United States was in the war, up to the neck and in to the death". This "greatest joy" turned the tide of the war. [Allied industrial might](https://store.fi.io.vn/best-chihuahua-dad-ever-retro-vintage-sunset6832-t-shirt) and manpower would prove decisive.

### A Strengthened Britain and Commonwealth  
Churchill told the U.S. Congress Britain was now "incomparably stronger" due to American supplies through "the lifeline" across the Atlantic. British resilience confounded predictions of defeat after the Fall of France. A united America "drawing the sword for freedom" gave hope to oppressed peoples of Europe to resist the "brutal, corrupt invader".
### Devastating Naval and Aerial Attacks   
Japan's surprise attacks stunned defenders in the **Pacific theater naval battles**. Churchill acknowledged problems from diverting resources from the Eastern fronts. America ramped up aircraft, weapons and troops despite defending Britain through Lend-Lease. The **Allied air power** buildup would turn the war.
### Hitler's Gross Underestimation
Adolf Hitler ridiculed America as "decadent" and "half Judaised, half negrified", unable to unite against him. But America's population, industry, and geographical position made conquest unfeasible. Ignoring America's **mobilization capacity** was Hitler's fatal error as Allied numbers continually grew. 
### Yamamoto's Daunting Assessment   
The Japanese admiral realized defeating America required an immediate "knockout blow" or was impossible long-term. America's **"arsenal of democracy"** belied puny forces initially in the Pacific. Its people, factories, and ability to rearm allies ensured Axis defeat against escalating Allied production of weapons, planes, ships and troops.
### Building the Tools of Victory
Despite early setbacks, America's industrial base transferred fully to **military manufacturing**. Factories churned out ships, tanks, aircraft, arms and supplies across continents. US headquarters in London coordinated the massive logistical undertaking. Newly trained GIs swelled ranks on all fronts late in the war.
### A Combined Might Crushes the Axis  
With America in the war "up to the neck", the tide relentlessly turned. Churchill stated optimistically "Hitler's fate was sealed. Mussolini's fate was sealed." Axis territory shrank under the hammer blows of Allied power. German cities collapsed under **strategic bombing**. Fascist dreams of world conquest smashed against the immovable object of united democratic resistance. The Second World War cemented America's emergence as a global superpower.
