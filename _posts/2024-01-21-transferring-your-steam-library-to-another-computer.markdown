### Moving Individual Games
<b>Steam game file copying process</b> can be used to transfer a single game from one PC to another. On the source computer, locate the game folder under Steamapps\common. Copy this entire folder and paste it on the destination computer under the same path. 
Additionally, you need to copy the <b>appmanifest file</b> for that game from the common folder. This file contains the game ID and is named "appmanifest_<gameid>.acf". To find the game ID, right click the game in Steam library and select "Manage" then "Add Desktop Shortcut". The game ID will be in the URL of the shortcut's properties. Restart Steam on the destination PC for it to recognize the new game. You may want to verify the game files as well.

### Transferring Your Entire Library 
To move your whole Steam library, first copy the entire Steam folder to the destination PC, keeping the folder structure intact. This includes the Steamapps folder containing all game installs. 
On the destination PC, delete all files from the Steam folder except steam.exe. Running this will install Steam and detect the existing game folders. It will verify the files but avoid redownloading everything, saving bandwidth. You'll just need to log into your Steam account to activate the library on the new machine.
### Using Removable Storage
If the computers can't directly access each other's drives, removable storage like an external hard drive or USB flash drive can be used instead. Copy the desired game folder from the Steamapps/common location on one PC to the removable drive. 
Plug the drive into the destination computer and paste the game folder into its own Steamapps/common folder. The game will launch as long as the Steam account signed in has a license for that title, linked to the account that originally installed it.
### Dealing with Multiple Computers 
Having access to your Steam library across different devices is convenient. Steam allows activating your account on up to five computers at once by default. Just log into the account on each system to gain access to your whole library, or use the above methods to manually transfer individual games as needed between those computers. 
Installing on more than five machines may deactivate the oldest machine linked to that account. Be sure to only activate systems you regularly use to avoid issues. You can also contact Steam support to request increasing the simultaneous device limit if needed.
### Handling Game Saves  
When moving your Steam library, do not forget to backup and transfer any game saves you want to keep too. These are usually stored outside the main game folders in documents folders linked to each title. 
Find the game's save directory on the original computer before moving the game files. Copy these over to the equivalent save location on the destination PC. This ensures you can pick up where you left off in games that support saving progress locally.
