Facebook Reels offers businesses and creators new opportunities to engage audiences across platforms. However, sharing Reels from Instagram to Facebook comes with certain considerations around content format, algorithm targeting, and visibility. In this article, we explore best practices for leveraging Facebook Reels effectively.
## Optimizing Reels for Multiple Platforms 
When sharing content between Instagram and Facebook, it's important to optimize for each individual platform. **Instagram Reels vertical format mobile-first video** is best served natively within the Instagram app. On the other hand, Facebook surfaces a variety of content including video, photos and links. To maximize opportunity:
### Uploading Separately 
Upload Reels natively to both Instagram and Facebook to ensure proper formatting for each environment. Unique content customized for every platform gives algorithms more chances to showcase your work to interested audiences.

### Leveraging Video Features 
On Facebook, take advantage of features like directly uploading videos, using video tags and optimizing titles/descriptions. Engage relevant Facebook groups and communities to increase reach of Facebook video content.
## Maximizing Visibility Across Networks
While sharing between apps allows tapping crossover audiences, reach isn't guaranteed. Facebook prioritizes its own native content. Mixing strategies can boost visibility:
### Cross-Promoting Content
Tease Instagram Reels on Facebook with preview images and a call-to-action linking back to watch full videos on Instagram. This drives traffic between the two networks. 
### Experimenting with Formats
Test sharing edited-down Reel clips natively on Facebook too. Short snippets may perform better than full-length videos on some platforms. Keep content optimized for each site.
### Leveraging Engagement 
Ask viewers to like, comment and share both Instagram and Facebook posts. Engagement increases the chances of algorithms featuring your content more prominently.
## Measuring Success Across Networks
Multiple factors like content, engagement and ever-evolving algorithms influence performance. Continuous experimentation helps fine-tune approach:
### Tracking Viewership Metrics
Monitor views, likes, comments and shares on all posts. This indicates what resonates best with specific audiences on each site.   
### A/B Testing Content   
Regularly test different video types, lengths, calls-to-action and sharing methods. Identify highest converting strategies through data.
### Adapting Based on Insights
Leverage learnings to focus future efforts where engagement is strongest. Adjust approach based on continuous analysis of cross-platform results.
With dedicated efforts to optimize Reels for Instagram and Facebook individually as well as synergize promotion between the two, businesses can maximize reach and returns across vast social audiences. Continuous testing and adaptation based on performance data leads to the most impactful long-term strategies.
