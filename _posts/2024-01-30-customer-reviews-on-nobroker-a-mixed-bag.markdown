### NoBroker's Poor Service Leaves Customer in the Lurch 
[Amit Kumar and Ankit Agrawal](https://yt.io.vn/collection/aispuro) received an strong worded complaint from an upset customer about the **completely disastrous moving experience** they had with NoBroker. The customer paid NoBroker in advance for packing and moving services scheduled on a certain date but on moving day, the service provider did not show up without any prior information or reason given. **The supposed NoBroker movement manager** also did not pick up calls from the customer, leaving them stranded without any solution or help. Only after multiple calls in the evening did the manager surface but admitted he could do nothing to assist. As a result, the customer had to find an alternate service provider last minute who agreed to take the job but for Rs. 10,000 more which NoBroker refused to bear. Faced with an urgent time crunch, the customer reluctantly agreed to the higher cost. Even after the move, the NoBroker manager offered no coordination or updates on delivery of goods, forcing the customer to chase carriers directly with over 40 calls for basic status updates. The customer strongly advised others to avoid NoBroker for such an important service due to their complete lack of accountability or customer support.

### Positive Experience Booking Packers Through NoBroker App 
A different customer shared a positive review of using NoBroker's app and services to book **packers and movers intra-city**. Needing to shift from Bangalore while currently situated out of town due to COVID-19, thorough research led the customer to choose between Amigo Extra Mile and NoBroker. NoBroker stood out for its **transparent app listings displaying estimated prices** for various move scopes. They then worked with NoBroker representatives like **Gaurav and Shalini** to get customized quotes and have all unusual questions addressed in detail, gaining confidence. On moving day, reputed partner Divakar Homeshifters showed up on time, communicated process live via Whatsapp video, and completed the job smoothly and professionally to the customer's distant satisfaction. Appreciating NoBroker's responsive team and reliable partner services, the customer concluded it was a **wonderful experience** they could recommend to others.
### NoBroker Freedom Pack Eases House Search Process
Another customer shared a mixed but overall positive two year experience using NoBroker. They first used NoBroker's services around **2 years ago to search for rental homes**, finding a house through the platform. Later when shifting locations, they purchased NoBroker's Rs. 1300 **Freedom membership** for unlimited home listings and agent support. Although a house wasn't found via NoBroker that time, booking packers and movers through them went smoothly. Assigned NoBroker **movement manager Waseem** selected reputed **Chetna Packers and Movers** who accomplished the task exceedingly well without any damage or hidden charges. Appreciating the stress-free **inter-city relocation process**, the customer expressed their experience with NoBroker has generally been great so far.
### Booking Cancelled with No Communication from NoBroker  
In contrast, one client faced a disappointing situation arranging their home move with NoBroker's assistance. After paying the initial token amount, the packing and shifting dates were confirmed for a month later. However, when that day arrived, the customer was **not informed of any changes or cancellations in advance**. Attempting to reach the designated NoBroker movement manager proved futile as calls went unanswered. Only late in the evening did the manager reluctantly admit being unable to find an alternate service provider to conduct the relocation. Left scrambling last minute without solutions from NoBroker, the client was compelled to independently hire a removal company willing to take the job but for a Rs. 10,000 premium. The **complete lack of communication or responsibility shown** by NoBroker in cancelling the agreed booking and then failing to rectify the situation left the customer feeling **let down and dissatisfied**.
### Clear Communication Lacking in Disrupted Service 
In reviewing their experience, the frustrated client critiqued NoBroker's engagement severely. It was apparent all NoBroker representatives cared about was collecting their 10% commission upon booking without any follow up **to ensure smooth execution of the paid service**. When unavoidable disruption occurred, **clear communication** to the client was noticeably absent. Instead, multiple unanswered phone calls were required just to track down the movement manager, who offered no practical resolutions. Being forced to independently handle the problematic circumstances caused unnecessary stress. The customer cautioned others against relying on NoBroker for important relocation needs due to this display of scant dedication after payment is received. Proper coordination and accountability for any service issues seemed to be deficient on NoBroker's part in this case.
### Overall Sentiment - Room for Improvement in Customer Support
Drawing from both positive and concerning client reviews shared, it appears NoBroker's core services of listings brokers and vetted partners perform well generally in facilitating home rentals and relocations. App functionality and initial pricing transparency have been praised. However, complaints have arisen where important services booking with NoBroker undergo unexpected change or cancellation down the line. The **absence of clear communication from NoBroker representatives and lack of resolution support** in these disrupted scenarios is a recurring criticism. While not all experiences will pan out smoothly, customers rightly expect the platform to demonstrate stronger commitment **to offer alternatives or compensate for difficulties outside their control** to retain loyalty and trust. NoBroker may benefit their reputation by bolstering responsive customer care policies specially geared to handle exceptions with empathy, transparency and accountability for the clients they serve.
