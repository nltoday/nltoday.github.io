## Understanding the Problem
This puzzle involves understanding relations between ages over time. Let's break it down step-by-step:
### When the Puzzle Poser was 4 Years Old
We are told that when the puzzle poser was 4 years old, their sister's age was half of their own age. Half of 4 is 2, so the sister was 2 years old at that time.

### Determining Current Ages
The puzzle poser states that they are now 100 years old. If their sister was 2 years younger than them when the puzzle poser was 4, then the sister must now be 100 - 2 = 98 years old.
## Analyzing Common Misconceptions
### Why Most People Answer 50 Initially 
Many people's initial reaction is to assume the sister's current age is half of the puzzle poser's age. Half of 100 is 50. However, this fails to account for the **time-dependent age difference** established when the puzzle poser was 4.
### Realizing the Mistake 
Once people realize they need to consider the ages from when the puzzle poser was 4, rather than just taking half the current age, they recognize their initial answer of 50 was incorrect.
## Evaluating Claims About Education Level
### Alternative Explanations 
Rather than making claims about an entire country's education system, there are more plausible alternative explanations for why most people get this puzzle wrong at first. 
### Normal Human Fallibility
It's common for people to make mistakes in mathematical word problems that involve multiple steps of reasoning over time. Jumping to conclusions about education levels is an overstatement.
### Benefit of the Doubt
Unless there is clear supporting evidence, it's better to give others the benefit of the doubt rather than accusations. People are fallible, and context is important for full understanding.
## Deeper Discussion of Time Relationships
### Establishing a Baseline 
This puzzle introduces a baseline age relationship between the puzzle poser and their sister at a specific point in time: when the puzzle poser was 4 years old.
### Reasoning About Changes Over Time
From that baseline, we must then reason about how that age difference would evolve as both people age forward through time. This step-wise thinking is where many get tripped up initially. 
### Practicing Temporal Reasoning Skills
Puzzles like this provide an opportunity to strengthen abilities in temporal/chronological reasoning - an important logical and quantitative skill. With practice, these types of multi-step "age over time" puzzles become easier to unpack and solve.
## Conclusion 
This puzzle presents a deceptively simple concept - determining someone's age given their age relation to another person at a past time. However, it reveals common gaps in unpacking time-based logical relationships that involve reasoning over multiple steps. With careful analysis and avoidance of assumptions, the true answer - 98 years old - can be determined. Puzzles like these help improve logical and quantitative abilities for understanding real-world problems involving changes over time.
