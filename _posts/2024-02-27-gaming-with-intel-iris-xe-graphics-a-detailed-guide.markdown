### Past Generation Titles 
Intel Iris Xe is capable of running many moderately demanding AAA titles from the past generation, which includes games released before the launch of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in late 2020. Titles like the Grand Theft Auto, Mass Effect, The Witcher, and Batman franchises can generally be played at 720p resolution with settings lowered to maintain a steady 30 frames per second. Some resolution tweaks may boost performance further, but likely with some loss of visual fidelity.

### Esports and Less Demanding Games
Recent online multiplayer and competitive **"esports games"[ like ](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/chihuahua)Valorant** and **Total War: Warhammer** have been shown to hit 60fps on Intel Iris Xe at lowered settings. Less graphically intensive current games may also perform adequately. Titles in genres like indies, 2D games, and simulators are good options. Resolution can typically be kept at 1080p for these smoother experiences. 
### AAA Titles Will Struggle
The latest AAA blockbusters from major publishers, such as **Red Dead Redemption 2, God of War,** and **Horizon Zero Dawn**, push the Iris Xe to its limits. These **"ultra HD gaming"** titles may launch but struggle to maintain playable framerates, even at reduced quality presets and resolutions well below 1080p. Integrated graphics are simply not powerful enough for the cutting-edge visuals and expansive open worlds of modern flagship releases.
### Consider Your Notebook 
Keep in mind that many laptops with only Iris Xe graphics are thin-and-light ultrabooks designed for portability over intense workload times. Prolonged gaming sessions could cause performance throttling and thermal issues. It's best to choose a machine with ample ventilation and cooling abilities if utilising the Iris Xe extensively for gaming purposes.
### Aim for Esports at 1080p
Most games released in the past 5 years should be playable on Iris Xe graphics if willing to compromise on settings quality. However, for the smoothest experience, focusing on competitive **"esports titles"** and playing at 1080p with lower presets is advised. This will provide an enjoyable and smooth gameplay, without pushing the hardware past its limits. 
### Test Titles Yourself
The best approach is to research games you're interested in playing and looking for first-hand reports on Intel Iris Xe performance online. Factors like resolution, settings presets, framerates and system specifications all impact the experience greatly. When possible, testing playable game demos or trial versions yourself on your own system will give the most reliable indicator of what to realistically expect.
