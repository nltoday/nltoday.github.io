### Plastic Pants and More Surprising Outfits
Stray Kids member Hyunjin is well known among fans for his good looks and dancing abilities. However, there was one particular outfit that he likely wishes to forget - [plastic pants](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-custom-proud-football-grandma-number-60-personalized-women-v-neck-t-shirt/men&). During one performance, Hyunjin found himself stuck wearing a pair of skin-tight plastic pants that were nearly impossible to move in. He struggled through the entire stage, no doubt feeling embarrassed the whole time. Fortunately for Hyunjin, he has since escaped wearing the dreaded plastic pants again. 
Other idols have also had their share of memorable, and sometimes questionable, outfit choices over the years. Exo's D.O. wore an unusual spiked leather top for their "Wolf" performances that left fans puzzled. Was the stylist going for an edgy rock look or something else entirely? Tao of EXO also sported a unusual long sweater-dress hybrid at one point that had viewers doing a double take. Just what were the designers thinking with some of these adventurous outfit choices?

### Crop Tops and More Surprising Looks 
Shinee's Taemin is well known for his daring fashion sense and impressive dance skills. However, one particular crop top he wore during a stage took exposing outfit trends to a new level. With little more than pieces of fabric barely covering his torso, fans could not believe the idol was comfortable performing in such an revealing piece. While Taemin pulls off unique styles beautifully, this may have been pushing the limits a bit too far. 
CL of 2NE1 also took a risk with one unforgettable performance outfit- a full bodysuit resembling a neon unicorn. Between the bold colors and animal print design, it was definitely a standout look. However, it was so over the top that fans still debate whether it was genuinely fashion-forward or just plain bizarre. At least CL owned the eccentric outfit with her confident stage presence.
NCT 127's Mark has proven himself a fashion risk-taker as well. For one live stage, he wore an unusually long draping piece that fell almost to his ankles. Resembling more of a decorative tablecloth than high fashion, viewers could not help but jokingly call him "mOrk" in comments. While bold and experimental, this dramatic outfit choice did Mark no favors visually. Perhaps the stylists should have rethought this one.
### Red Velvet Surprises Fans with Eclectic Outfits
The members of Red Velvet are no strangers to showcasing unique fashion both on and off stage. During one performance, singer Wendy stood out in a neon blue frilly mini dress absolutely covered in ruffles and flounces. Between the loud colors and over-the-top detailing, fans could not look away from her ultra-feminine yet playful look. Wendy pulled off the eclectic outfit with confidence as always. 
Groupmate Irene has also turned heads with her risqué outfit choices in the past. For their "Zimzalabim" comeback, she wore a pale pink ruched mini dress with cut-outs exposing much of her toned midriff. While pushing fashion boundaries is nothing new for Red Velvet, some felt this look was a bit much even for their usually adventurous styles. However, Irene carried the sultry outfit perfectly as expected.
Hwasa of girl group Mamamoo is equally daring when it comes to fashion. During one music show performance, she stunned in a form-fitting plastic mini skirt and matching crop top. Hugging her curves in all the right places, she totally owned the risqué and innovative outfit. Plastic may seem an unusual fabric choice, but Hwasa demonstrated how to rock even the most experimental of looks with attitude and charisma.
### Idol Outfits Range from Practical to Peculiar 
While K-pop idols regularly sport trendy and elaborate stage costumes, not every outfit choice lands quite right. During NCT 127's "Regular" era, Mark stood out in a floor-length draping piece reminiscent of a curtain or table runner. Revealing little about his frame and doing him no favors stylistically, fans still jokingly call this his "mOrk" look years later. Perhaps it was an attempt at avant-garde that missed the mark. 
Other idols have tried novel outfit concepts that just came across as downright strange. Exo's D.O. donned some type of spiked leather harness for their "Wolf" performances that left viewers perplexed. Just what story was the stylist attempting to tell with this impractical choice? Tao of the same group also sported an odd long sweater dress hybrid at one point that seemed out of place for a male idol. Not all experimental outfit risks pay off it seems. 
Then there was the time CL of 2NE1 took a massive chance in a full bodysuit that resembled nothing so much as a giant neon unicorn. Between the bold colors and animal print, it was a striking if totally wacky look. While CL valiantly rocked the eccentric ensemble, it was truly a costume pushing boundaries of taste and practicality. Did the stylist have a deeper fashion message or simply want to push limits? Views remain divided on this particular choice.
### Idols Continue to Surprise Fans with Bold Styling 
Despite the fashion misses of the past, K-pop idols continue expanding the boundaries of stage style today. Hwasa of Mamamoo wears innovative latex and plastic ensembles that are as risqué as they are avant-garde. Slaying in figure-hugging mini skirts and cropped tops constructed of unusual materials, she demonstrates an unparalleled ability to stylishly break conventions. Her fashionable experimentation continues inspiring fans worldwide.
Red Velvet also stays on the cutting edge with daring outfit selections. For their "Zimzalabim" promotions, group leader Irene stunned in a pale pink ruched mini dress with strategic cut-outs baring her toned midsection. Pushing the limits of acceptable skin, she exuded charisma and confidence in the risqué number. Irene consistently showcases how to carry risqué trends with class and poise.  
Likewise, fellow Red Velvet member Wendy regularly takes sartorial chances others might avoid. For one performance, she stood out from her bandmates in a neon blue frilly mini covered from hem to neck in ruffles, froth and flounces. Between the loud hues and overabundance of intricate detailing, it stole the show for its sheer uniqueness and playful femininity. Wendy wears her fashion chances fearlessly as always.
With K-pop idols constantly innovating the boundaries of acceptable idol fashion, what other avant-garde outfit surprises may be in store? Whether hits or misses, their dedication to trendsetting style keeps audiences watching in amused anticipation of what's to come. Memorable costumes are clearly part of what makes the world of K-pop so exciting.
### Idol Fashion Pushes Creative Limits
While not all risk-taking outfit choices have succeeded artistically or practically, fans appreciate idols' ongoing fashion experimentation. Taemin of SHINee became an icon with his daring crop tops and sheer pieces exposing most of his torso. Pushing accepted revealing standards, he inspires others to explore self-expression freely. Likewise, Hwasa of Mamamoo owns risqué latex designs in a confident feminine way few can match. Her innovative material selections continue inspiring the K-pop world.  
Red Velvet consistently push creative boundaries as well. For "Zimzalabim", leader Irene sported a revealing ruched mini-dress exuding sexy confidence. She demonstrates how to carry risqué trends with elegance. Meanwhile, fellow member Wendy shines in eclectic pieces saturated with unique textiles, prints and necklines. Her fearless approach to experimentation encourages others.
While not all fashion chances land perfectly, idol dedication to avant-garde styling keeps audiences watching in amused intrigue. Successes or not, their passion for trendsetting inspires fans worldwide. Memorable costumes clearly enhance K-pop’s fun, diverse culture. As idols bravely innovate, the future of boundary-pushing idol fashion looks bright. Their commitment to creativity and self-expression elevates the art form for years to come.
