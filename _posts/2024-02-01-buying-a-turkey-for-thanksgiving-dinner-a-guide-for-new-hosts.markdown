### Choosing The Right Size Turkey
To begin, let's discuss the most important consideration - choosing the right size turkey. As a general guideline, plan for 1-1.5 pounds of raw turkey per person. **For a group of 8-12 people**, you'll need a turkey weighing **12-16 pounds**. 
Bigger turkeys between **16-20 pounds** are suitable for groups of 10-14 people. The key is allowing for ample leftovers. Larger turkeys have a higher meat-to-bone ratio, so you can get away with slightly less per person. Still, **aiming for 1.5 pounds per person** is a safe bet if you want turkey sandwiches and soup for days after the big meal.

### Factoring In Leftovers
Are turkey leftovers important to you? Do you love having them for meals later in the weekend? If so, an **18-20 pound turkey** will guarantee plenty of extra meat. The bones can then be used to make a delicious turkey soup. Don't forget to [properly store and refrigerate any leftovers within 2 hours](https://yt.io.vn/collection/aburto) to keep them safe.
### Giving The Turkey Time To Thaw
When buying a frozen turkey, it's crucial to plan ahead for thawing. A **16-18 pound bird needs around 5 days in the refrigerator** to thaw slowly and safely. This prevents bacteria growth that could cause foodborne illness. You can also thaw your turkey in a brine or dry rub solution during the final day before roasting. This adds extra moisture and flavor. Just be sure not to skip the refrigeration step.
### Preparing The Perfect Brine Or Dry Rub 
Soak your turkey in a homemade brine the day before cooking for juicy, flavorful meat. A basic brine contains salt, sugar, vinegar or citrus juice, and warm water. Let it cool before submerging the turkey breast side down. Or use a dry rub of fresh herbs, salt, and spices under the skin and all over. Either method takes your plain turkey to the next level. Be sure to thoroughly pat it dry before roasting.
### Roasting Tips For A Perfectly Cooked Turkey
When it's time to roast, don't overcrowd your oven. Make sure to leave plenty of space around the turkey for air circulation. Tent it loosely with foil if the skin browns too quickly. Roast breast side up at 325°F, allowing 15 minutes per pound for an uncomplicated bird. Use an oven safe thermometer to check the internal temperature reaches 165°F. Let it rest at least 20 minutes before slicing for tenderest meat.
### Making Delicious Turkey Leftovers Stretch
With your perfectly cooked turkey, you'll have plenty of meat for uses beyond the Thanksgiving table. **Turkey sandwiches, salads, tacos and burritos** are easy lunch or dinner ideas. Turkey tetrazzini, pot pie or curry are satisfying homemade meals. And don't forget about turkey soup! The bones add so much flavor to a broth-based soup with **vegetables like carrots, celery and onion**. Your holiday feast provides nourishment all weekend long.
### Planning Will Make Hosting Stress-Free
By taking the time to properly plan your turkey selection, thawing, cooking and using leftovers, you'll be prepared for a successful Thanksgiving meal. Factor in a larger bird and additional choices if hosting a sizable group. With some guidance on sizes and dishes, new hosts can feel confident cooking the star of any Thanksgiving feast - the turkey! With careful planning, it's sure to turn out perfectly.
