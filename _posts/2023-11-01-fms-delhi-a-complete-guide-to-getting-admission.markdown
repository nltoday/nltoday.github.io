## The Best College for ROI in India
Faculty of Management Studies or FMS Delhi is consistently regarded as one of the top B-schools in India. Established in 1954, FMS Delhi is counted among the top 5 business schools in the country. Over the decades, it has built a strong reputation for providing a high [return on investment](https://yt.io.vn/collection/alday) compared to other top MBA colleges.
### Low Fees Structure
While **IIMs charge an annual fee of around Rs. 10 lakhs**, FMS Delhi has a much more affordable fee structure of approximately Rs. 1 lakh per year. This moderate fee makes the two-year PGDM program at FMS extremely cost-effective compared to the premium charged by IIMs.

### Small Batch Size
Another key advantage of FMS Delhi is its smaller batch size of around 226 students. This is less than half the batch size of most IIMs. The smaller class size allows for more individual attention from faculty and better learning outcomes. 
## Scoring High in CAT is Crucial
To have a realistic shot at admission to FMS, scoring high in CAT is the first step. FMS shortlists candidates based on a **weighted CAT score**, giving 40% weightage to VARC and 30% each to DILR and QA. An additional 5 marks are given to women applicants.
### Boost Your VARC Percentile 
Since VARC section gets the highest weightage, aiming for above **99.5 percentile** can significantly boost chances of a call. Even with average scores in other sections, a very high VARC percentile could help one get shortlisted.
### No Minimum Section Criteria
Unlike many B-schools, FMS does not impose any minimum sectional percentile criteria. So a relatively weaker performance in one section can be compensated through other sections.
## The Final Selection Process
Once shortlisted based on CAT score, the final selection considers other parameters like 10th and 12th marks, Statement of Purpose, personal interview and extempore. 
### Academic Records
Marks above 75% will earn full marks, while 60-75% will get 5 marks each for 10th and 12th. Scores below 60% get no marks.
### Statement of Purpose  
The SOP carries a weightage of 10% of the final score. It is important to clearly articulate your goals and aspirations through a well-written SOP.
### Personal Interview
Carrying 15% weightage, interviews at FMS are generally shorter than other B-schools. Focus on being confident with a clear thought process during this interaction.
### Extempore Round
This round accounts for 5% of the final score. Regular practice on current affairs and fluency in presenting thoughts will help in the extempore presentation.
### Reservations for Female Candidates  
An additional 5 marks are given to women at the final selection stage. This year, around 65 out of 101 general seats went to female candidates in the first list owing to this criterion.
To summarize, a **composite score above 66** is required to have a good chance of admission to FMS for general category males. Focused preparation and scoring high in all stages of selection can help one achieve admission to this top B-school with high ROI.
