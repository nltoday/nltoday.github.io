### Focus On Yourself
When someone needs space or time alone, refrain from constantly waiting by the phone or texting them endlessly. This will only stress you out more and push the other person away. Instead, focus on self-care during this time. Pursue your own hobbies, spend time with friends and family, go for walks in nature - anything to take your mind off the situation and keep you busy.

### Give Them Breathing Room  
People need moments to themselves to recharge and process their thoughts and feelings. By hovering and demanding constant attention, you deprive them of this critical personal time. Respect that others may approach relationships differently than you. Unless there is a valid safety concern, grant your partner the freedom and trust to engage with you again when they are ready. **trust building communication boundaries respect**
### Don't Take It Personally    
It's normal to feel insecure or worried when someone pulls away, but try not to internalize it as a reflection of your worth. Their desire for space likely has more to do with their own needs than any shortcomings on your part. Remind yourself that other factors could be at play of which you have no knowledge. Have confidence that a healthy relationship can withstand periods of separate focus without unraveling. **self esteem self worth emotional regulation assumptions**
### Practice Self-Care Routines
When you're worried about someone not contacting you, shift your energy into nurturing your well-being. Spend quality time doing deliberately relaxing activities. Maintain healthy daily routines such as exercising, cooking balanced meals, connecting socially via text or video chat. Ensure you're showering needs for rest, fun and mindfulness. A calm, grounded inner state will serve you better than stewing in anxiety. **stress management mental health routines relaxation self care**
### Don't Rush Them     
Fighting the natural ebb and flow of interactions will only breed resentment on both sides. Respect the pace that feels right for the other person without demands or accusations. Change happens gradually through openness, not force. With patience and compassion, difficult conversations can occur when timing is better for productive understanding. For now, accept where things stand gracefully. **conflict resolution patience communication understanding relationships**  
### Maintain Perspective
A request for breathing room need not spell doom. Relationships take effort from multiple angles. Have faith that with ongoing care, honesty and compromise, you can weather periodic tensions. Do not toss away what you have built based on a present discomfort. Instead, care for yourself mentally and emotionally so you can view this challenge with nuance, not panic. Time and space may reveal a strengthened bond emerges. **long term relationships optimism resilience perspective challenges growth**
