### The Early Years
Nintendo began as a small company producing hanafuda playing cards in Kyoto, Japan in the late 1880s. Over the decades, the company ventured into several toy and novelty businesses before it finally found massive success in the video game industry in the 1970s. After [playing card manufacturing](https://store.fi.io.vn/game-controller-christmas-for-video-gamers-boys-kids-455/women&), Nintendo started producing other toys and novelties including coin-operated candy vending machines, toy love tests, and even a **taxi company reservation system** before it discovered its true calling in the emerging home video game market.

### The Birth of Modern Video Gaming
Led by pioneer video game developer **Gunpei Yokoi**, Nintendo released its first electro-mechanical games under the **Nintendo Play** brand in the late 1970s. Popular early Nintendo games included the **Light Gun** game Shooting Gallery and the LCD handheld game Block Fall, precursor devices to modern video gaming. Nintendo then launched its first home console - the **Color TV-Game** series in 1977, considered the first dedicated home video game consoles. The series became a runaway success and convinced Nintendo's leadership of the viability of video games.
### Global Domination Begins 
In 1983, Nintendo released the **Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)**, known as **Famicom** in Japan, forever changing the video game industry and popular culture. Breakout titles on the NES such as Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda and Metroid inspired millions of players worldwide and cemented Mario and Link as iconic pop culture figures. The NES went on to sell over 60 million units globally, making it the best-selling home console of its generation. Riding on the success of the NES, Nintendo then released the immensely popular **Game Boy** handheld in 1989 which became the best-selling portable game system of all time with over 200 million units sold to date.
### The 16-Bit Wars and SNES Dominance
The 1990s saw Nintendo locked in fierce competition with Sega in what is remembered as the "16-bit wars". In 1990, Sega launched the powerful **Sega Genesis** to challenge Nintendo's outdated NES. Nintendo smartly countered in 1991 with the **Super Nintendo Entertainment System**, or **Super Famicom** in Japan. Boasting impressive 16-bit graphics capabilities, the **SNES** quickly outsold the Genesis with groundbreaking games like Street Fighter II, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Super Mario World. The SNES went on to become the best-selling console of its generation with sales of nearly 50 million units worldwide.
### A New Generation of Formats
As CD-ROM technology grew in the mid-1990s, Sega and Sony launched new consoles utilizing the new format - the **Sega Saturn** and original **PlayStation**. Nintendo opted to stick with cartridges for its next console, unveiling the cartridge-based **Nintendo 64** in 1996. While the N64 sold over 30 million units, its reliance on expensive cartridges hurt third party support. Meanwhile, the PlayStation outsold all other consoles that generation thanks to its use of cheaper, higher capacity CDs. Nintendo also released a successor to the Game Boy - the **Game Boy Color** which added color to the beloved handheld series.
### Transitioning to New Formats
At the turn of the new millennium, Nintendo began the transition to optical disc formats. In 2001, Nintendo released the **GameCube** which used miniDVD discs and introduced landmark titles like Super Smash Bros. Melee. While respected for its library, the GameCube sold poorly compared to the **PlayStation 2** which became the best-selling console of all time. In 2004, Nintendo followed up on the **Game Boy Advance** handheld with the backward compatible **Nintendo DS** which featured dual screens and a touch interface. The DS became the best-selling handheld with over 154 million units sold. 
### The Switch to Hybrid Format
In 2012, Nintendo launched the **Wii U** console which struggled against the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The underperforming Wii U led Nintendo to rethink its business model, unveiling the innovative **Nintendo Switch** hybrid console/handheld in 2017. Combining home console power with portable play, the Switch sold over 100 million units in just five years, making it Nintendo's fastest selling console ever. With award-winning first party games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey, the Switch has reignited Nintendo's fortunes as the top-seller in its generation. Under new President Shuntaro Furukawa, Nintendo continues to excite fans and outperform expectations with its unique hybrid approach to gaming.
### Legacy of Innovation and Joy
From humble beginnings in the 1880s as a playing card company, Nintendo has evolved into one of the world's most recognizable brands through innovative hardware and software. Pioneering portable and hybrid gaming formats with systems like the Game Boy and Switch, Nintendo has delighted fans for over 130 years with beloved characters in franchises like Mario, Zelda, and Pok√©mon. While the company experienced challenges adapting to new disc formats in the 32- and 64-bit eras, Nintendo has proven time and again that it can reinvent itself through bold new ideas like motion controls and hybrid play. As Nintendo looks ahead to its next creative hardware concept, what remains unchanged is the **joy of play** the company has brought to generations of loyal fans worldwide.
