### Evidence for Extraordinary Claims
For extraordinary claims like the existence of God, one must provide extraordinary evidence. Common claims like having a dog or eggs for breakfast require little evidence to believe, but extraordinary abilities like flying require a high bar of evidence.
People throughout history have claimed the existence of deities like [Zeus](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/aldinger), **Thor**, and the **Christian God**. However, most people today don't believe in Zeus or Thor even though others believed them in the past. To believe in one's own deity, they must provide evidence that meets the same bar as the extraordinary claims, not just an ordinary level.

### Requesting Demonstrable Miracles  
One atheist stated they would be willing to reconsider their non-belief if shown clear miracles, such as **turning water to wine** before their eyes. Other options suggested were **raising the dead from a cemetery** and verifying identity with **DNA testing**, **walking on water**, or **multiplying loaves and fish** to feed thousands. Repeated scientific studies also showing the **power of prayer** and its effects could provide reasonable evidence. Even **appearing as burning bush** or summoning **angels or demons** might change this person's mind.
### Faith vs. Evidence
Believers often argue that faith alone is enough without evidence. However, faith alone does not meet the evidential standard required to overcome an extraordinary claim. Blind belief is not a reasonable position without justification. Extraordinary abilities demand proof through extraordinary demonstration before being reasonably accepted. Personal conviction through faith may satisfy believers, but it does not fulfill the skeptic's demand for publicly verifiable evidence. 
### Burden of Proof Lies with Claimants
Since God's existence is an assertion made by believers, **the burden of proof lies with them as claimants** to convince others. If they want non-believers to accept their claim, they must provide good reasons supported by tangible evidence, not just arguments or citations of ancient texts. Personal conviction is insufficient for general acceptance - there must be publicly examinable demonstrations that meet or exceed the extraordinary nature of the claim. Without this, atheists have no cause to accept assertions on faith alone.
### The Need for Falsifiability 
Even if miracles or demonstrations occurred, skeptics might question natural explanations or propose alternative interpretations without independent verification. For a claim to be scientifically valid, it requires **falsifiability** - the ability for it to be disproven. If miracles could only be attributed to God alone without any other possible explanation, that presents an unfalsifiable assertion. Repeated skeptic-approved experiments showing statistically significant effects of prayer may establish confidence in its supernatural source over natural factors. But unfalsifiability leaves room for continued rational non-belief.
### Conclusion
Insummary, while faith satisfies believers personally, to reasonably convince atheists requires publicly verifiable **EXTRAORDINARY EVIDENCE** that meets or exceeds the lofty bar demanded for such an incredible claim as God's existence. Repeatable scientific studies, miracles with multiple credible eyewitnesses and recordings, or divine manifestations may fulfill this need. But arguments, ancient texts, and appeals to faith alone will likely not suffice for skeptics seeking tangible justification before accepting miraculous propositions on their face. The believer takes faith; the atheist demands proof.
