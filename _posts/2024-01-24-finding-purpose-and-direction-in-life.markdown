### Your Definition of Career
Well, what’s your definition of career? A job or something you will do for the rest of your working days? I’ve gone from education, to sales, to [renewable energy](https://yt.io.vn/collection/akridge), to government, to the building industry and back to government — I’ve done alright, have a good salary and nice homes. I am educated but it was one of those “just pick a career already” things because I’ve never had a strong passion for anything in particular.

### Focus on What's Important
What I recently decided in the last year is to focus on what is important to me. Is working my ass off most important to me? No. Is being the most important person in the room most important? Also no. For some people it is. I do love being "the expert" at whatever I do without too much pressure to be the only one that can help the company. I want a job with work life balance and I try to always be the best at whatever I am chosing to do at that time.
### Finding Satisfaction in the Present  
I’m in a good spot now. I make a good income, don’t manage people, only responsible for my work.. but it’s actually not anything I “enjoy” doing. I do enjoy having three day weekends, several weeks of vacation time, and all government holidays. For me, finding a job that allows me to enjoy my time away from work is now more important than the prestige of the actual work. 
### Non-Traditional Career Paths
One thing I’ve learned is that there is no straight and direct path in life. I was one to say that I would never join the army when I was younger. Things happen and sometimes it opens your eyes to make you realize that you aren’t maximizing your potential or even doing something of worth. I tried college a bunch of times and dropped out everytime and when I was 27, I decided that I would join the army. I got out the army after my first enlistment because I didn’t want the lifestyle of moving constantly and because my wife was well into her career when we met.
### Keeping an Open Mind 
You’re 32, I started my internship when I was 35. From one vet to another, you have to find your purpose and what works for you and you can do it. We sometimes feel that if we don’t reach success by a certain point then we’re failures, but as long as you have life, you have an opportunity to find what works for you. Hooah.
### Embracing New Experiences
I joined the army at 17, to be a medic. At 25, I went to school for gunsmithing. I bounced around between jobs for a while. I’ve never been unemployed for more than 2 weeks, unless I wanted to be. There’s been stretches where I’ve just had no work to do, but that’s different than being unemployable. I’m not talking about trades, because those are specialists too. I do a little plumbing, gunsmithing, mechanicking, woodworking, machining, welding — I suck at it, as much as I suck at doing surgeries. 
### Finding Purpose Through Service
Eventually, after burning out from ‘the civilized world’, I ended up out in the middle of nowhere, working online. I was transcribing and hearing a bunch of horrible stuff, day after day after day. It was making me insane and miserable to live with. So, recognizing the impossibility of the ideal, surely any effort in that direction couldn’t hurt, right? But where to start? Realizing the power of the ever-evolving universe at my fingertips, I don’t need a path set by man or previous failures when I can navigate by the stars.
### Living life to the Fullest 
It’s all about the breaths you take. I’ve seen some babies only get to take a few, and seen people who lived over 100 years take their last. A last breath is a last breath. There’s no re-dos after that. Nobody gets to know how many breaths they have left, or knows how many anybody has left. Just one minute you start breathing after erupting from your mother’s womb. And then one minute, you stop breathing, and become a corpse. It’s an evitable chain of events. If you take a breath, you’ll eventually stop after so many and transform from animate to inanimate, just like you were before you became what you ate.
