### The Queen of Thorns's Plan
Olenna Tyrell, known as the Queen of Thorns, was unwilling to let her granddaughter Margaery marry King Joffrey Baratheon. She had heard stories of Joffrey's cruel nature from Littlefinger's men who came from King's Landing. Olenna knew that Joffrey would eventually beat Margaery, and that would lead to war between House Tyrell and House Lannister. In order to protect Margaery, Olenna decided to eliminate the threat that was Joffrey.

### A Deadly Alliance is Formed
Littlefinger, ever the opportunist, saw that the Queen of Thorns was unwilling to let the Tyrell-Lannister alliance proceed unless Joffrey was removed. He approached Olenna with a plan to [assassinate the king at his own wedding](https://yt.io.vn/collection/alejandre). Littlefinger told Olenna that with Joffrey out of the way, the Lannisters would have no choice but to wed Margaery to Joffrey's younger brother Tommen instead. Tommen was seen as gentle and easily controlled, unlike Joffrey. Olenna agreed to Littlefinger's plan, and their deadly alliance was formed.
### Poison on the Necklace  
Littlefinger hired a man known as the "fool" of King Joffrey to deliver a **poison-laced necklace** to Sansa Stark, who was to wed Tyrion Lannister. At the wedding feast, as Joffrey took ill, Olenna discreetly approached Sansa and removed the small vial containing the poison from within Sansa's necklace. She then covertly emptied the poison into the late king's wine. As Joffrey clutched at his throat, choking on the poison, chaos erupted at the feast.
### Setting up the Scapegoats
With Joffrey's assassinatoin complete, Littlefinger had the fool whisk Sansa away to safety. He then sailed with Sansa, removing her from the scene of the crime. Meanwhile, Tyrion Lannister was framed for the murder due to his own hatred of Joffrey. The **Lannister-Tyrell alliance** proceeded as planned, with Margaery set to marry the new king, Tommen. Littlefinger and Olenna Tyrell's betrayal went undiscovered, and they had eliminated the threat of Joffrey.
### The New King and Queen
Margaery Tyrell was quickly wed to young King Tommen after Joffrey's death. With Tommen on the throne and under Margaery's influence, the **Tyrell power in King's Landing** was stronger than ever. Cersei Lannister was enraged at both her son's death and the loss of her House's authority. She began to scheme ways to put House Lannister back in power over the throne and over King's Landing. However, with Littlefinger and Olenna's machinations, the alliance between the Lannisters and Tyrells continued for the time being.
### The Master of Whispers Works Behind the Scenes
As for Littlefinger, with his role in Joffrey's murder unknown, he was able to rise further in influence. His skills at **manipulation and intrigue** served him well in King's Landing. Through his network of spies and his position on the Small Council, Littlefinger continued to work behind the scenes, playing all the great Houses off one another. His long term plans moved ever closer to fruition with the assassination of Joffrey and the new status quo in the capital under Tommen and Margaery's rule.
