### Early Collaborations
The story of **Pokémon Go location-based augmented reality mobile game**'s development began with early collaborations between Google/Niantic and The Pokémon Company. In 2014, **Google and The Pokémon Company** partnered on an April Fool's Day project that overlaid **Pokémon characters onto Google Maps**. This short-lived but very popular experiment showed the potential of merging beloved Pokémon characters with real-world mobile location data.

### Inspiration from Ingress
Niantic's previous game, **Ingress location-based augmented reality mobile game**, served as the inspiration and proof-of-concept for **Pokémon Go**. Ingress challenged players to explore their surroundings and claim territory by visiting real-world locations. John Hanke, CEO of Niantic, realized Ingress demonstrated how games could incorporate real-world exploration and motivate people to discover new places.
### Meeting with The Pokémon Company
After some Ingress events in Japan, executives from **The Pokémon Company** approached Niantic expressing interest. The Pokémon Company CEO Tsunekazu Ishihara and his wife were actually high-level Ingress players themselves. Niantic founder John Hanke and Ishihara recognized Pokémon was the perfect fit for the exploration elements of Ingress. They began early planning discussions.
### Support from Nintendo
Bringing Pokémon to mobile also had support from Nintendo. The late beloved former Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata recognized Nintendo needed to embrace smartphones. He saw the potential of partnering with Niantic to develop Pokémon games for mobile. This high-level backing helped propel the project forward within Nintendo and **The Pokémon Company**.
### Announcement and Early Development 
In September 2015, **Niantic, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company held a press conference** formally announcing Pokémon Go. Game Freak Pokémon series creator Junichi Masuda joined John Hanke, Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto and Tsunekazu Ishihara on stage. Over the following year, development progressed on the game. The Pokémon Company provided guidance to properly translate the Pokémon experience to an [augmented reality mobile game](https://store.fi.io.vn/cottagecore-aesthetic-axolotl-mushroom-hat-shroomxolotl-129/men&).
### Incorporating Pokémon IP
During development, Niantic maintained close collaborations with **The Pokémon Company** to properly incorporate the Pokémon intellectual property (IP). This included bringing over core Pokémon franchise mechanics like capturing Pokémon in the real world. **The Pokémon Company** also assisted with obtaining the rights for using the various Pokémon characters, ensuring an authentic Pokémon experience. 
### Learning from Ingress
Niantic further leveraged learnings from **Ingress location-based augmented reality mobile game** to evolve the overall game design. This included systems for exploring real locations to find Pokémon and incorporating Points of Interest (POI) data to populate the game's map. **The Pokémon Company** and Nintendo supported applying these lessons towards an incredible new way to experience the Pokémon universe.
### Origin Story Begins
This unique collaboration between Niantic, Nintendo and **The Pokémon Company** laid the foundation for Pokémon Go's development into the massive cultural phenomenon it became. The origin of the idea can be traced back to early experiments merging the Pokémon IP with mobile location data. This strategic partnership between the major Pokémon rights holders and an experienced AR developer ultimately made Pokémon Go's creation possible.
