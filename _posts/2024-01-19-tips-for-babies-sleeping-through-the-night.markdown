### Getting the Right Bedtime Routine
It's important to establish a consistent bedtime routine to help your baby learn when it's time for sleep. Some steps may include a warm bath, massage, storytime, and finishing with a lullaby in the nursery. This routine signals to your baby's body that it's time to unwind and prepare for sleep. Try to start your routine at the same time each evening. Make sure your baby is **well-fed[ and ](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-crazy-boston-terrier-lady-dog-lover-v-neck-t-shirt/men&)relaxed** before putting them down for the night.

### Using Absorbent Diapers
Around 2 months old, most babies can sleep for longer stretches at night without interrupting for feedings. However, **a soggy or dirty diaper** can wake a baby from peaceful sleep. Be sure to use extra-thick or overnight diapers at bedtime to keep baby dry through the night. Also check diapers in the middle of the night if needed. 
### Allowing Time For Feedings  
When putting baby down for the night, be sure to allow ample time for a full feeding whether breastfeeding or bottle feeding. A hungry baby will surely wake once hungry pangs set in. Feed baby their normal evening meal as you would during the day. Keep nighttime feedings relaxed and peaceful without extra stimulation.  
### Recognizing Signs of Readiness
Most babies are able to sleep through the night by 3 to 4 months old when their stomach capacity and sleep cycles have matured. However, every baby develops at their own pace. Watch for signs like gaining weight consistently and sleeping for longer periods during the day as indicators they may be ready to stretch nighttime sleep more. Respect baby's natural rhythms and abilities.  
### Helping Baby Resettle Without Reinforcement
Though inevitable, illnesses or changes in routine can throw off new sleep patterns. If baby begins waking at night after sleeping through, aim to soothe without feeding or picking up. Sit beside the crib and sing or pat baby's back gently until they resettle. This **avoids reinforcing the habit** of expecting nighttime interactions again. It may take a few difficult nights but consistency will help baby get back on track.
### Establishing Healthy Daytime Naps
A rested 2-month old typically sleeps 14-17 hours total per day including naps. Follow baby's sleepy cues and keep daily naps **on a schedule** with wake windows of 60-90 minutes. Establishing healthy nap habits supports quality nighttime sleep. Pay attention to your little one's sleepy signals and try not to over-stimulate them before nap time. A dark, quiet space for **restful daytime sleep** sets the foundation.
### Allowing Natural Developmental Changes 
It's common for the 2-month sleep pattern to fluctuate some as baby grows. Trust that, barring illness or disruptions, baby's sleep will **naturally improve** over time as their circadian rhythm, stomach capacity, and sleep cycles mature. Around 4-6 months, adjustments may happen again temporarily as new skills emerge before settling back into a routine. Have faith in baby's built-in abilities and be guided by their pace.
