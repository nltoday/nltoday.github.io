## Parity with High-End PCs 
The GPUs in the next generation Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 consoles will offer around the same level of performance as today's Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 graphics card. This makes them comparable to many high-end gaming PCs currently on the market. However, console hardware is tuned differently than PCs in order to optimize performance within the thermal and power constraints of their form factors. 
## Zen 2 CPUs and RDNA 2 GPUs
Both new consoles will utilize AMD's latest [Zen 2 CPU](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-xmas-light-gift-for-chihuahua-lover-dog-lover-gift-idea4424-t-shirt) architecture found in their Ryzen 3000 desktop processors. This will provide significant gains in performance and efficiency over the Jaguar-based CPUs in the current Xbox One and PS4. The graphics hardware is also getting a big upgrade with **RDNA 2-based GPUs** that promise much higher performance and support for **ray tracing** compared to the GCN architectures they replace.
## Big Navi Brings RTX 2080 Power to Consoles
Recent analysis of the specs for Microsoft's Xbox Series X revealed some key details about the next-gen **AMD RDNA 2 "Big Navi" GPU** inside. At 12 teraflops of compute power and supported by 16GB of GDDR6 RAM, Digital Foundry estimates its performance to be on par with an RTX 2080. The 52 compute units clocked at 1.825GHz help achieve this while also supporting hardware-accelerated **ray tracing**. This bodes well for the power of standalone desktop "Big Navi" cards to truly compete at the high-end against Nvidia.
### Bringing PC-Level Features to Consoles 
Consoles have traditionally lagged behind high-end gaming PCs in terms of raw graphics performance. However, the new generation brings features like ray tracing previously only seen on Nvidia's RTX cards to mainstream console gamers. If developers optimize their engines to take full advantage, we could see a notable leap in visual quality for console games compared to those on current-gen hardware.

### Underclocked for Thermals and Affordability
Though on par with RTX 2080, the console APUs will likely not reach the same clock speeds as their desktop PC counterparts. Manufacturers underclock components to stay within tight thermal and power constraints of consoles housed in small form factors. Lower clocks don't necessarily mean a big performance hit, however, due to the ability to optimize software for the static console hardware.
## Discrete Graphics Bring Console Power to PCs
With so-called **Big Navi** looking capable of matching an RTX 2080, the discrete desktop graphics cards based on RDNA 2 architecture have potential to set a new price/performance standard. If priced competitively, they could win over many gamers who felt AMD lacked a true high-end alternative to Nvidia's top GPUs. Landing anywhere close to an RTX 2080's level while beating it on price would make RDNA 2 discrete graphics very compelling options.
### Enthusiasts Anticipate Ray Tracing Performance 
Perhaps the biggest unknown is how well AMD's ray tracing implementation performs relative to Nvidia. Initial tests of Xbox Series X games running the feature look promising. But PC enthusiasts will want to see independent benchmarks of desktop-class RDNA 2 graphics cards. If AMD proves competitive on **ray traced** visuals while retaining good traditional rasterization performance, it could steal sales away from Nvidia's Turing-based RTX lineup even at similar or greater prices.
## The Potential of Super-Sampling at Lower Resolutions
While consoles typically target higher resolutions like 4K nowadays, doing so at high frame rates with all the eye candy enabled remains difficult even for high-end PCs. The new hardware may be able to hit 4K/60Hz with compromises, but could also excel at techniques like **super-sampling** from lower resolutions to upscale to 4K/2K displays. Supersampling helps reduce aliasing artifacts while also lessening the workload on the GPU. This is an area consoles often surpass comparable gaming PCs.
### Accessible High-End Visuals
If supported well by developers, super-sampling could deliver a top-notch visual experience at resolutions like 1440p on consoles that remains smooth at 60+fps. Meanwhile, the same games may chug at real 4K on good gaming PCs. This would further close the visual gap between consoles and PCs, making the premium console versions the best option for AAA blockbuster gaming on many mainstream HDTVs and monitors.
## Console and PC Convergence Continues 
The new Xbox and PlayStation clearly aim to match or surpass high-end gaming PCs in terms of raw graphics muscle. They also adopt many capabilities like ray tracing previously exclusive to high-end discrete graphics cards. This continued convergence makes multi-platform game development financially appealing, simultaneously feeding more top-tier titles to both console and PC audiences. For gamers, it means the premium experiences traditionally limited to expensive gaming PCs will be playable on mainstream living room devices.
