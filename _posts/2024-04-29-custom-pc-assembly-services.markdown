I've had good experiences with both KSP and Ivory for custom PC assembly in Israel. KSP built the desktop computer I'm currently using, which allows you to pick components and have them handle assembly. This gives the benefit of a custom PC without worrying about part compatibility or assembly yourself. [Ivory also offers this custom PC assembly service](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/corgi), allowing you to get exactly the computer you want without the hassle of building it yourself. When factoring in costs like shipping, VAT, and compatibility, using one of these assembly services often works out to be around the same price as buying parts individually from places like Amazon or Newegg.
### Overall Best Options for Different Product Types
For mainstream ready-made electronics like laptops, phones, tablets, and other consumer devices, **Ivory is generally the best option in Israel**. They have many physical store locations for easy shopping and trying products in person. Ivory also offers reliable service and tend to have competitive prices compared to alternatives once you include VAT and shipping from overseas. However, **KSP can sometimes have lower prices for some products** and wider selection, but their service has been subpar in my experience. 
For custom PC builds or niche technology products where you want highly customized options, I often use smaller local stores even if they are slightly more expensive. Geographic proximity is important for things like being able to easily return or get support for niche or DIY products. These local specialists typically have more expertise and options for customized solutions compared to large retailers focused mainly on mass market items.

### Finding Specialty Electronics Stores 
If you need specialty electronics components or hobbyist equipment, one good option is to check near university areas. University students often have interest and demand for niche technology products. As a result, you'll sometimes find small stores catering to those needs located near college campuses. Larger malls also occasionally have hobby shops worth checking that may carry specialty electronics. Hardware stores in semi-industrial or industrial zones can be good places to find things like electrical components, motors, and specialty tools if you need them. 
### Best Place to Buy Appliances
Zap is a good starting point to research appliance prices online in Israel. However, for major purchases like fridges, stoves, washers and dryers, I recommend going to one of the larger privately owned appliance stores instead of chain retailers. The individually owned stores typically have more leverage with the appliance manufacturers since they represent a larger customer base. So they may be able to help more if issues come up after purchase. All major appliance brands tend to be serviced by just one or two companies in Israel as well. Going to the store that services the brand you buy can simplify post-purchase support.
### Finding the Right Electronics Store for Your Needs
In summary, the best electronics stores in Israel can vary depending on the specific products or services needed. Large retailers like Ivory and KSP work well for many mainstream electronics. But for custom builds, niche goods, or major appliances, considering smaller local specialists or independently owned stores is often a better fit. Doing some research into the options near you and reading reviews can help identify the retail partners best equipped to meet your particular technology requirements. Geographic proximity, price, product selection, and anticipated post-purchase support should all factor into selecting the top store.
