### Making Room for Their Wellbeing  
BTS has gained immense popularity globally and with it, comes additional responsibilities and stress. While their music uplifts millions, constant public attention can wear down even the most resilient spirits. As caring fans, our role is to support their work without overstepping personal boundaries. 
With good intentions, contacting or stalking idols directly often backfires. Unbidden interactions interrupt downtime crucial to recharging creativity and health. Instead of connecting, it distances stars from the very people cheering them on. A better way is allowing space so artists feel free and inspired, not confined or on edge.
