Mike was a recent graduate from UC Berkeley in the 1960s when The Graduate novel and movie came out. As a lost graduate trying to find his way, he could deeply relate to the character of Ben. 
While he found Ben and Elaine's young love sympathetic, he had mixed feelings about Mrs. Robinson's character. On one hand, he understood her unhappiness in a forced marriage drove her actions. However, her attempt to sabotage Ben and Elaine's relationship seemed misguided. 
Three movie endings throughout his life left Mike with lingering bitterness that still surfaced decades later. While changes were sometimes needed to adapt books, completely altering critical plots and themes frustrated him to his core.
### A Graduate's Reflection  
As a new graduate himself in 1964, Mike was drawn to the novel's depiction of post-college uncertainty. Ben's aimlessness and confusion resonated with his own experiences. When the acclaimed film was released, Dustin Hoffman's nuanced performance brought the character to life.
He admired how the story presented each character's perspective in a **sympathetic light without villains.** Mrs. Robinson's unhappy marriage explained though not excuse her actions. Her husband reacted understandably on limited knowledge yet still caused harm. Both works highlighted life's complexity without oversimplifying moral lines.

### A Complex Mrs. Robinson  
While able to understand Mrs. Robinson's unhappiness driving her actions, Mike disagreed with her sabotaging Ben and Elaine's relationship. As the audience, he saw their love develop authentically. However, from her perspective, she knew Ben primarily through their physical affair.
This created [an inherent mismatch between how different characters experience the same events](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/alejandre). Mike was fascinated by how this dynamic played out and the insights it provided into human behavior. However, altering the novel's ending to depict Mr. Robinson as "evil" weakened this nuanced portrayal.
### Pressure Problems in The Abyss
A few years later, Mike was deeply immersed in The Abyss on the edge of his seat until a jarring plot hole punched through. The crew's implantation miraculously facing no pressure or decompression issues made no logical sense given preceding events. 
While the director tried patching this in extended cuts, the damage was done. For Mike, **big budget films should maintain internal consistency or risk losing the audience**. He felt cheated by such a glaring oversight undermining the entire story and technical realism built up to that point.
### Altering Literary Classics 
Nothing frustrated Mike more than adaptations that significantly changed source material's core themes and endings. The Count of Monte Cristo was a lifelong favorite until versions pairing Dantes with Mercedes. This completely erased the character's journey of vengeance and redemption.
Similarly, Circle of Friends abruptly having Benny take Jack back betrayed her empowering character development. Mike believed **faithful adaptations honor the original workâ€™s spirit rather than distorting it for Hollywood formulas**. Small changes were acceptable but not at the cost of thematic integrity.
### The Unforgivable Curse of a Weak Wand Plot
As someone who devoured the Harry Potter books, Mike looked forward to the film series but watched Deathly Hallows Part 2 with mounting dismay. The climactic battle lacked the book's intensity while acceptable directorial choices were the least of issues. 
The **critical symbolic relationship between Harry and his wand, and its destruction enabling use of the Elder Wand, was entirely omitted without replacement**. For Mike, this constituted the "Notus Fixingus the Wand" unforgivable movie curse, souring the entire franchise's conclusion. Leaving such a gaping plot hole ruined the story's emotional payoff.
### Persistent Bitterness from Betrayals of Source Material  
Decades later, the changed endings in these three adaptations still left bitterness in Mike that arose whenever he reflected on them. While suspension of disbelief is needed in any adaptation, changing plot points that undermine themes or neglect fundamental character journeys crossed an unacceptable line.
He believed that **faithfulness to source material showed respect for the original creators' vision rather than pandering to perceived audience expectations**. Even with inevitable cuts and edits, the core spirit and conclusion should remain intact to avoid betrayal. Mike hoped future adaptations learned from these past mistakes in navigating creative license.
