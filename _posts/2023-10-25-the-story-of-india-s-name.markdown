India's name has a long and interesting history dating back thousands of years to the ancient Sanskrit name "Bharata". Let's break down the evolution of India's name through the ages in multiple parts.
### Rivers and Civilizations
[Ancient river civilizations](https://yt.io.vn/collection/agosta) like the Indus Valley Civilization flourished along major rivers in the region from around 3300 BC. The Indus River, known as Sindhu in Sanskrit, gave its name to an entire grouping of rivers called "Sapta Sindhu" or "Seven Rivers". People and culture around the Sindhu River came to be called Sindhu as well.

### Persian Influence  
As Persians conquered parts of northwest India and established trade routes, they pronounced Sindhu with an 'h' sound as "Hindu". The land of Hindus thus became known as "Hindustan". This Persian influence spread the name Hindu and Hindustan far and wide through their traders.
### Greek Interpretations
By the 5th century BC, the region was known to the invading Persians as "Hindus" and to the Greek historian Herodotus as "Indos". The Romans adopted the Greek name "India" to refer to the entire subcontinent. This was simplified from earlier Greek renditions like "Indike" which were attempts to capture the native Sanskrit names.
### Ancient Scriptures and Epics  
Our early Hindu scriptures referenced the land as "Jambudvipa", literally meaning the 'Island of Jambu trees' which described prehistoric geography. Later Vedic texts called it "Bharatavarsha", named after the legendary emperor Bharata. This early name may have included parts of modern Bangladesh, Pakistan and more.
### Regional Diversity
As different kingdoms and dynasties rose and fell over centuries, regional identities also developed. The northwest, entry point for foreign invasions, was most commonly called "Hindustan". While the south distinguished itself with names like "Dravida" and the east as "Kalinga". But these were assimilated under the overarching term "Bharata".
### British Influence and Beyond
The modern name "India" gained widespread global recognition and use during British colonial rule from the 16th century. Even after independence in 1947, our constitution recognizes the ancient name "Bharat" alongside "India". Today both names are used officially to celebrate our roots and rich history behind the modern identity of the world's largest democracy.
