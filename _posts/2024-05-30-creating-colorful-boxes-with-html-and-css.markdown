### Defining the Container
To get started, we first need to define the container which will hold our colored box. In HTML, we can use a `<div>` element to act as a container. Make sure to give the `<div>` a unique identifier like a `class` or `id` attribute so we can target it with CSS. For example:
```html
<div id="colored-box"></div>
```

### Applying Styles with CSS
Next, we link to a stylesheet and select the `<div>` using its identifier to apply styles. **The background-color property is used to fill the box with color.** We can specify colors by name, hex code, RGB values or other formats. For a red box: 
```css
#colored-box {
background-color: red;
}
```
### Controlling the Box Size
To control the visible size of the box, we set the width and height properties. This defines the dimensions of the filled area. For a 150px square:
```css
#colored-box {
width: 150px;
height: 150px;
} 
```
### Adding Borders and Padding
Borders and padding can help style the box further. A thin black border is added with border property. Padding clears an interior space AWAY from the border:
```css 
#colored-box {
border: 1px solid black;
padding: 10px;
}
```
### Customizing Box Appearance
Now that the basic structure and styling is defined, we can build on it. Additional properties allow control over text alignment, margins and more. Play around to create uniquely styled boxes!
### Using Color Boxes on a Page
With the CSS styles defined, we can use the `<div>` multiple times on our page simply by repeating the HTML element. Each instance can have its own identifier, class, color and dimensions. 
```html
<div class="red-box"></div>
<div class="blue-box"></div> 
```
### Adjusting Box Layouts
CSS also provides control over box layout positioning. The float property floats elements, while clear establishes flow. This allows creative multicolor layout designs on the page.
### Browser Compatibility 
Basic color box functionality works well across all modern browsers. For older browser support, alternative methods like table layouts can fill the same role with reduced flexibility. Always test layouts in various browsers!
### Future Enhancements
As CSS continues advancing, new specifications offer enhanced color control. Features like opacity, gradients and blend modes unlock exciting design possibilities. Combined with animations, color boxes open a world of creative possibilities!
