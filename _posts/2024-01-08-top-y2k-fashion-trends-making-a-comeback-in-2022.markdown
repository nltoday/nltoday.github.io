Fashion trends have this fascinating ability to come back in style after decades. One trend that has taken the industry by storm yet again is Y2K fashion. Characterised by edgy silhouettes and playful prints from the late 90s to early 2000s, Y2K fashion is dominating runways and closets in 2022. With mini skirts, cropped tops, and low-rise jeans returning, here are some of the top Y2K trends worth embracing this year.
### Mini Skirts
Micro-mini skirts that dare to hit above the knee are the epitome of Y2K fashion. These playful skirts allow one to show some skin after months spent in loungewear during the pandemic. Taking inspiration from Miu Miu's Spring/Summer 2022 collection showcasing mini A-line skirts in fun prints and bright hues, dare to shine in a mini this season. Pair these daring pieces with knee-high boots, strappy sandals or chunky sneakers.

### Cropped Tops 
Crop tops that showcase midriffs in creative designs continue to rule runways and Instagram feeds. Following Dua Lipa's example, opt for twists on the classic crop like tops shaped as flowers or butterflies. Layer cropped shirts over camisoles or pair them with high-waisted bottoms. For a y2k upgrade, consider styles decorated with charms, rings or lettering. 
### Low-Rise Jeans
The early 2000s were all about jeans dangerously close to showing one's undies, and low-rise jeans are experiencing a revival. Opt for styles cut to sit an inch or two below the belly button for an authentic Y2K feel. Distressed, ripped or acid-washed washes add to the vintage vibe. Tuck these jeans into boots or pair with cropped tanks to accentuate your waist. 
### Cargo Pants
Cargo pants had their moment in the late 90s and are making noise again with their utility-inspired designs. Treat your cargo pants like a statement piece by opting for styles featuring multiple pockets, drawstrings, straps or buckles in bold colours. Layer them under mini dresses, pair with crop tops or throw on an oversized button-down for a laidback Y2K inspired look. 
### Platform Shoes 
Platform shoes are back and bolder than ever. First popularized in the 90s, these shoes add instant edge and height to any outfit. Opt for styles with thick soles in pop colours or prints like neon, animal or tie-dye patterns. Balance the statement shoes with more classic pieces above for a fun Y2K twist. Platform sandals and boots allow one to embrace the trend through different seasons too.
### Denim Jackets   
Denim jackets have long been a wardrobe staple but the Y2K era took them to new heights. Distressed, embroidered, beaded or patched styles add personality. Channel the double denim trend through matching denim separates or layer jackets over dresses in contrasting washes. Invest in a stellar denim or jean jacket to take any look to the next level this season. 
### Statement Bags
It would not be Y2K fashion without quirky, attention-grabbing bags. Top contenders are unapologetically large totes, bucket bags especially in crocodile textures, bejeweled purses and of course, beloved baguette bags. Bold prints, charms and mixed materials add uniqueness. Carry your pick in the crook of your arm or let it hang casually from the shoulder for an effortless finish to any Y2K-inspired ensemble. 
### Sunglasses 
No Y2K inspired look is complete without a pair of statement sunnies. Cat-eye, oversized round or shield styles decorated in crystals, logos or studs add the perfect finishing touch. Opt for mirrored or photo chromic lenses in dramatic frames featuring pops of colour, logos or crystals. Sunglasses serve to round out any Y2K outfit whilst serving necessary sun protection too.
