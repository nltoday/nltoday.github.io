### Evaluating Software Options and Budgets 
University and company stakeholders must consider many factors when selecting process simulation software. **Two vital considerations are licensing costs and availability for their intended uses.** While corporate licenses tend to be more expensive, academic prices provide affordable access for educational purposes. Negotiating discounts could unlock cost savings.

### Cost Ranges Depend on User Type and Package Features
Overall, **HYSYS steady-state and dynamic licenses range from around $20,000 to over $50,000 annually for commercial clients.** The price depends on package details, such as whether dynamic simulation is included. Universities may obtain licenses for a small fraction of these amounts by applying through department heads. **Student and research applications that further process engineering are usually supported through academic discounts.**
### Academic Prices Vary Globally Considering University Resources
The academic licensing costs offered also differ depending on the university's location and research profile. **HYSYS pricing structures take national economic factors into account to promote process simulation education worldwide.** For example, licenses may cost $1,000â€“$2,000 USD annually at universities in developing nations. Well-funded institutions pay closer to the $20,000 endpoint. **These flexible academic prices boost accessibility relative to institutional budgets.**
