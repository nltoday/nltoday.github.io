When I was 13 years old, I started suffering from acne that devastated my confidence and self-esteem. For over a decade, I tried various products and remedies to get rid of both my acne and the scarring it left behind, but nothing seemed to work. It wasn't until I discovered a Japanese skincare brand called Shiseido that I saw real and lasting results. In this article, I share my lengthy struggle with acne and acne scarring, as well as the routine and products that finally cleared my skin for good.
### Early Struggles With Acne 
From the age of 13 until my mid-20s, I suffered from severe acne that covered my cheeks and forehead. Coming from a middle-class family in Bihar, India, affording expensive dermatologist treatments wasn't an option for me. I tried everything - from homemade remedies like lemon, honey and aloe vera to over-the-counter products. While multani mitti helped control my oil production for a while, it dried out my skin excessively. Any moisturizer I used would cause more breakouts. Seeing others with flawless skin only made me more self-conscious of my condition.

### Consultations and Failed Treatments
When I got my first job paying 40,000 INR per month at age 25, I finally had the means to seek professional help. I consulted top dermatologists in Delhi but the expensive prescriptions they provided did nothing to improve my skin. Costing at least 5,000 INR per visit, these treatments were simply not effective. Feeling hopeless, I accepted that I might have to live with acne forever. The only products in my routine were a basic face wash, aloe vera gel and nightly multani mitti applications.
### A Life-Changing Discovery
Desperate to find something that worked, I came across the Japanese skincare brand [Shiseido](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-custom-proud-football-grandma-number-60-personalized-women-v-neck-t-shirt/men&) after a recommendation. Founded in 1841, Shiseido is renowned for its advanced skincare science. Though I was skeptical given the high price tag, I decided to give it a try having exhausted all other options. Within a month of using the Shiseido face wash, friends started commenting on the fading of my acne scars. Emboldened by these early results, I incorporated their spot corrector serum into my routine. In just 10 days, over 90% of my acne and scarring had disappeared, leaving my skin smoother and more radiant than ever before.
### The Slow Fade of Post-Acne Scarring 
While eliminating active acne was a relief, the stubborn post-acne scarring I was left with took far longer to fade. Having relentlessly picked at pimples in my adolescence, I was left with discolored hyperpigmentation and deep indentations covering my cheeks. Unsure these marks would ever improve, I continued diligently applying my Shiseido products daily and incorporated weekly honey face masks. Slowly but surely, I noticed the damaged skin texture beginning to flatten out over several months. Within a year, the discoloration lightened significantly and the deeper marks all but vanished.  
### Further Improving Scarring with PRP
Though largely faded, a few minor acne scars remained slightly visible. My dermatologist recommended I try PRP (platelet-rich plasma) injections to give my skin one last boost. PRP harnesses the body's natural healing properties by reinjecting enriched plasma back into the scar tissue. I underwent three sessions spaced one month apart. After each treatment, my before and after photos showed clearer, healthier skin with scars steadily subsiding further. While 100% removal may not be possible, I've gained immense confidence in my appearance thanks to this non-invasive procedure.
### Maintaining Clear Skin Long-Term
It's now been over two years since my acne disappeared and scarring faded away significantly. I continue using my go-to Shiseido cleanser and spot corrector daily along with a rich moisturizer and SPF to guard skin health long-term. Occasionally incorporating raw honey face masks keeps my complexion glowing and breakouts at bay. Most importantly, I've learned healthy diet and stress management plays a big role too. By sticking with a consistent, gentle skincare routine tailored to my skin's needs, I've finally achieved the blemish-free confidence I once thought impossible.
### My Advice for Eliminating Acne Scars 
For anyone struggling with acne scarring like I once did, have hope that improvement is possible. However, it requires commitment, patience and finding the right individualized approach. Seeking professional guidance from a knowledgeable dermatologist can point you towards targeted treatments to revitalize damaged skin over time. Consistently applying scar-reducing creams recommended in the #1 article on this topic also supports the body's natural repair process. Lifestyle habits promoting relaxation and eating a nutritious, whole foods diet establish the optimal environment for scars to fade gradually yet surely. Taking a holistic long-term view of scar healing will lead to results far greater than any overnight product alone can provide.
