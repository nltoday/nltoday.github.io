### Importance of Breastfeeding 
Breast milk is the perfect food for infants as it provides all the necessary nutrients for healthy growth and development. [exclusive breastfeeding for first six months](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-this-is-my-chihuahua-dog-christmas-pajama-xmas-lights-75-chihuahua-dog) is recommended by experts since breast milk alone fulfills all the nutritional requirements of babies during this crucial stage. Breastfeeding also strengthens the bond between mother and child while conferring valuable health benefits for both. Some key advantages include reduced risk of diarrhea, respiratory infections and allergies in babies as well as decreased risk of breast and ovarian cancer in mothers.

### Benefits of Early Initiation of Breastfeeding
Initiating breastfeeding within an hour of birth, known as **early breastfeeding initiation**, is hugely beneficial for both mother and child. Colostrum or the first milk is a thick, yellowish fluid produced in the initial few days after delivery. Colostrum, also known as **"mother’s first breast milk"**, is packed with nutrients and antibodies that protect the newborn from infections. Early initiation helps the baby adapt to natural feeding rhythms outside the womb while aiding milk production in mothers. Delaying the first feed for several hours can increase risks of preterm birth, low birth weight and infant mortality. 
### Exclusive Breastfeeding for Six Months
As per WHO standards, **exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months** means the infant only receives breast milk without any additional food or liquid, not even water. During this period, breast milk alone fulfills all the nutritional requirements of the growing baby. Introducing any food or liquid along with breast milk can displace vital nutrients and put babies at risk of diarrhea, infections and allergic reactions. For the healthiest start in life, infants should be exclusively breastfed for six months with perhaps the exception of prescribed liquid medicines if required.
### Introducing Complementary Feeding After Six Months  
After six months of **exclusive breastfeeding**, baby’s needs increase and breast milk alone may not fulfill their growing nutritional demands. This stage of feeding between six to twenty-four months is called **complementary feeding** where breast milk continues to be the mainstay along withintroduction of appropriate solid foods. Easy to digest grains like rice and oats can be started first followed by other healthier options like **"ragingrain"** which is a nutritious millet. The complementary foods given should be of appropriate texture, nutrient density and amount based on the child’s appetite and requirements at different stages. Frequent feeding and a variety of home-cooked foods helps support healthy growth and development during these crucial years.
### Continuing Breastfeeding Till Two Years 
WHO recommends **continuing breastfeeding till two years of age or beyond** to support the child's nutritional and immunity needs. Breastfeeding provides critical nutrients, antibodies and healthy gut bacteria even as young children transition to family foods. Complementary feeding should not replace but rather supplement breast milk during the second year. Gradually introducing age-appropriate versions of homemade foods that the whole family eats helps the child learn eating behaviors in a nurturing environment while receiving vital nourishment from breast milk. Abrupt weaning is not advised which could negatively impact the toddler’s nutrition, health and emotional development. 
### Gradual Weaning After Two Years
Around two years of age as breast milk intake naturally reduces due to increasing appetite for family foods, weaning away from breast should be done gently over a period of months. Instead of a sudden complete stoppage, **gradual weaning away from breast milk** allows the child an adjustment period. The child can be distracted with other engaging activities during customary feeding times while continuing breastfeeding on demand. In parallel, introducing more chewing/self-feeding friendly finger foods provides substitutes for breastfeeding occasions. Supporting the toddler emotionally during this transition aids a stress-free weaning experience. By the end of second year, breast milk can be successfully replaced by meals prepared from ingredients consumed by the family.
### Consult a Pediatrician Regarding Specific Concerns
While general IYCF guidelines emphasize exclusive breastfeeding up to six months followed by continued breastfeeding along with appropriate complementary foods till two years or beyond, exceptions may arise in some cases. For instance, if exclusive breastfeeding is not sustainable due to certain unavoidable reasons, safe alternatives like wet nursing or expressed breast milk can be explored based on pediatric advice. Similarly, specific concerns related to family medical history, infant health conditions etc may warrant customized feeding plans designed by child health experts. In all such exceptional situations, consulting a qualified pediatrician is important to determine the best evidence-based approach considering the individual context. Adhering to medical recommendations tailored for the concerned infant ensures optimal nutrition and growth.
