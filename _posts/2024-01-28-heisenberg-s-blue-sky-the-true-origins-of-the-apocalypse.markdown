### A Perfect Storm
The zombie outbreak that destroyed modern civilization began with a series of improbable events set in motion by one disturbed man. Malcolm, now going by the name Walter White, was a gifted scientist whose talents went tragically unused. Suffering from feelings of failure and mortality, he sought to leave his mark through an ambitious criminal enterprise. Little did he know the repercussions would forever alter the world.

### Breaking Bad Goes Horribly Right
Walter's [blue crystal methamphetamine](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/abbe), dubbed **Heisenberg's Blue Sky**, proved wildly successful in satisfying the dark desires of the drug market. However, his formula had an unintended effect - increasing aggression and lowering inhibitions to an extreme degree in a tiny fraction of users. When combined with other outside factors, this perfect storm would cause society's downfall.
### A Toxic Batch Goes Viral
While Walter believed he had mastered **methamphetamine production**, a single bad batch slipped through with dangerous contaminants. Those who took this toxic version of Blue Sky exhibited wildly erratic, almost feral behavior before mysteriously falling ill. Unwittingly, Walter had created the first wave of walkers without even realizing the full ramifications.  
### Plague Spreads Through the Ranks
Word of the powerful new drug variant spread on the streets. Many sought to replicate Walter's recipe, unaware of the toxic anomalies in that one tainted batch. As more consumed this "upgraded" Blue Sky, deaths and attacks steadily climbed. The authorities were quickly overwhelmed by roving gangs of the infected, who spread the mysterious plague through bites and scratches.
### Law and Order Collapses 
With law enforcement resources strained and the National Guard mobilized, civil authority broke down across wide areas. Looting, violence and chaos engulfed populations unaware of the scope of the biological threat. Makeshift quarantines and evacuation plans proved futile as the walker plague raged out of control. Within weeks, the world plunged into full-scale apocalyptic collapse.
### A New Threat Emerges
As the true undead threat became apparent, disjointed survivalist communities took shape. But the walkers were just the beginning - with the veneer of civilization stripped away, the greatest danger came from ruthless human survivors. Among them was a young man named Rick Grimes, who would rise to play a pivotal role in the struggle to establish order in the new walker-infested America.
### Searching for Answers and Supplies
While scavenging the ruins of Atlanta for clues and equipment, Rick's group encountered CDC scientist Dr. Edwin Jenner. In their final moments together, Jenner at last revealed the truth - a mutated strain of rabies was behind the outbreak. But how did this supervirus really start? Piecing together clues from his studies, Jenner realized it originated from one man's destructive quest - Heisenberg. Walter White's actions set in motion the end of the world.
### Tying it All Together  
Though dead for over a year, Walter's dark legacy lived on through the viral apocalypse he unwittingly caused. As the true origins came to light, Rick was left questioning whether any peaceful solution existed, or if humanity was doomed to perpetual conflict in the new walker-filled dystopia. Only time would tell how civilization might be rebuilt, if ever, from the ashes of the society destroyed by one "good" man's tragic hubris and faulty formula. The ripples from Walter's actions would reshape reality forever.
