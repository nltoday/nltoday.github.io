## Finding Deals Online but Facing Hidden Fees and Policies
I came across BOOKVIP's website while searching for affordable family vacations. Their advertised rates seemed like great deals, often [hundreds of dollars less](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-holiday-funny-santa-shetland-sheepdog-christmas-tree-2) than other sites. After reading positive reviews, I booked a trip, thinking I found a bargain. 
However, upon making my payment, I learned their "free cancellation" policy wasn't really free. I would only receive a partial refund as credit toward a future booking. This was misleading, as nothing mentioned non-refundable fees during the booking process. 
### Dealing with Mandatory Timeshare Presentations  
The resort also mandated attendees of their **multi-hour timeshare presentation** to receive the discounted rates. This was never explicitly stated on BOOKVIP's site. The presentation lasted **over three hours**, wasting half a day we could have spent enjoying our vacation. Persistent sales reps only wanted us to buy, not understand our needs.

## Relying on Third Parties and Lacking Customer Support
To my surprise, BOOKVIP outsourced our reservation to a company called "Monster". When I questioned this, BOOKVIP claimed no knowledge of them. It took **over 20 phone calls** to unravel details between the two companies. BOOKVIP offered no useful assistance, leaving me stressed just before my trip. 
### Missing or Incorrect Reservation Details
Monster also provided incorrect dates and room types multiple times. Constantly calling them for clarification wasted valuable pre-vacation time. BOOKVIP still did not step in to help resolve issues with their third-party partner. 
## Questioning Actual Savings and Recommending Caution
While BOOKVIP advertised **substantial discounts**, mandatory fees soon diminished savings. Taxes were additional costs too. Dealing with hidden strings and lack of customer service caused far more aggravation than any nominal price reduction was worth.
### Doing Thorough Research Before Booking
I advise travelers to thoroughly research any company, read all policies, and understand exactly what is—and isn't—included. Speaking directly with resorts could reveal better options than going through middlemen. BOOKVIP may save a little money, but the ensuing hassle likely outweighs such minor benefits. Proceed cautiously or choose more reputable companies.
## In Summary 
My BOOKVIP experience showed a pattern of obfuscation, outsourcing problems, and prioritizing sales over service. Hidden mandates wasted precious vacation time instead of creating memories. While deals enticed me to book, the ensuing frustration removed any perceived value. I can't recommend risking stress for marginal discounts. Conduct thorough due diligence to avoid similar disappointments.
