A few years ago in high school, I discovered how music has the power to unlock emotions within me. During one study hall period, I was listening to songs on YouTube without paying much attention to the lyrics. That was when I first heard "Fix You" by Coldplay. The lyrics struck a deep chord in me, and for the first time in as long as I could remember, I started crying. It made me realize how music has the ability to profoundly affect us on an emotional level, breaking down the walls we build around our feelings. This discovery led me on a journey of self-reflection about why certain songs make me feel, and what keeps bringing me back to those pieces of music that lift my spirit during difficult times. 
### Discovering My Hidden Emotions
As the Coldplay song played in my ears, I was immediately drawn into the lyrics describing loneliness, loss and the human struggle to cope. Phrases like "when you try your best but you don't succeed" and "when you love someone but it goes to waste" seemed to perfectly capture feelings I had buried deep inside for years. Hearing someone else articulate what I went through in such a beautiful way unleashed the tears I fought so hard to hold back. It was a cathartic release allowing long-suppressed emotions to surface. That experience showed me how impactful music can be in unlocking parts of ourselves we keep hidden, even from our own selves.

### Songs that Uplift My Soul
Over the ensuing years, I began paying closer attention to the kinds of songs that consistently stir my emotions. I noticed they usually share themes of **hope, compassion, human resilience** and the strength of the human spirit. Pieces like "Hallelujah" by Leonard Cohen or "Vienna" by Billy Joel fill me with optimism even during dark times. Their lyrics acknowledge life's hardships but remind us of humanity's capacity for goodness, beauty, love and perseverance. Witnessing suffering but still having faith in brighter days is a sentiment I deeply relate to. Songs imbued with such sentiments never fail to lift my soul and give me solace.
### Finding Solace in Shared Human Experience 
Another thing I've realized is I often get most emotional when a song helps me feel less alone in my struggles or taps into universally human experiences. The commentary sections under such songs are full of people sharing how the music spoke to their lives too. Coming across comments where complete strangers empathize with each other provides comfort in knowing life's pains are commonly felt but not uniquely endured. Such was my experience upon hearing NF's "Paralyzed" which describes emotional numbing, an all-too-familiar coping mechanism. Reading others' comments about similarly relying on detachment to endure inner anguish brought me to tears. In those brief moments of recognition, the heavy burdens lessened knowing we all bear pieces of the same cross. Our shared humanity is what ultimately heals.
### Music as an Expression of the Human Spirit 
Beyond the lyrics and melodies themselves, I'm also deeply touched by the artistry and passion that goes into a musical work's creation. So much of human creativity stems from attempting to articulate life's profoundest questions and experiences in a way that resonates with others. I'm in awe of musicians who pour their hearts and souls into their craft to communicate universal truths through beautifully intricate pieces. Their work affirms humans' ceaseless drive to understand each other and find connection even when words fail. Witnessing such expressions of empathy, compassion and the human drive for meaning often elicits happy tears for me. It renews my faith that for all our flaws, our spirit is inherently geared towards uplifting one another through creativity, empathy and fellowship. That gives me hope that together, we can overcome any challenge.
### Rediscovering Emotional Openness   
Looking back, I realize suppressing emotions was an immature way to cope with perceived vulnerability as a teenager. Now as a young adult, I understand emotions are not a weakness but rather a deep well of wisdom to draw from. Crying in response to profoundly moving music has helped me become more comfortable with emotional transparency. It showed me shutting down my feelings is an unnatural state that limits life experiences. By embracing sensitivity, I've been able to forge closer bonds and gain insights I otherwise would have missed. Music continues reawakening parts of me that once shied from feeling, reminding me to embrace life fully with all its beauty and pain. For that gift, I'll always be grateful.
