When I was born, I was facing my first challenge - I was born blind. But that did not stop me from doing the things I loved. As a child, I enjoyed being active and playing games just like other kids, despite not being able to see. However, as I grew older, I started to internalize the limiting beliefs that others had about what a blind person could or could not do. My perception of my own abilities started to shrink. 
### Realizing My Own Potential
When I turned 15, I decided I had enough of letting others define my limits for me. I made the choice to pursue the things I was passionate about and not let my blindness hold me back. If I failed, then I would learn from it. But I refused to not even try. This change in mindset gave me the confidence to chart my own path.

### Pursing My Dreams of Higher Education  
Against all odds, I pursued my dream of studying mathematics in university. Many said it was [impossible](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-girl-who-loves-scotties-scottish-terrier-dog-breed-owner-1) for a blind person, including some professors. But I persevered and earned my degree. I then decided to study software engineering, which I was told by many would be too difficult. But I proved them wrong by graduating with that degree as well.
### Getting Hired and Building a Career
When I graduated, everyone told me no one would hire a blind person. But I landed a job and have been **successfully working** as a back-end programmer ever since. I have continually grown in my career by gaining new skills and taking on more responsibilities. My accomplishments have shown that with determination, a disabled person can achieve great things in the technology field.
### Overcoming Relationship Trauma
In a previous part of my journey, I faced emotional abuse and trauma from a family member as a child. This caused me to develop trust issues and fear of relationships. For many years, I struggled with the scars this left behind. Through reading self-help books and doing a lot of self-reflection, I was able to start healing. While the wounds may never fully disappear, I've learned important life lessons that have made me stronger.
### Sharing My Story to Inspire Others   
In writing about my experiences and tools I use as a blind programmer, I have connected with many people facing their own challenges. Some are also blind, while others have different disabilities or limitations. By being open about both my struggles and successes, I aim to show that **overcoming adversity** is possible through grit, determination and an unwillingness to give up on your dreams. My story demonstrates that disability does not have to define your potential or limit what you can achieve in life.
### Continuing to Grow and Learn Every Day
My journey of personal growth and Development is far from over. Every new skill I learn, challenge I face, and obstacle I overcome makes me wiser and stronger. While the path has not always been easy, I am proud of how far I've come. I believe the best is still ahead as long as I keep pushing myself to be 1% better each day. My story serves as proof that when you refuse to accept limits placed upon you, the only boundaries are those you set for yourself.
While I was born facing adversity, I have proven that I will not let that define me or hold me back from accomplishing great things. By never giving up on my dreams and refusing to listen to those who said I couldn't do something, I have been able to chart my own course in life. It is my hope that by sharing my story, I can inspire others facing challenges of their own to never give up on themselves or their potential. With hard work and perseverance, **overcoming any obstacle** is possible.
