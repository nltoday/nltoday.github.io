Pacific Mall claims to be an e-commerce platform that allows sellers to open online stores. However, customer reviews suggest that it is actually a scam. 
## Misleading Marketing and Poor Customer Service
Pacific Mall has a professional-looking website with attractive images of products. However, reviews reveal that the actual items received are of very poor quality and badly made. When customers try to return faulty items according to the stated "return policy", [Pacific Mall fails to honor returns](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-girl-moldovan-moldova-flag-unicorn-women-2). 
Customers report that Pacific Mall deliberately delays responding to return requests for weeks. They will only provide discount codes to keep the poor items, rather than issue refunds as promised. This frustrating process goes on endlessly until customers have to contact their credit card companies to get refunds. 
### Ignoring Customers' Concerns
Pacific Mall claims to be based in the UK, but investigations show its real office and warehouse are located in China. Customers who tried to clarify issues found Pacific Mall very unresponsive. Legitimate companies would aim to address customers' problems transparently. Pacific Mall's evasiveness raises red flags.

## Misrepresenting Product Quality 
The photos on Pacific Mall's website picture high-quality items that do not match the shoddy goods received. Reviews complain of **faulty electronic devices**, flawed apparel with loose stitches, and furniture parts arriving broken. Clearly, Pacific Mall misleads buyers about product standards through deceptive marketing images.
### Lack of Authenticity Checks 
Some customers suspected that Pacific Mall sold **counterfeit luxury goods**. Upon closer examination, the logos and designs did not match authentic versions. However, Pacific Mall conducted no authentication process to ensure the legitimacy and safety of items sold on its platform. This carelessness endangers customers.
## Pressure Tactics and Exorbitant Fees 
After opening a basic online store, Pacific Mall tries to upsell sellers to pricier packages. One user said they were expected to pay a USD 130,000 fee or face store "bankruptcy". This predatory tactic seems designed to milk money from unsuspecting victims. 
### Red Flags in Communication 
Surprisingly, all Pacific Mall's correspondence comes from a free Gmail account instead of an official business domain. Combined with its questionable practices, this lack of professionalism raises major doubts about the company's credibility and motives. 
## Dismal Ratings and Warnings 
Customer reviews on platforms like Trustpilot unanimously slam Pacific Mall with one-star ratings. Users recount experiences of poor service, ineffective returns, and unfulfilled promises. This consistent feedback serves as a strong deterrent against engaging with the company. 
### Verify Vendors Thoroughly
Potential buyers must learn from these reviews to investigate any vendors thoroughly before trusting them with money or personal details. Simple checks like verifying company addresses and reviewing multiple ratings platforms can prevent scams. Only work with sellers that have a solid track record of customer satisfaction.
In summary, almost every aspect of Pacific Mall rings alarm bells. Consumers are urged to avoid this questionable operation and patronize sellers with proven integrity and positive customer feedback instead. Due diligence on the front-end saves much frustration down the road.
