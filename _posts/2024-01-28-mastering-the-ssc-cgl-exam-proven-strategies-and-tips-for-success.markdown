### Focus on Quantitative Aptitude 
Roberto emphasizes that quantitative aptitude should be the top priority when preparing for the SSC CGL exam. Solving practice questions from Rakesh Yadav's 9700+ book, dedicating 4-5 hours daily, is recommended to gain mastery over the math concepts tested. Practice is key, as it will help identify weaknesses and areas needing extra focus. Thorough preparation of math is essential, as fewer marks in the general knowledge section can potentially be compensated by scoring well in quantitative reasoning.
