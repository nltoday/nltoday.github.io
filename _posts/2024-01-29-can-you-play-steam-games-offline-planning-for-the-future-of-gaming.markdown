Games have become an important part of our lives as entertainment. However, as gaming becomes more digitally-dependent through platforms like Steam, this raises questions about what could happen if something were to disrupt services like these in the future. In this article, we will explore options for playing Steam games offline, and consider possible scenarios for how gaming may evolve going forward. 
### Keeping Your Game Saves
One key concern is being able to continue playing your games and access your saved progress even if a platform like Steam goes offline. While you cannot play Steam games without an internet connection to verify your license, you can back up and restore your saved game files. Make sure to keep backups of your saved games in a separate location than just on your computer. This way, you have the option to restore them even without being able to launch the games initially.

### Installing "Offline" Backups 
While you cannot play Steam games without authentication, you could theoretically install them in an "offline" or "restore from backup" mode to cut down on download times later if needed. Steam and other platforms would likely update their software to allow for offline authentication in a worst case scenario where they go out of business. Preserving access to your game files shows good faith with customers and motivates them to keep the platform running smoothly as a business. 
### Evolving Digital Platforms 
How we access and play games is constantly changing as technology advances. In the next decade, mobile phones may become powerful enough to serve as our main gaming devices, linking to docking stations for big screen play. Cloud gaming could also take off, where simple frontend clients stream computational heavy gameplay from datacenters. Existing platforms like Steam would adapt to remain relevant in such a future marketplace. New disruptors may also emerge that rethink digital game ownership rights and accessibility without an internet connection. 
### Potential Scenarios 
If Steam were to shut down unexpectedly, like if Valve was acquired or due to unforeseen financial troubles, they would likely make ensuring customer access and experience a top priority in order to maintain goodwill. One option could be releasing standalone game launchers or selling the platform to another company interested in continuing operations. As a last resort, they may open source authentication systems to enable independent third party support. The thriving gaming community would also rally to preserve access to treasured games through alternative means if needed.
### Blizzard's Example 
Blizzard Entertainment demonstrated how platforms can adjust their digital rights management over time with Diablo 2. The game originally required the CD to play but later received a patch eliminating this limitation. Anyone who had registered a copy also gained the ability to freely redownload the game, solving issues caused by aging physical media. This showed flexibility in catering to the way people play changing as technology progressed. Platforms like Steam would aim to follow precedents maintaining fair and reasonable player access.
### Future-Proofing Digital Libraries  
As gaming shifts more towards digital platforms and away from physical copies, it becomes important for both developers and consumers to think about ways to help "future-proof" access to the games libraries being built up. Having options to play games offline in some manner provides reassurance that all the time and money invested won't be completely lost if unforeseen disruptions occur down the line to the services used to manage those libraries. Balancing digital rights with accessibility will shape how comfortable people feel relying primarily on online infrastructure for their games. 
In summary, while fully offline gameplay requires authentication that Steam and other platforms provide, options exist to back up and potentially restore games locally in certain situations. Evolving technologies will also change how we access games, with platforms motivated to maintain relevance by adapting services. Precedents like Blizzard's policy amendments demonstrate flexibility that could benefit players in unpredicted scenarios that may impact established services long-term. Having alternatives and thinking ahead helps minimize potential risks from over-reliance on single digital platforms.
