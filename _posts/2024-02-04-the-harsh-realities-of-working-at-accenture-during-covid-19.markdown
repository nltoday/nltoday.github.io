Accenture, a large global technology consulting firm, has been laying off employees and pressuring others to resign during the pandemic due to a lack of projects. Former employees share their difficult experiences on the company's bench and the unjust treatment they faced.
### Uncertain Job Security 
The first targets for layoffs at Accenture were those who had been allocated to the company's "bench". The bench refers to employees who are in between project assignments and awaiting their next role. However, the bench conditions have severely deteriorated, with headcounts being drastically reduced. One ex-employee mentioned that the bench size was cut from over 300 people down to just 80. 
Without any warning, people would get a call from their manager and HR informing them there were no suitable positions and their services were no longer required. Employees were given an ultimatum - resign by a certain deadline or face [termination without a experience letter](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-holiday-dog-lover-funny-scottish-terrier-christmas-tree-2). Getting terminated would make it incredibly difficult to find a new job, especially during an economic downturn. Those who complained about the unfair treatment were told to keep conversations "confidential".

### Empty Promises of Empathy and Inclusion
It is ironic that Accenture takes pride in its carefully crafted image of promoting values like diversity, inclusion and speaking up for injustice, yet did little to support employees who had faithfully delivered projects for years. If projects in certain technologies wound down, employees in those domains found themselves suddenly out of a job with no fault of their own. Accenture showed a lack of **empathy for employees** at a time they needed support the most. 
While the company may train people in niche technologies, it is willing to discard them at the first sign of a market slowdown. Employees feel used to deliver work but then cast aside like disposable resources once experience is gained. This goes against Accenture's publicized mission to be an employer of choice where people can build long-term careers.
### Total Lack of Transparency 
Staff on the bench received no heads up about performance issues or the risks to their jobs. One individual mentioned being terminated directly without any prior communication from their bench manager. Accenture expects employees to commit extended hours including late nights to meet project deadlines but repays dedication with a lack of transparency. People felt blindsided by suddenly losing their only source of income through no fault of their own. 
By pressuring resignations over terminations, Accenture avoids unemployment insurance costs and negative attrition metrics. But this leaves ex-employees in an extremely vulnerable position to search for new roles without references during an economic downturn. The manner of enforced resignations shows Accenture values metrics over genuine care for people whose careers are impacted.
### Random Targeting Through Unfair Processes
Stories emerged of employees being arbitrarily placed on Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs) and coerced to resign. PIPs are supposed to help underperformers improve but serve as a means to ease people out when budget cuts are needed. With projects slowing down across domains, there seemed to be no objective criteria for deciding who stays or goes. Employees felt targeted due to factors beyond their control like technology specializations or to meet internal quotas. 
This created an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty for those who remained. No one could feel secure about their jobs despite clear performance track records. The lack of transparency around PIP decisions severely damages employee trust and well-being. It shows Accenture prioritized short-term cost cutting over fair treatment of hardworking individuals.
### High Pressure Working Conditions With No Loyalty
To deliver projects on tight deadlines, people routinely worked long hours including weekends and late nights. Accenture expects this level of dedication from staff but repays it with a lack of job security or loyalty during difficult times. Employees felt used as **disposable resources** to be discarded at the first signs of a economic slowdown. 
If projects in certain technologies wound down, people specializing in those areas found themselves out of a job through no fault of their own. At a minimum, Accenture should have reasonable redeployment or outplacement support commitments for staff in such situations. Terminating/forcing out people during a crisis further burdens India's job market and economy at large. It showed a lack of empathy and care for the wellbeing of those who helped deliver value for many years.
### Life After Accenture - An Uncertain Struggle 
Getting suddenly terminated or forced out left many ex-employees with no income support and struggling to find new opportunities during a jobs crisis. One individual mentioned the challenges of searching without references or an experience letter. The lack of transparency damaged employee careers and long term prospects. 
Even experienced hires may find it hard to explain abrupt job changes to new prospective employers. It adds undue stress on people already bearing the impact of a loss of livelihood. Some who voiced concerns about unfair treatment online were threatened with legal action by Accenture, further traumatizing individuals. 
Those left behind also live under constant fear of further layoffs or PIPs. Overall employee morale and trust in the organization is severely damaged. The callous cost-cutting measures have tarnished Accenture's employer brand at a time when companies should stand by their people.
### Taking a Stand Through Open Discussions 
It is crucial that ex-employees freely share their experiences to raise awareness of the realities people may face at Accenture. Only open discussions can counter misleading communications from companies about diversity and care for employees. While legal recourse may not be feasible, anonymous employee reviews on job sites and social media can help prospective hires make informed decisions. 
Together, employees past and present must push for transparency on redundancy policies, realistic job previews, fair PIP processes and proper outplacement support during economic downturns. Companies need accountability more than ever to protect the livelihoods of people whose dedication help power their success. With unity and courage to speak truth to power, justice may be found for those unfairly impacted.
