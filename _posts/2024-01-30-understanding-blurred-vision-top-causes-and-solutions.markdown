Blurry or foggy vision can impact daily life and be caused by minor or serious health issues. This article explores the most common reasons for blurred vision and options for resolution. 
### Eye Strain and Digital Device Overuse
Prolonged near work like reading, using computers, phones and tablets can lead to [eye fatigue and blurry vision](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/ackman). The small eye muscles must work harder to focus on nearby objects. Taking periodic breaks to look into the distance can help rested tired eyes. Blinking frequently also promotes moisture for comfortable vision. 
Spending extended time staring at screens shifts focus between your device and distant backgrounds more than traditional reading. This constant back-and-forth motion strains the eyes. To counteract digital eye strain, follow the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Using blue light blocking glasses while on devices at night may further reduce eyestrain.

### Refractive Errors and Presbyopia
Common refractive errors causing blurry vision include **nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism**. Nearsightedness makes distant objects blurry while farsightedness impacts close vision clarity. Astigmatism results in distorted rather than clear sight at all distances. Regular eye exams can detect refractive errors treatable with prescription eyeglasses or contact lenses.
Presbyopia is natural age-related hardening of the eye's lens that occurs starting in a person's late 30s or 40s. At this stage, the lens loses flexibility for focusing on close objects. Reading glasses, bifocals or progressive lenses can be fitted to treat symptoms of **age-related blurry near vision**. Maintaining an up-to-date eyeglass prescription ensures clear sight.
### Cataracts and Other Ocular Conditions
As the eye's normally clear lens becomes cloudy, cataracts are a common cause of blurry or hazy vision among older adults. Cataract surgery is usually very effective for restoring clear sight once the cataract has matured enough. Preventing risk factors like smoking, excessive sunlight exposure and obesity may slow cataract progression. 
Other potential causes of blurred vision include corneal ulcers or abrasions impacting the surface layer of the eye, uveitis or iritis inducing inflammation within the eye, glaucoma raising inner pressure, and retinal problems like detachments or **age-related macular degeneration**. Consultation with an ophthalmologist can determine the right treatment approach depending on the specific condition identified.
### Diabetes and Associated Retinal Issues
Uncontrolled diabetes puts one at higher risk for diabetic retinopathy, a disease impairing blood flow to the retina. Mild non-proliferative retinopathy may only cause minimal vision changes while more severe proliferative retinopathy can result in extensive blurriness, dark or missing areas of vision. Retinal detachment is also a diabetes-related vision threat. 
Yearly dilated eye exams checking for early signs of retinopathy allow for timely intervention slowing progression to more advanced stages. Laser treatments, injections and occasionally surgery may be used to manage proliferative changes and stabilize vision in diabetics. Keeping blood sugar well-managed with medication, diet and exercise helps curb diabetic eye disease risks.
### Migraines and Head Injuries
Ocular or **retinal migraines** can materialize as flashing lights, zig-zag lines or shadows moving across the visual field along with headaches on one side of the head. These neurological events typically last less than an hour and go away without treatment. Identifying and avoiding migraine triggers helps limit attacks.
Traumatic brain or eye injuries may cause temporary blurred vision through contusions or swelling. Seek immediate medical attention for head traumas accompanied by confusion, dilated pupils or deteriorating vision. Most post-injury blurriness eases over a variable recovery period with rest. Seeing flashes of light after a migrane or injury warrants prompt ophthalmologist evaluation.
### Transient Ischemic Attacks and Strokes  
Ministokes called transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) temporarily disrupt blood flow to the brain. Vision problems including dimmed sight or field cuts could last minutes in a TIA but resolve completely without lasting effects. However, TIAs raise stroke risk and require prompt follow-up care for underlying conditions.
A stroke blocking an artery severely limits blood and oxygen supply damaging brain cells and vision pathways. In addition to blurred vision, stroke signs incorporate weakness or numbness on one side of the body, face drooping and speech difficulties. Calling 911 immediately can facilitate emergency treatment possibly reversing stroke damage. Early action means a better chance of limiting disability through rehabilitation.
### Other Potential Triggers
Other occasional triggers for temporary blurred vision include eye floaters, dry eyes, allergy-induced pink eye or conjunctivitis, pulling an eyelid muscle, eyelid swelling, and use of expired contact lenses or improper contact lens care. Usually these issues fade independently or resolve promptly with over-the-counter treatments. Persistent blurriness despite home remedies warrants an exam by an ophthalmologist or optometrist.
Ruling out minor self-treatable causes allows an eye care specialist to thoroughly check for any serious conditions needing further attention or management. Clear communication of symptoms assists accurate diagnosis and customized intervention plans optimizing vision health long-term. While some blurriness arising from normal aging is inevitable, identifying and addressing correctable causes preserves quality of sight.
With understanding of common blurred vision triggers and proven solutions, individuals gain empowerment over eye wellness. Adopting healthy lifestyle habits and adhering to periodic professional exams helps maintain sharp, comfortable vision long into the future. Sight is precious so advocating for oneself represents an important investment.
