Fleetwood's **unreliable engine** left them stranded for days, and Bakugou's **fiery temper** often saw them in loud arguments. Despite the drama, a passionate love was kindled between man and machine.

### An Airborne Alliance
At U.A., Mirio's reputation as a playboy was well-earned. But after being caught cheating by Deku, Mirio knew he had to change.

Pursuing Wall relentlessly, Mirio wore the structure down with compliments and charm until Wall's defenses crumbled. Their first date was magical - entwined in each others' **blocks and beams**, feelings long-buried in brick and mortar were reignited.
