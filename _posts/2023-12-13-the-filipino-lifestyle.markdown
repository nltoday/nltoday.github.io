### Eating and Bonding
Filipinos love spending time with their families and friends through various bonding activities, such as eating and drinking together. It's common to see Filipinos eating [outdoor meals](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-forever-poodle-1) or enjoying midnight snacks while watching movies at home. Weekends are very social, with Fridays and Saturdays spent bonding over food and drinks. Many also enjoy beach days or rest on Sundays. 
While bonding over food is an important part of Filipino culture, this lifestyle can **lead to unhealthy eating habits**. Filipinos enjoy eating large quantities of food, sometimes forgetting that fatty pork dishes and beer are not good for long-term health. **Not all engage in regular exercise** to balance their diets. When they do work out, common activities include Zumba dance classes or gym routines.

### Late Nights Online  
In the digital age, many Filipinos stay up late at night surfing social media. They love to **share details of their personal lives online** through posts and stories on platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Filipinos are also highly active texters, constantly communicating with their network of friends and family. Some also enjoy **late-night video game sessions** to unwind before bed.
### Expressive Fashion Sense
Filipinos have diverse fashion styles. Some mix high and low fashions, like pairing dressy shirts with casual rubber slippers. Weather is also not always a factor in outfit choices, like wearing thick jackets on hot, sunny days. Regional and class differences also impact dress. Lower income groups favor **oversized jeans and collared shirts**, while cities see influences from Korean and Western trends. Function often outweighs form, like still choosing rubber footwear in rainy conditions over protective rain boots.
### Healthier Options Emerging  
In recent years, more **vegetarian and vegan dining options** have become available in Filipino eateries and cafes. This responds to a growing health-conscious consumer base. Gyms and **workout classes are also popular** for those wanting to maintain an active lifestyle. Many enjoy spending weekends having picnics in parks or simply window shopping at malls. Eating out remains a favorite social activity as well.
### Casual Looks Preferred
While some Filipinos experiment with high fashion styles, most prefer comfortable, casual looks. Jeans, t-shirts, blouses, shorts and similar basics are staples. Even in semi-formal environments, Filipinos feel uneasy in suits and find humor in things like short-sleeved dress shirts paired with ties. The working class national uniform could be described as **oversized jeans, collar shirts and rubber sandals**. Formally dressed Filipinos may seem uncomfortable, like a dog in unusual clothes. 
### Protecting Skin from the Sun   
On hot days, many Filipinos wear scarves as practical sun protection instead of just for looks. Direct sunlight is avoided due to risks like skin **darkening or premature aging**. High society Manila residents still favor lighter, **Hispanic-inspired appearances over Asian features**. Those with naturally darker complexions strive to appear mixed or tanned. Pale skin remains an ideal, suggesting colonial colorism still subtly influences modern Filipino standards of beauty.
### Active Lifestyles Maintained
While unhealthy eating habits pose health risks, sedentary lifestyles are avoided thanks to always being on the go. Running errands, attending social gatherings and performing daily chores keep Filipinos **physically and socially active**. Even leisure is not completely idle, like enjoying karaoke or video games with friends and family. This partly balances the effects of rich foods and late nights online or watching television. Maintaining work-life-play balance contributes to Filipinos' generally happy and vibrant community spirit.
