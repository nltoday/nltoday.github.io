### Different Greetings for Various Situations
When meeting someone for the first time in Japan, it's polite to introduce yourself and express that you hope to get along well. A common greeting is "Hajimemashite, dozouyoroshiku onegaishimasu" which translates to "Nice to meet you for the first time and please instruct me or give me some advice." Japanese people tend to speak humbly, so this greeting conveys modesty and a wish to learn from the other person. 
Among close friends, especially youth, a more casual greeting like "Yoroshiku oneshassu" may be used. **non-verbal communication in japanese culture** plays a big role in how people interact, so body language and tone are also important to consider based on the relationship.

### Morning, Daytime and Evening Greetings
To greet someone in the morning, "Ohayou gozaimasu" is a polite and formal option meaning "good morning." A less formal version is "Ohayou." An even more casual morning greeting used by youth is "Ohai." 
During the day, "Konnichiwa" which literally translates to "good afternoon" but can be used as a general greeting at any time. 
In the evening, "Konbanwa" is appropriate to use and means "good evening."  
Answering the phone, the greeting is "Moshimoshi" which indicates you have received the call.
### Common Phrases beyond just "Hello"
To ask how someone is doing, "Genki desu ka?" is a polite way to say "How are you?" in Japanese. Among close friends, a casual version is "Genki?" 
If you haven't seen someone in a while, "Ohisashiburi desu" is a way to say "Long time no see" in a respectful tone. Close friends may say "Ohisashiburi" for a more casual greeting.
To ask what's new or catch up, "Tyousi wa dou?" translates to "What's up?" in a polite, respectful way. Body language like smiling and making eye contact also shows friendly intent when asking this open-ended question.
### Regional Variations and Context-Specific Greetings 
Differences exist not only between formal and informal greetings, but also based on region and context in Japan. In [kyoto greetings](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/alkire), unique terms like "Ii o-genki desu ka" are used, literally translating to "Are you in good health?" 
When entering a home, dojo, or place of business, it's respectful to say something like "O-huri kudasai" meaning "Please come in." This sets the polite tone of the interaction. 
For answering the phone in a business context, "Moshi moshi, [company name] des" establishes a professional first impression. Including the company name provides relevant context for the call.
Spiritual or cultural locations may incorporate greetings associated with their beliefs and traditions. For example, at a Buddhist temple one may hear "O-hagiari kudasai" meaning "Please enter/come forth." In this way, greetings can reflect deeper cultural aspects beyond just casual communication.
### Non-Verbal Greetings and Body Language 
While words are an important part of greetings, **nonverbal communication** also plays a big role in Japanese culture. Making eye contact, smiling, and bowing are common non-verbal greetings. The degree of formality shown through a bow depends on social status and familiarity. 
Close acquaintances may greet each other casually with a nod or wave of the hand. In professional settings, a deeper bow bending at the waist is expected initially. Among new colleagues or formal introductions, men shake hands while keeping erect posture, and women place their hands together in a prayer position with a slight bow.
Specific gestures like placing the right hand over the heart while bowing slightly convey humbleness. Keeping the hands at your sides or in front shows confidence in a respectful manner. Facial expressions showing warmth, sincerity and joy create a pleasant impression when meeting others.
