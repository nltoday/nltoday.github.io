## Could It Be Network Settings? 
One of the first things to check is whether there are any restrictions or filters applied to the home WiFi network that could be blocking Roblox. **Parental controls, firewall settings,** or policies specifically blocking certain websites or applications need to be investigated. [Network access rules](https://store.fi.io.vn/cute-axolotl-funny-i-axolotl-questions-salamander-265/men&) put in place may inadvertently restrict Roblox connectivity. 
Ensuring the home router and modem are functioning properly is also important. **Temporary network issues** such as intermittent outages could cause unstable connectivity to Roblox. A simple restart of the networking devices may resolve any momentary problems. 
### Verify Device Network Configuration
The WiFi settings on the device where Roblox is not working must be double checked. Being connected to the correct home network and having the right **SSID and password** entered is critical. Outdated or incorrect network configuration details can disrupt connectivity to applications like Roblox.

## Could It Be A Router Issue?
If restarting the router did not fix the problem, the next step would be to ensure the router firmware is up to date. Old **router firmware** is prone to bugs or incompatibilities that disrupt services. Applying any available updates can potentially address underlying technical issues. 
Resetting the router to factory default settings may also resolve the Roblox connectivity problem. This wipes out any custom configurations that could be interfering. Be sure to redo the basic setup and security settings after the reset. 
For persistent connectivity problems, it may help to contact the Internet Service Provider (ISP). They have tools to diagnose the condition of the broadband connection and home network hardware. The ISP can rule out any issues on their infrastructure.
## Checking The Device Itself
Since Roblox works fine when using a mobile hotspot, the affected device itself requires investigation. Being fully updated on both system software and Roblox app versions rules out compatibility conflicts. 
If the problem is isolated to a single device, doing a factory reset and fresh setup may fix software or settings anomalies. This wipes the device clean without resolving what was specifically causing the Roblox failure previously. 
Another option is to try accessing Roblox on a different device connected to the home WiFi. This will determine if the problem extends network wide or lies within the original problematic device. Narrowing down where the issue originates helps troubleshooting efforts.
## Contacting Roblox Support
Getting in touch with Roblox support is recommended if all local troubleshooting steps have been exhausted without success. As the game operators, they have additional tools, logs, and expertise to pinpoint technical problems. 
Roblox representatives can look for clues in account settings, server connection attempts, and other behind-the-scenes data. Certain account errors, regional outages, or undetected software bugs may be blocking the experience. 
Directly communicating the symptoms allows Roblox support to research, test, and potentially find a resolution tailored to the unique situation. They may also need to escalate to appropriate internal teams if a new or complex problem is discovered. 
Staying in contact and providing any requested information will help expedite a solution. With their specialized insight into the Roblox platform, support can often troubleshoot connectivity issues when other methods fail.
## Checking Application Settings 
Before giving up and reinstalling, checking specific in-game or account preferences is worthwhile. Certain **Roblox display settings, audio options,** or interface configurations could cause glitches. 
Ensure parental controls and friend/join restrictions within Roblox itself are not too limiting. These are separate from any imposed by the home network. Adjusting privacy and communication settings may uncover a conflict.
Checking for software updates on any related applications is also prudent. Other programs like voice chat apps used alongside Roblox could potentially introduce connectivity interference. Keeping supplementary services current removes possible variables.
Ensuring logins and passwords are correct never hurts, either. Typos or forgotten credentials would naturally trigger failure to access Roblox from any location until resolved. Preventable login issues are simple to dismiss as the root cause.
## Final Steps If Unsuccessful 
If all troubleshooting steps including checking device settings, the network setup, contacting support yield no solution, some more rigorous options remain. A full reformat and setup of the problematic device may fix deeply embedded issues. 
This should only be an absolute last resort after trying all milder solutions. As a highly disruptive process, device resets are best avoided if less intensive methods show promise. Careful documentation throughout testing also helps support find what was and was not resolved.
Patience and process of elimination are key to overcome connectivity mysteries. With assistance from support workers also investigating their end, the root cause can often be uncovered through collaboration and testing different scenarios methodically. Keeping calm allows for logical troubleshooting.
With teamwork between the user and Roblox experts, connectivity obstacles like this are frequently surmountable given enough diligent effort. The solutions gained also help others facing similar puzzles in the future.
