Computing modulo, also known as the remainder operation, is a common calculation in various areas like mathematics, coding and cryptography. While dedicated modulo buttons are absent on the CASIO FX-82MS graphing calculator, there are straightforward methods to perform modulo using its display modes.
**Computing Remainders with the ab/c Display Mode** 
The FX-82MS calculator has different display modes that can be used to view the quotient and remainder of a division operation. The standard "d/c" display mode only shows the quotient. By switching to the "ab/c" display mode, both the quotient and remainder are visible. 
### Using the "ab/c" Mode for Positive Numbers
To compute modulo on this calculator, first go to the settings menu and select the "ab/c" display mode. Now perform long division as usual, but the result will be shown with the quotient followed by the remainder over the divisor. 
For example, calculating 50 mod 3 yields "16 2/3". The quotient is 16 and the remainder is 2, so the mod is 2. Another example is 54 mod 7 showing "7 5/7", with a modulus of 5. If no remainder is displayed, the modulo is 0.

### Handling Negative Numbers and Large Inputs 
While straightforward for positive numbers, **the "ab/c" mode displays remainders negatively,** which can be confusing for modulo. To address this, simply add the divisor to negative inputs before division. 
For example, -121 mod 26 normally yields "-4 17/26". But adding 26 gives "-121 + 26 / 26 = -95 7/26", with the correct modulus of 9.
**Large inputs exceeding the calculator's precision require alternative techniques**, such as applying modular arithmetic rules to break the problem into smaller steps that fit the calculator's range.

As an alternative to the "ab/c" display mode, remainders can also be determined through **repeated subtraction or division with truncation of remainders**. 
### Finding Remainders via Repeated Subtraction
To find 729 mod 55 through repeated subtraction:
1) Subtract 55 from 729 until the difference is less than 55
2) The last remainder is the modulus
Repeating this process yields a final remainder of 14, so 729 mod 55 = 14.
### Using Division with Truncation 
Division followed by discarding decimals also works. To compute 729/55:
1) 729 / 55 = 13 with remainder 14 
2) Truncate after the quotient to discard remainders
3) The last remainder is the modulus
Therefore, 729 mod 55 = 14 using either repeated subtraction or division with truncation.
**In Summary,** while the FX-82MS lacks a dedicated modulo key, clear and effective methods exist using its quotient/remainder display modes or basic arithmetic operations. With practice, any modulus problem can be solved directly on this versatile graphing calculator.
