## The Small Gestures
### Showing Thoughtfulness
When it's 3am and you get his call, saying that the bus he was travelling in had stopped for a few minutes, and he'd just had dinner, and now was back in his seat. You can hear him munching something at the other end, and you enquire what it is. He says it's a packet of dry fruits he'd picked up at a street side stall. You love [dry fruits snacks](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cow-farmer-i-love-farm-things-i-do-in-my-spare-time-funny-v-neck-t-shirt/women&) a lot, and you ask him to bring some for you. He reluctantly declines, as it's cold and he doesn't want to leave the snug comfort of his seat and get down to brace the biting chill outside. You're a tad disappointed, but you let him be, as you know he's just like a small kid who loves all the comforts, and needs to be pampered. He doesn't have to get down in the middle of the night just to attend to a small whim of yours.

### Following Through on the Gesture  
The very first thing he does when he meets you the following day is place a small packet in your hands. A small packet of dry fruits. A little bit of packeted love, unexpressed affection and boundless joy. You hug him tight. All he does is smell your hair and tell you that you need to stop munching on these delicacies if you want to lose any weight. Your smile only widens. Small gestures like this show how much he cares.
## Family Love
### celebrating Each Other's Successes
Your sister celebrates your achievements more than hers. Family is there to lift each other up, especially when it comes to accomplishments. 
### An Unwavering Source of Support  
Your father is the only man in the world who never gets jealous of your prosperity and instead wants you to prosper. He wants the best for you and will encourage you no matter what.
### Ready to Have Your Back
Your brother may not have ever indulged in an argument, but does not shy away from fighting off the guys who tease you in school. Family protects each other through both words and actions.
## Thoughtful Attention to Detail 
### Remembering the Little Things
Your mother has now forgotten her taste and her favorite dish, but she very well remembers yours. When someone takes the time to learn what truly matters to you, it shows you're important to them.
### Personalized Through Numbers
When I was about 10 years old, my father bought a number locking briefcase. I wanted to crack the number. It was easy, it was a combination of the numbers only, and I had plenty of time, so I started guessing from 000 to 999 (yeah!). Finally the briefcase opened at 081. I was like Yahoo!! ... and then moved on. Later I found that he used this number - 81 at a lot of places. I never bothered. I was plain naive. My father is a reserved man. He would never come and hug/kiss me, push me away with a smile when I kiss him, but would have that caring look for me in his eyes. I am born 1981. 81. :-) The smallest of connections can have deep meaning.
## Unconditional Acceptance
### Overlooking Imperfections 
They come to you even when you are rude to them. True love looks past faults and frustrations to see the person within. 
### Prioritizing Emotional Needs
When your happiness becomes someone else's happiness, it means that someone loves you. Those who care put your feelings and well-being above all else.
## The Power of a Simple Gesture
A small packet of dry fruits. A little bit of packeted love, unexpressed affection and boundless joy. If that isn't love, then I don't know what is. The tiniest acts can speak volumes when it comes to how we feel about others. Those who pay attention to the small things reveal how deeply they care.
