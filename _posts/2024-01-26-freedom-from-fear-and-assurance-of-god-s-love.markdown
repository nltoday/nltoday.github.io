### Finding Truth and Freedom 
God tells us that perfect love casts out fear. For years I struggled believing that God's love was for me, knowing my sinfulness. But God kept showing me His love through experiences that freed me from depression and helped me connect with others. One day I realized it was wrong to doubt His words. When I confessed and asked forgiveness, He comforted me and continues confirming that I belong to Him.
