## Life begins in luxurious comfort
Babies spend the first nine months of their development cocooned snugly in the womb. During this time, they are effortlessly fed through the placenta by their mother's nutrient-rich blood. They have an unlimited supply of everything they need without exerting any effort of their own. Carbon dioxide is efficiently cleared from their bloodstream and oxygen delivered, all without the need for breathing. [Life in the intrauterine environment](https://store.fi.io.vn/cottagecore-aesthetic-axolotl-mushroom-hat-shroomxolotl-129/men&) is as luxurious and pampered an existence as one could imagine. 
## Saying goodbye to security and sensing the change
However, this idyllic state cannot last forever. As a baby's due date approaches, hormones trigger the beginning of labor. Contractions start to painfully squeeze and compress the infant through the narrow birth canal. Their developing lungs must expel the amniotic fluid inside through forceful expulsions. By the time they emerge, their precious skull has been squeezed into an elongated shape adapting to the tight squeeze. Finally out, the **birth process** has been an exhausting ordeal for the newborn.
### A shocking change of scenery 
They find themselves suddenly ejected from the comfort of the womb into a jarring new environment. It is cold, noisy and intensely bright compared to the warm, dark haven they knew before. People they don't recognize are looming over them, probing and prodding. Many babies instinctively scrunch their eyes shut against the painful glare of unfamiliar lights. Orifices are invaded by unfamiliar medical tools in a disorienting assault of new sensations.

### Overwhelmed by the overload of stimuli
All of their basic needs were effortlessly met in the womb but now they must cope with this shocking sensory overload alone. It is completely natural that babies cry out in protest at the trauma of birth and adjusting to extrauterine life. Their wails communicate how overwhelmed and irritated they feel by this drastic change. In this state, they cannot smile since they are too upset and distressed. Doctors wisely recognize that it takes time to adjust.
## Triggering the first breath and cry 
Immediately after being severed from the umbilical cord and placenta, an infant's carbon dioxide levels start rising rapidly in their bloodstream. This acts as a signal to the areas of the brain responsible for respiration that it is now time to breathe independently. The brain dutifully responds, triggering impulses to contract the diaphragm and expand the rib cage to draw in that very first breath of air. It also elicits the power crying reflex to forcefully expel any residual fluid from the lungs. 
### Coordinating the mighty first breath
When a newborn's cry occurs, it happens in two distinct phases. First comes a deep inhalation to fill the lungs with as much air as possible in preparation. Then comes the prolonged exhalation phase where all that air is forcefully expelled in the form of their signature loud wailing. This coordinated breath essentially 'clears their pipes' and oxygenates their bloodstream for the first crucial time unaided. It is an impressive respiratory feat for such a young life.
### Coping with the aftermath of birth 
In the following days and weeks, tiny infants must adjust physically to being out of the womb as well as processing all the new sensory inputs bombarding them. No wonder they spend so much time crying or in an agitated sleep! Gradually though, as they gain confidence in independent breathing and feeling secure with caring adults, their cries soften into coos of contentment. Their first smiles start to emerge as the trauma of birth fades into a happy babyhood.
## From alien world to home sweet home  
The transition every human experiences, from the safety and intimacy of the womb to the startling conditions of extrauterine life, is nothing short of remarkable. Though born expecting luxurious comfort without effort, infants display incredible resilience as they learn to breathe, feed and cope alone. Their distress calls at birth serve an important purpose in communicating their experience as helpless new members of a brand new world. With time and TLC, it becomes ‘home sweet home’.
