## A Makeup Expert's Tips
As a professional makeup artist with over 23 years of experience working with brands like Dior, I've had my fair share of lipstick stains on my clothes. Luckily, my uniform was always black so it helped hide stains. But I've tried every spot remover on the market with limited success until my uncle shared his secret—dish soap! Here are the steps I recommend.
### The Power of Dish Detergent  
Dish detergent is surprisingly effective at breaking down the oils in lipstick stains. Simply apply dish soap directly to the stain and use a clean toothbrush to gently scrub it in under very hot water. This helps loosen the stain. Rinse and repeat until the spot starts to fade. Then soak it one more time before washing as usual. [lipstick stain removal clothing](https://yt.io.vn/collection/acheson)

### Timeliness is Key
It's best to treat lipstick stains as soon as possible before washing to avoid them setting further. Once washed with the stain still present, it becomes much harder to remove completely. The material also impacts how easy it is—some fabrics are more stain-resistant than others. But dish soap is a great first step for any fabric. 
### Photoshop Tricks for Digital Lipstick Removal  
In the digital world, there are also effective techniques for erasing lipstick from photos using Photoshop.
### Precision Path Selection  
Create a path around the lip area with the Pen Tool for a clean selection. Increase the feather radius slightly for a smooth edge. Avoid using the Magic Wand as it may not select perfectly. **digital lipstick removal photoshop longtail**
### Hue Adjustment Layer Magic
Add a Hue/Saturation adjustment layer and move the saturation slider left to drain color from the selection. Play with the setting until the lips look natural again. This allows subtle color correction versus editing with hard brushes.
### Stain Soaking Solutions
For especially stubborn stains, there are some powerful presoak solutions to try before laundering.
### Absorb the Color 
Submerge the stain face down on a paper towel to wick away pigment. Then dab a stain remover directly on top and layer more towels to force it into the stain. Replace towels as they absorb color to prevent re-setting.
### Give it Time to Lift
Allow the solution to fully work before rinsing. Most stains need 5-10 minutes of soaking time for best results. With patience and the right method, even set-in lipstick marks can disappear from clothes.
### Bright Smiles and Bright Clothes  
Whether in real life or online, these techniques help keep both smiles and clothes looking their best for longer with lipstick stains just a memory. With a little soap or code, you can remove lipstick while keeping clothes color-fast.
