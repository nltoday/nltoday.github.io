### Downloading on Steam
Steam is one of the most popular digital distribution platforms for PC gaming. It allows users to manage game downloads through its [download manager](https://store.fi.io.vn/white-pomeranian-dog-weightlifting-in-cyber-fitness-gym-2). This feature lets you pause downloads, resume from where you left off, and prioritize certain downloads over others. This makes it very convenient to pause large game downloads and resume them later without having to restart from the beginning.

### Participating in Steam Betas
One solution that worked well for downloading the 87.4GB Destiny 2 game on Steam was participating in the Steam beta program. After opting into Steam betas, all further downloads on my account never reset to 0% progress even after closing Steam or restarting my PC. The beta features likely improved Steam's handling of partial downloads. This allowed me to easily pause and resume the massive Destiny 2 install over multiple sessions.
### Other Options When Downloads Reset
There may be times when Steam or other platform downloads still reset despite having features to resume. In such cases, some additional options can help. You can try downloading the game files directly from the developer's website if available. Some games also support downloading content in smaller chunks or stages that are less likely to reset on pause. Network optimization like limiting other devices/traffic may also help stable partial downloads.
### Browser Games vs Downloaded Games 
Browser-based games rely more on cloud computing than large downloads. Their games codes primarily run remotely on server hardware. As a result, typical browser games require little to no major installations on your local machine. They may ask you to install small browser plug-ins, but those downloads are quite small compared to downloaded PC/console games. So pausing large browser game installs is usually not an issue. 
### Direct Game Installations
Games you download and install directly from a developer's website rather than a storefront will manage downloads individually too. **Most** direct installers support pausing downloads to be resumed later, though specifics vary per game. When in doubt, it's best to test the game's download behavior. Try pausing a download halfway through to confirm it picks up where you left off when restarting it later. This ensures the game's download system can properly handle large installs over multiple sessions.
### Safely Downloading from Third-Party Sites  
If a game isn't available on official stores, some turn to third-party piracy sites. While these allow accessing games for free, they also carry risks like malware. The website **Steam Unlocked** is considered one of the safer options by some. One tip shared was to be careful of pop-ups when downloading, and immediately close any new tabs that open post-download to avoid potential infections. Overall, official stores tend to be the lowest risk method for large game downloads and play.
### Conclusion
In summary, reputable digital platforms like Steam have robust download management to easily handle resuming large game installs over multiple sessions. Other options include direct installers, smaller staggered downloads, and optimizing network usage. Browser games generally don't require major downloads. When using third-party piracy sites, applying caution around suspicious pop-ups is prudent. Proper planning and understanding each method's capabilities helps perfect the process of downloading colossal PC game files.
