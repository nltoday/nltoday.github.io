### An Introduction to Viber on Multiple Devices
Viber is a popular cross-platform instant messaging application that allows users to make voice and video calls, send messages and share files. One of the advantages of Viber is that it supports the use of a single account across multiple devices. Once you install and log into Viber using your mobile number on one device like your phone, you can then easily install it on other devices like your iPad or laptop and messages will be synced across all linked devices.

### The Issue of Losing My Primary Phone Number
While the multi-device feature of Viber is very convenient, it also poses some challenges if your primary registered device, in my case my mobile phone, gets lost or stolen. After installing Viber on my iPad using the same phone number, my phone was unfortunately stolen. Now when I try to install Viber on my new phone or tablet using that number, it prompts for an activation code which is sent to the original registered phone number. Since I no longer have access to that phone, I am unable to receive the code. This essentially locks me out of my Viber account on any new device.
### Contacting Viber Support for Help
In such a situation, the best approach is to immediately contact the Viber support team for assistance. On logging into the Viber website, you will find options to report a problem or get in touch with an agent. I selected the "lost/stolen device" option and explained my issue clearly - that I have lost access to my primary phone number registered with Viber but need to recover my account on a new device. The support agent understood my problem and guided me through the next steps.
### Verifying Account Ownership Through Other Methods 
Since sending verification codes to the old number was not possible, Viber support asked me to provide additional details to verify that I am the legitimate owner of the account. This included the last 4 digits of the phone number, approximate date of Viber registration, email address if linked, and purchase/payment history if any in-app purchases were made. With this information, they were able to validate that it was indeed my Viber account and not someone else trying to take over the number.
### Resetting the Activation Process 
Once account ownership was confirmed, the support agent informed me that they could reset the activation process to allow installing Viber on a new device without needing the code. However, as a security measure this can only be done after a certain waiting period of around 2-4 weeks since the original device was lost. This helps prevent any misuse if the old phone gets into the wrong hands. After the waiting time was over in my case, I was given a special reset link to complete the installation on any new device of my choice.
### Successfully Recovering My Viber Account
When I clicked on the reset link provided by Viber support in the email, it bypass the code entry screen and directly started downloading and installing Viber. After signing in, I was able to seamlessly access all my previous chat history, contacts and settings. All messages sent during the interim period when I was locked out also got delivered once the new device registration was complete. I am now able to use Viber as usual through my new phone number. The support team was very helpful in patiently resolving my issue.
### A Few Tips to Secure Your Account 
While technology makes things convenient, it also needs securing against possible vulnerabilities. A [device loss prevention strategy](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/abdallah) and some basic safety steps could help avoid such account recovery hassles in future:
- Set a strong PIN/password on the Viber app as well as your device for additional protection in case of theft 
- Enable remote wiping/location tracking features if the device manufacturer provides such an option
- Link a trusted email address and keep it updated for security verification purposes
- Avoid saving extremely sensitive conversations that could harm if accessed by others
- Backup chat history periodically to external storage in case original device is damaged or stolen beyond recovery
By following some basic precautions and being prepared with account recovery mechanisms, you can securely use Viber and other apps seamlessly across devices. But prompt action is critical if any registered device goes missing to avoid potential misuse of personal data or credentials during the recovery period.
### Wrapping Up
In summary, losing access to your primary registered Viber number due to device theft poses a challenge but is not impossible to overcome. By contacting Viber support proactively with proof of ownership, your account security can be restored through methods bypassing code verification. A short reset wait along with safety practices make the process safer and help you continue conversations on new devices after such incidents. I hope sharing my experience helps others in similar situations to smoothly recover their Viber accounts as well. Do let me know if you have any other questions!
