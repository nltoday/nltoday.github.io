### Documentation Requirements
For any trip - whether domestic or international - children of any age require a ticket and proper documentation. For international travel, children must have a passport or national ID card that meets the requirements of the destination country. Some additional documentation like permission letters or documentation from non-travelling parents may be required depending on the child's situation. **It is essential to carefully check documentation rules for each country well in advance of travel.**

### Infant Travel Rules  
Infants under 2 can travel on a parent's lap for free with an "infant ticket." No seat or baggage allowance is provided. A stroller is allowed to be brought on board and checked at the gate. For safety, **infants must remain securely buckled in strollers or slings during boarding and flight.**
### Child Ticket Requirements
All children 2 years and older must have their own ticket and seat. If a child turns 2 during travel, an appropriate ticket must be purchased for any flights on or after their birthday. With a child ticket, standard baggage allowances apply. **Airlines have varying policies on transporting child car seats, so it is crucial to confirm regulations with your specific carrier.** 
### Recommended Child Safety Precautions
For young children who cannot yet sit independently, many parents opt to use their own car seat on the plane for additional security. During a turbulent flight, an unrestrained child risks **serious injury if thrown from a caregiver's lap.** Even for older children, the FAA recommends using seat belts whenever possible. **Proper restraint is the safest choice for kids of any age on an aircraft.**
### Baggage Allowances and Car Seat Policies  
Baggage allowances for child tickets are usually the same as adult tickets. Most US carriers allow installed car seats onboard if FAA-approved, while European airlines tend not to. Car seats can typically be checked at no extra cost. For **convenience when traveling with young families, it pays to understand each airline's policies on baggage, car seats, and strollers well in advance.** 
### Preparing Children for Takeoff and Landing
Flight experiences can be scary or uncomfortable for little ones unaccustomed to air travel. Experts recommend [gentle preparation](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/chihuahua-dog) with age-appropriate books or videos depicting what to expect. Provide reassurance, distractions like toys or snacks, and if possible try to schedule flights during nap times. **With patience and preparation, you can help make flying more pleasant for children.**
### Travel Safety is Paramount with Children  
As the main story illustrated, situations can change rapidly at altitude. For their protection, it is non-negotiable that all children be securely fastened in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved child restraints appropriate for their weight, height and age. In storms or turbulence, even a short lapse in restraint poses tremendous risk of **grave injuries from impact with hard surfaces inside the cabin.** When traveling with kids, their safety must come before all other considerations. **Proper restraint is not up for debate - it is a necessity.**
