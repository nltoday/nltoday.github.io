### My Resignation from IRS
I resigned from my job at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in [October 2016](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/alexandre). According to the government rules in India, employees who retire through normal superannuation are entitled to receive all retirement benefits on their last working day. However, for those who opt for Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS), the process of receiving retirement benefits begins after the retirement date, though all the paperwork is completed prior to that.

### The Promise and Delay
After I opted for VRS, the Administrative Officer (AO) of my office promised that I would receive my retirement benefits within a week since all the documentation work was already finished. However, despite the AO following up with the Pay and Accounts Officer (PAO) every week, she was not processing the benefits and kept giving excuses. I patiently waited for almost a month but there was no progress.
### The Financial Loss
The delayed disbursal of retirement benefits meant **a huge financial loss for me every single day** as I was not receiving the interest on the accumulated amount. After a month of constant run-arounds, I finally lost my cool with the situation.
### Escalating the Issue 
I directly contacted the Principal Chief Controller of Accounts (PCCA) in Delhi, who was the head of Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) for the entire country. I apprised her about the PAO's misconduct causing the delay. She spoke to the PAO but was given some flimsy excuses. 
### Providing Evidence
The PCCA then explained the actual reasons for the delay to me. By this time, I had gathered all relevant documentary evidence supporting my case through right to information requests, which I shared with the PCCA over WhatsApp.
### Action Taken
Armed with hard evidence, the PCCA pulled up the PAO again and instructed her to process the benefits immediately. I received my full retirement package within the next 48 hours, ending the unwanted delay and loss.
### The Power of Assertiveness 
This experience taught me the importance of being assertive when your legitimate rights are being violated. Had I not escalated the matter to the highest authorities and provided proof, the delay would have continued indefinitely. While remaining calm is ideal, we must be willing to lose temper and fight for justice when the situation demands it.
### My Lessons Learned
Through this episode, I learned that **patience has its limits** and authorities will not act without proper motivation. We cannot expect others to fight for our rights and must be willing to assert ourselves. Also, maintaining a record of evidence and communications comes in handy to make an irrefutable case. Overall, this incident highlighted how a mix of patience, righteous anger and corrective action at the right level can help resolve issues effectively.
### Staying Positive
Despite facing multiple challenges, it is essential we maintain optimism and focus on positive solutions. As the Buddha said "Let it be, and the mud will settle." With time and reflection, distressing emotions subside on their own. Practicing meditation, spending time in nature, creative pursuits, altruistic activities and surrounding oneself with good company also help foster inner peace. By cultivating mindfulness and equanimity, we can remain calm under pressure.
