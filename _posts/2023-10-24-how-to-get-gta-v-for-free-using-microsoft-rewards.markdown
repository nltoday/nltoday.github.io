## Earning Points Through Daily Activities 
Microsoft offers a rewards program that allows users to earn points each day by performing simple tasks using Bing and Microsoft services. Some of the daily activities include:
[Bing search queries rewards points](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-best-dog-mom-ever-retro-usa-american-flag-123-chihuahua-dog) - Every search query made through Bing's search engine on any device earns 10 points. This adds up fast considering most people do multiple searches every day. 
**Daily poll and quizzes** - The Microsoft rewards homepage features a short poll or fun quiz daily. Completing these earns between 30-70 points depending on the activity. It takes less than 2 minutes. 
**Cortana search reminders** - Setting up Cortana or other reminder tools to pop up a notification each day ensures users don't forget to check rewards and miss out on free points. 
### Accumulating Points Through Regular Usage
In addition to the daily activities, Microsoft rewards points through regular digital usage across their services and partnerships. This includes: 
Earning points for clicks on rewards program promoted offers and software. Search queries made directly on Bing powered search bars and clicking sponsored links all contribute extra points over time.
Microsoft rewards special offers and bonuses regularly that can double points earned from mobile searches or quizzes for a limited time. This accelerates the points accumulation.

### Redeeming Points For Digital Content and Services
Once a sufficient amount of points have been collected in the Microsoft rewards account, they can be redeemed for several popular digital services and gifts:
**Xbox Live Gold subscription** - Costing around 30,000 points yearly, this provides access to online multiplayer gaming and free games each month. 
**Xbox Game Pass membership** - Another 30,000 points gets a year of Game Pass, with access to an extensive library of games for Xbox and PC. 
**Digital gift cards** - Points can purchase digital gift cards from retailers like Amazon or Microsoft store credit. Gift cards allow purchasing games during sales like Grand Theft Auto V for as low as $10.
## Getting Grand Theft Auto V through Rewards Points 
Now that the methods for earning Microsoft rewards points have been outlined, we'll look at a specific scenario to obtain Grand Theft Auto V for free. 
### Tracking Daily Progress 
By making Bing searches, taking the daily poll plus quizzes, an average user could expect to gain 300-500 points each day. Over the course of a year with minimal effort, that results in potential points of 109,500 to 196,500.
### Purchasing Annual Subscriptions
With 30,000 points, a 12 month Xbox Live Gold subscription provides online multiplayer access. Another 30,000 points gets a year of Xbox Game Pass membership with its library of titles. 
### Waiting for Discounted Offers 
Regularly Grand Theft Auto V goes on sale through Microsoft Store or partner digital retailers for $10-15 during promotions. By saving up points, gift cards can cover sale prices to get the game without spending money. 
### Continuing the Habit Long Term
With Xbox hardware and software integrated, Microsoft rewards becomes a perpetually renewable benefit for committed users. Each year points can fund new games, subscription renewals and build a collection over time worth hundreds of dollars for just minutes a day.
