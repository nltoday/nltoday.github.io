Staying at a coliving space is supposed to provide convenience and community, but my time at Colive was anything but convenient and community-focused. Here is my experience in detail across multiple parts.
## The Broken Promises  
The aesthetically pleasing website promised amenities like high-speed wifi, washing machines, and friendly community managers. **However, none of this proved true in reality.** I was very excited when I booked my room online and paid the security deposit. But during check-in, there was no manager present and I had to get the keys from an unhelpful housekeeping staff. The courteous agent who helped with booking disappeared and was replaced by rude managers who avoided resolving issues. 
## Dealing with Constant Disruptions
One of the biggest frustrations was the frequent and long-lasting water supply disruptions. On multiple occasions, there would be no running water for 2-3 days. **The excuses of motor breakdown grew tiresome.** Temporary fixes did little to actually solve the problem in the long run. We even created a residents WhatsApp group to crowd-source information on water availability. The broken washing machines only compounded daily challenges. Requests for basic amenities felt like pleading.
### Lack of Hygiene and Management 
During one long water outage, the housekeeping staff quit without notice. Piles of uncollected garbage and a dirty property took its toll on health. A **lack of dedicated on-site management** meant negligence was the norm. Property managers were unhelpful and used abusive language instead of fixing issues. Accountability was non-existent and responsibilities were shrugged off constantly.

### Unreasonable Complaint Handling Process
Raising complaints on their buggy app was a chore in itself. Replies often took 2-3 days and offered no resolution assurance. I once reported an **“emergency water outage situation”** only to be rudely shouted at for labeling it as such. The chaotic manager changes disrupted any semblance of follow up or consistency as well. Each manager peddled their own set of excuses.
## Disgusting Pests Invasion
Seeing cockroaches in my room was the last straw. I temporarily shifted to another room as pest control was delayed. But the manager threatened to illegally evict me if I did not hurry back. **Paying hundreds in “damage fees” for their own hygiene lapses was unfair.** Despite multiple attempts, the pest problem persisted throughout my unwelcome stay. 
### Forced to Stay Through Difficult Times
With over a month remaining on the binding initial period, I had no choice but to somehow finish my notice period under miserable conditions. Taking matters into my own hands with brooms and slippers, I tried managing pests alone as paid cleaners shirked responsibilities. My mental and physical health suffered immensely through this unsettling phase. 
## Deposit Penalties Despite Multiple Hardships
Only after sternly confronting management at their head office did I receive my heavily deducted security deposit in the form of a cheque. **Colive failed to honor any of the facilities advertised and caused undue stress through their apathy.** The scars of this coliving nightmare will take a long time to heal from. I urge anyone considering Colive to learn from my negative experience to avoid potential exploitation and abuse of tenants.
