### Discipline or Abuse? 
As a 22-year-old university student, I have very strict rules limiting my freedom and independence. I am required to go home every weekend without exception, even if I have important school commitments or plans with friends. Once home, I am expected to cook, clean, and cannot see or contact any male friends. Even having a part-time job is forbidden, so I secretly work online gigs to have my own money. The most oppressive rule is being forced to wear a hijab at all times—if I do not, I will be physically slapped as punishment. Questioning or disobeying any rule results in the threat of violence, which has left me feeling anxious, depressed, and wanting to give up at times. However, I know losing my sanity is not an option, so I rebel in small ways and accept the consequences of getting "slapped" if it means having some control over my life.

### Prioritizing Perfection Over Wellbeing
As a 15-year-old girl, my entire existence revolves around rules with no room for individuality or making mistakes. I am only allowed very limited and monitored use of technology like my phone. Friendships and relationships are strictly prohibited, and I have no privacy or freedom. Academic success is the top priority—anything less than straight A's is unacceptable and "will NOT be forgiven". Leaving school even a minute late would lead to intense scrutiny. Lying is absolutely forbidden. My mother dictates what I wear and how I present myself. She still physically disciplines me routinely, which where I am from, is considered "training" rather than abuse despite involving things like using hard objects to break on my body. Self-care is not a priority—I am expected to perform demanding chores no matter my physical or mental state. These strict expectations have taken a toll on my wellbeing and development as a young person.
### Fighting for Independence in College 
Now at an Ivy League university at 18, you would think I would have more control over my own life. However, my parents still find ways to exert control, like putting restrictive time limits on my phone usage that don't fit my grown-up responsibilities and circumstances. On top of bills, rent and coursework, I am battling addiction—yet they try to micromanage aspects that should be my own decisions as a legal adult. While it comes from a place of caring and protecting me, controlling behaviors only breed resentment and hinder my progress. I am learning to advocate for myself and **workaround boundary-pushing phone restrictions through technological hacks**, like using other devices when needed instead of relying on them. The journey to full independence is ongoing, but small acts of defiance help reclaiming my autonomy step-by-step.  
### Speaking Out Against the "Norm"
As a Nigerian teenager, my reality of living under excessive discipline masquerading as "training" has been normalized in my community. People dismiss the daily physical and psychological abuse I endure as just preparing me for womanhood. At only 7 or 8 years old, I was made to do chores in the pouring rain and collapsed with fever after, yet told to "suck it up". Now realizing this level of control strips away our dignity and rights, I am speaking out despite risks. My story resonates with many girls suffering in silence. While change will be gradual, platforms like this give us a voice. With support, I believe the next generation can grow up freely in safe loving homes—not under oppressive rules that damage wellbeing in the name of culture or religion. Progress starts with breaking the silence.
### Reclaiming What Was Stolen Through Creativity 
As a young woman subjected to overly strict rules denying my individuality and passion for the arts, I found solace in small rebellious acts of self-expression. Despite bans on activities like dancing, painting or writing fiction, I engaged in them secretly to preserve my sense of identity. Over time, restrictions on hobbies were lifted but the scars of losing my childhood to oppressive control remained. Today, through creative writing and social media within boundaries, I reclaim pieces of myself that were taken away. While complete freedom still feels distant, utilizing loopholes and outlets respects my needs and autonomy and is healing in its own way. My advice is that even under the most oppressive of circumstances, do not let your fire and creativity be extinguished—find legal and safe ways to keep it alive for better days ahead.
### Pursuing Healing Through Open Dialogue  
Looking back, I see how rigid rules stemmed from narrow mindsets versus malicious intent but only bred resentment in me as a young adult. While distant now, open communication is key to improved relationships. Expressing how the constant restrictions and belittling of my thoughts made me feel invalidated, yet understanding their fears and upbringing too, has helped. Affirming each other’s humanity despite differences is a learning process. Growth happens through respectful dialogues, not accusations. With care and effort, the thawing of long-held perspectives becomes possible. While scars remain, choosing forgiveness over grudges lightens the load. Most importantly, prioritizing my wellbeing helps regain a sense of independence without losing family. Overall, healing is a journey—one step at a time, with compassion for all.
