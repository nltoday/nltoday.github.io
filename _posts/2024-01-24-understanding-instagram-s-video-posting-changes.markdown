### Exploring the Shift Towards Reels
Instagram has been aggressively pushing its short-form video feature called Reels in recent months. As a result, any video uploaded to the platform is automatically treated as a Reel unless specified otherwise. **long-form video content creation app**. This has confused many creators who simply want to post standard video posts. Let's take a deeper look at why this change was made and some workarounds.
Instagram sees Reels as their response to TikTok's rising popularity among younger users. By prioritizing short videos in the main feed, they aim to better compete in the short attention span era. However, this has sidelined longer video content that once had a home on Instagram. Creators now need to get creative to share non-Reel videos.

### Ways Videos Are Still Being Posted 
There are a few methods some creators are using to still post standard video posts. One is to keep the video under **15-second video uploads**. Since Reels are capped at 15 seconds, anything shorter avoids being labeled a Reel. **third-party apps like Unfold** also allow uploading videos normally by converting file formats. 
Another workaround is using a computer web browser instead of the mobile app. Some report the browser version still permits regular video posting for now. It's also possible to convert videos into [GIF format uploads](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/dog-father), which Instagram treats as standard image posts due to the smaller file sizes.
While none are as seamless as the old direct video upload, these options provide alternatives for sharing non-short form content amid Instagram's product shift. Whether they remain viable long-term depends on platform policy changes.
### Adapting to Platform Priorities
Whether you agree with Instagram's decision or not, creators must adapt strategically. Posting overly long videos as Reels will frustrate viewers used to the short Reels format. Instead, consider breaking videos into multiple Reels parts or promoting the full version elsewhere like YouTube. 
You can also use Instagram's story feature to tease snippets that drive traffic to other sites hosting longer videos. Effectively utilizing hashtags on Reels to reach interested audiences is also important. The goal is maximizing exposure within Instagram's current constraints.
### Monetization Considerations
Monetizing content requires even more creativity given Instagram's format changes. Options include using affiliate links for **products featured in videos** either in captions or bios. Paid online courses or memberships offering exclusive long-form video content off-platform can also generate revenue. 
Live videos allow super chatting and adding shopping stickers for potential earnings. Consider building an email list to promote longer videos and other paid content outside Instagram. With the right multi-pronged strategy, video creators can still find financial success despite the platform transition. It takes adaptability and embracing different monetization avenues.
### The Future of Video on Instagram
Only time will tell if Instagram further tweaks how video is handled or if competing platforms influence a reversal. For now, staying attuned to testing new policies is wise. Creators must thoughtfully determine the best approach for each video depending on length, audience and goals. Applying various workarounds like trimming, using third-party apps or moving videos elsewhere keeps options open amid change. A flexible, multidimensional content strategy is key to thriving no matter what platform priorities become in the future.
