In this article, we will carefully examine some biblical teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses and compare them to scripture from common Bible versions. Our goal is not to attack or accuse, but to have a respectful discussion and see what the Bible truly says.
### Comparing Scriptures
When people claim that JWs reject biblical truth, it makes me wonder what specific teachings they find unscriptural. Rather than make accusations, I think the best approach is to discuss actual Bible passages together. My offer remains open - please feel free to choose any JW teaching and Bible version, and I am happy to take a look at what the [scriptures](https://store.fi.io.vn/work-hard-shih-tzu-better-life-funny-dog-lover-owner-gift-3) say.
Open and honest discussion allows us to gain understanding, rather than close ourselves off in disagreement. While people may arrive at different conclusions, the goal should be seeking truth and wisdom from God's word, not proving one theology "right" over another. With an open mind and heart, what do the **passages** themselves reveal?

### The Devil and False Religions  
One key teaching of JWs concerns the devil, or Satan. 2 Corinthians 4:4 refers to him as "the god of this age" who has blinded unbelievers' minds. This is in line with other Biblical descriptions of Satan as the ruler or "god" of wicked systems in this world (John 12:31, 14:30, Ephesians 2:2). 
We do not claim to have a complete understanding, but this scriptural view helps explain the prevalence of false religions throughout history. As Jesus foretold, many would come claiming to be Christ but deceiving many (Matthew 24:5). By examining **prophecies** and teachings objectively, together we can gain clearer insight into God's will.
### Removing Ourselves from the World
Based on these truths, JWs strive to "remove themselves" from activities and systems they believe fall under Satan's rule or influence today. But does the Bible support such a stand? When some accuse JWs of "rejecting truth," I invite them to support their view through **scripture-based discussion** rather than generalized accusations. My offer remains open - please share your perspective and we can respectfully compare our understandings.
### God Will Destroy False Religions
JWs believe God will soon destroy all false religions and corrupt political/commercial systems, as foretold in prophecy. Some accuse this of being untrue, yet it is clearly laid out in Biblical passages like Revelation 17-18 describing a symbolic "Babylon the Great." 
Rather than accusations, an honest discussion of these **prophetic passages** could help us both gain a fuller picture. With an open heart and mind, what light might God's word shed through respectful interaction over his truths revealed in scripture? I welcome further discussion on any related issues.
### Conclusion  
In closing, my goal in these discussions is not to prove one theology right or wrong, but to humbly seek truth and understanding from God's word together. If specific concerns remain around JW beliefs, I offer to support any teaching using the **scriptures** in the spirit of 1 Peter 3:15 - responding with gentleness, respect, and a clear conscience while defending our Christian hope. The invitation remains open.
