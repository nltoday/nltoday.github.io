## Understanding FPS and Graphics Settings
Roblox games are driven by frames per second or FPS. Higher FPS results in smoother gameplay. However, FPS can be limited by your computer hardware and Roblox's default 60 FPS cap. There are several ways to potentially boost FPS.
### Checking Graphics Settings
The first step is checking your in-game graphics settings. Graphics settings like view distance and shadows/effects have a significant impact on performance. [Reducing graphics quality settings](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/dog) can free up resources for more FPS. Take note of any quality presets like "Low" or "Fast" which automatically optimize settings.

### Evaluating Your Hardware
Your computer's hardware determines its overall performance and FPS ceiling. Key hardware includes the **graphics card/GPU, CPU, and RAM**. Older/weaker components may struggle to run Roblox smoothly even at lower settings. An upgraded or standalone **graphics card like Nvidia or AMD solutions** can boost FPS the most by offloading rendering tasks. 
### Monitoring Utilization
Check your hardware utilization during gameplay using tools like the Windows Task Manager. Spikes in CPU or GPU usage at 100% indicate bottlenecks limiting performance. Sustained high usage of certain components also hints at potential upgrades. Memory/RAM usage over 90% also deserves attention.
## Unlocking the FPS Cap with RFU
A popular method to boost FPS beyond 60 is using a **Roblox FPS Unlocker like RFU**. By removing the FPS cap, your system can render as many frames as possible based on its capabilities. This provides the smoothest possible experience for high-end PCs. 
### How RFU Works
The **RFU program runs discreetly in the background after installation**. Upon launching, it removes Roblox's hardcoded 60 FPS limit. You can then select a higher cap like 120, 165 or unlimited via an on-screen menu. Joining a game immediately displays the benefits with a dramatically smoother response.
### Compatibility and Usage
**RFU works seamlessly across different versions of Roblox games and apps**. Just re-download the latest version when prompted to keep compatibility. There is minimal setup and it conveniently updates itself. However, systems with weaker CPUs/GPUs may overload and see reduced FPS instead of a boost. 
## Optimizing Your Hardware Setup
For the best possible Roblox performance, both hardware and software optimization are important. Low-spec PCs require compromises between quality and smoothness. There are a few approaches to boost an aging rig:
### Upgrading the Graphics Card
A dedicated **mid-range GPU like the GTX 1060 or RX 580** provides a very noticeable upgrade over integrated graphics. Games no longer strain the CPU for rendering. Combined with a capable CPU, 100+ FPS becomes achievable at high settings.
### Increasing System RAM
4GB systems really struggle to run many current games. Upping **RAM to 8GB or more allows Roblox to cache more textures and assets** in memory. This reduces overall lag and stuttering even at lower settings. 8GB should be minimum for a smoother experience.
### Improving the CPU
On very old dual-core CPUs, individual weak cores become a limiting factor. A modern **quad-core CPU from the last 5 years** ensures multiple Roblox processes can run smoothly. The extra threads eliminate freezing when multitasking as well.
## Optimizing Software and Settings
With optimized hardware in place, a few software tweaks can wring out the most performance:
### Disabling Background Apps  
Close all non-essential programs and services to free up RAM and CPU resources. Unused apps in the background still consume a portion of your PC's capacity.
### Custom Graphics Settings
The low presets aren't always properly optimized. Manually modify individual graphics options like view distance, shadows and effects based on your system. Test different combos to find the smooth gameplay sweet spot. 
### Overclocking if Possible
For compatible CPUs and GPUs, a mild and stable overclock applied within safe parameters can provide 5-10% extra performance at no cost. This small boost helps maintain high frame rates. Always monitor temperatures closely.
### Using FPS Boosting Tools Strategically  
Alongside graphics optimization, third-party tools like RFU can give older configs an extra push. But overload protection is vital - capping FPS below perceived limits prevents unnecessary stress on components.
Overall through some effort, even lower-end PCs become quite capable of enjoying Roblox smoothly at acceptable levels of quality. With each incremental optimization, the gameplay experience improves bit by bit. By fully understanding your system, every last drop of performance can be wrung out safely.
