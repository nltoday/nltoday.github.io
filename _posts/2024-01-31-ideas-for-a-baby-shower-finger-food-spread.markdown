Most baby showers involve light snacks and appetizers that are easy to eat with your hands. Here are some great options to consider for your baby shower finger food spread.
### [Finger sandwiches and mini wraps](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/dog-mom)
Finger sandwiches such as cucumber, pimento cheese, chicken salad and egg salad are pretty, tasty and savory options. You can also make mini wrap sandwiches rolled up and held together with a toothpick. Turkey, ham and cheese or peanut butter and banana are tasty wrap fillings. Silver dollar sandwiches cut into bite-sized rounds are another cute idea.

### **Skewers and bites on sticks** 
Fruit skewers are always a crowd-pleaser. Alternate chunks of pineapple, grapes, strawberries and melons on a stick. You could also make savory skewers with mozzarella balls, cherry tomatoes and fresh basil leaves. Meatballs are another handheld option, especially if served with toothpicks in a warm crockpot sauce. Bacon wrapped dates are a delicious savory-sweet treat.
### **Assorted dips and dippers**
Setting out a variety of dips with an array of dippers is an easy way to satisfy different tastes. Hummus, spinach dip, pesto dip or tzatziki paired with pita chips, tortilla chips or fresh veggie sticks like carrot, celery and cucumber all make **grab-and-go appetizers**. You could portion the dips into individual ramekins or serve family style in bowls with scoops or chips on the side. 
### **Croissant sandwiches**
While not as visually appealing as tiny sandwiches, homemade croissant sandwiches filled with deli meat, cheese and fresh veggies are incredibly delicious. Mix one part **deli meat and veggie-filled mini croissant sandwiches** dill spread or herb spread with one part mayonnaise to add flavor. Slice croissants in half widthwise and spread the mixture before adding your fillings of choice and holding together with toothpicks. Turkey, cucumber and lettuce is a fresh springtime combination.
### **Smoked salmon bites** 
For something a bit more elegantly presented, arrange bite-sized smoked salmon, cream cheese and caper toasts on a platter. Thinly sliced bread like focaccia or a packaged loaf of French bread makes perfect individual toast "points." Simply top each round with a dollop of cream cheese, a thin slice of salmon and a caper for a pretty hors d'oeuvre guests can easily eat in one or two bites. 
### **Seasonal tarts**
Individual hand pies or tarts are always a special addition to any appetizer spread. Try **caramelized onion and pear tarts**, spinach and feta or classic chicken pot pies with dough in mini muffin tins. You can also fill phyllo dough triangles with cream cheese, spinach and artichoke or other favorite combinations. Serve warm or at room temperature alongside the other snacks.
### **Refreshing beverages**
No party is complete without something to drink. Set out a punch bowl of icy **fizzy fruit punch** made from lemon-lime soda, orange juice and your favorite berries. Don't forget the water too. Small bottles of flavored seltzer water like lemon, lime or fruit flavors are another refreshing choice guests will appreciate.
With this variety of dainty appetizers, your baby shower guests will be satisfied until the main meal is served. The assortment of flavors, colors and textures ensures something for every taste. With minimal prep required for the recipes, you can relax and enjoy celebrating too! Let me know if you need any recipes for the dishes mentioned.
