## Trust Your Instinct and Follow Baby's Lead
As others have stated, almonds and even almond butter can pose a choking hazard for infants who do not have teeth. While almond butter mixed with breastmilk or formula can be introduced in small amounts, other more nutritious options are preferable. Consult your pediatrician before introducing new foods. 
Instead of worrying too much about following strict schedules or guidelines, pay attention to your baby's [individual development](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-christmas-lights-funny-xmas-dog-lover-104-chihuahua-dog) and **readiness cues**. Babies will show interest in what you eat and are learning to integrate new tastes and textures into their diet. Respect your baby's signals and allow them to explore at their own pace.
### Observing Baby's Exploration with Food
With my second child, I closely observed for signs he was ready to start exploring solids. When he watched us eat and seemed interested, I offered small tastes. At first he experimented by mouthing and spitting out foods. I relaxed and let him learn without pressure or expectations. Breastmilk remained the primary source of nutrition. 
Over subsequent meals, he slowly integrated more tastes and textures as his developmental skills progressed. I let him set the pace and stopped offerings when he lost interest. This nurtured healthy eating habits from an early age.

## Nutritious First Foods to Explore
Once babies show signs of readiness between 4-6 months, safe first foods to explore include:
### Smooth Purees 
Introduce single-ingredient purees one at a time to monitor for any reactions. Good first options include avocado, sweet potatoes, butternut squash, bananas and apples. Continue breastfeeding regularly.
### Cereals Mixed with Breastmilk
Rice cereal mixed with breastmilk is a nutritious first food. High-iron cereals like oatmeal can also be introduced gradually. Coconut milk or formula are alternatives to breastmilk for mixing.
### Bread Crumbs and Vegetables
Soft bread crumbs and mashed vegetables provide important textures and nutrients. Start with mild options like cooked green beans, carrots or sweet potatoes. Beans are excellent sources of plant-based protein and iron.
## Introducing Finger Foods 
As babies gain better **hand-eye coordination** and **pincer grasp skills**, they can start exploring self-feeding with finger foods:
### Soft, Easy to Grasp Pieces
Pieces of soft banana, avocado or melon allow babies to pick up independently without choking risk. Melon is high in immune-boosting vitamin C. 
### Small Pieces of soft-cooked Vegetables
Well-mashed pieces of steamed broccoli, carrots or green beans provide important nutrients. Watch for choking risks and ensure pieces are very small. 
### Small Half Raisins or Dried Fruit Bits 
For dried fruit, cut raisins in half to prevent choking. Their natural sugars boost energy levels. Ensure safety by supervising self-feeding closely.
## Expanding the Menu with Family Meals
By **6-8 months**, babies can join family meals as they gain skills:  
### Enjoying Smashed Versions of Regular Meals
Let babies try smashed versions of what the family eats by mashing meats, grains and vegetables very well with a fork. Offering a variety introduces diverse flavors.
### Self-Feeding with Finger Foods
Continue increasing **texture and size variety** for finger foods as dexterity grows. Popular options at this stage include soft cooked pasta pieces, slices of avocado and pieces of toast. 
### Introducing soft cooked whole grains
Whole grain cereals like quinoa, barley or soft cooked oats provide important nutrients. Mashing ensures smooth texture at this stage. Continue breastfeeding or formula regularly.
## Introducing Potential Allergens
For babies at **high risk** of developing allergies like severe eczema or egg allergy, introduce top allergens like peanut products, eggs and wheat cautiously:  
### Starting Potential Allergens between 4-6 Months 
The NIH-sponsored guidelines recommend introducing peanut products and potential allergens to high-risk babies through regular consumption starting at 4-6 months. Work closely with your pediatrician.
### Monitor Reactions and Continue Regular Exposure
Introduce slowly in small amounts under supervision of a health professional. Stop offerings only if a concerning reaction occurs. Continuing regular consumption throughout early childhood helps prevent allergies developing.
## Trusting Your Parental Intuition
All babies develop at their own pace. With relaxed and responsive feeding, respect for baby's fullness and interest cues, babies thrive. Respect your baby's signals and let them guide the process of exploring complex new flavors, textures and self-feeding skills on their journey to family meals.
