### Discoverability Through Hashtags
Hashtags have long been a crucial tool for discoverability on Instagram. By including relevant hashtags in your posts, you make it possible for people searching specific topics or interests to find your content. The same principle applies to Instagram Reels. 
Using hashtags strategically in your Reels allows more people to discover and engage with your videos. Some key things to keep in mind when adding hashtags to Reels include choosing topics that relate directly to your content, industry, or niche. You'll also want to preference more popular and commonly used hashtags to maximize reach while still maintaining relevance. 
As with posts, it's generally recommended applying between 5-10 hashtags per Reel. Avoid overly generic tags that won't provide value, and be sure to stay within Instagram's character limit for hashtags. Proper hashtag selection and implementation can go a long way in surfacing your Reels to new viewers.

### Optimizing Hashtag Usage
When applying hashtags, it's worthwhile to consider tiering them based on popularity and follower count. For instance, you may include:
- 5 to 7 highly popular hashtags in the millions of uses 
- 8 to 10 hashtags in the hundreds of thousands of uses
- A few lesser used but still relevant hashtags
Tiering your hashtags helps ensure your content can benefit from exposure through both top trending hashtags as well as longtail, niche-specific tags. It's also good practice to regularly monitor hashtag performance and adjust your list over time based on engagement metrics.
Pay attention to which hashtags generate the most likes, comments, saves and shares. These indicate strong relevance and affiliation between your content and that particular hashtag. Focus tagging efforts around high-converting hashtags to maximize discovery potential. Hashtag experimentation is key for optimization.
### Tracking Hashtag Performance 
Unlike posts, there isn't currently a way to check Reel hashtag insights or track click-through directly within Instagram. However, there are some workarounds for analyzing hashtag performance. 
One method is to paste your Reel URL into the Instagram search bar along with the hashtags used. This will surface any instances where that specific Reel appeared in hashtag pages. You can then view metrics like likes, comments and saves as indicators of engagements from hashtag clicks. 
Another option is using third-party social media analytics tools with Instagram integration. Many platforms provide hashtag reports showing how much traffic and engagement various hashtags are driving to your profile and Reels specifically. With data-driven insights, you can continually improve hashtag strategy over time.
### Establishing Hashtag Authority
Long-term hashtag authority takes consistent, strategic use of targeted tags over an extended period. Beyond immediate discovery benefits, developing a strong hashtag presence serves to strengthen your credibility and positioning as a leader within that topic space. 
Some ways to establish hashtag authority include creating original [hashtag branded content](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-sunflower-you-are-my-world-shirt-chihuahua-lovers-female-tshirt-dog-themed-gifts3549-t-shirt) specifically for high-volume hashtag pages. Curating relevant posts from others using the same tags shows support for the community and increases your contribution and visibility within those conversations over time.
Authority is also bolstered through collaborative efforts like encouraging followers to engage with your hashtagged content or joining existing discussions happening under certain hashtags. Hashtag leveraging requires patience, but laying meaningful groundwork cultivates trusted expertise, followership and ultimately more exposure through hashtag discovery pathways.
### Implementing Hashtag Strategy Across Platforms  
A cohesive multi-platform approach can amplify results from Instagram hashtagging. For instance, linking relevant Reels together by **hashtagging matching TikTok videos** extends discovery potential into that app's viral ecosystem as well. You can also promote highlighted hashtags across other owned profiles on channels like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
Consistently posting Instagram Reels with optimized hashtags while also integrating the same tags into related third-party content widens the discovery net exponentially. Don't forget to utilize hashtags consistently in regular Reel and Story updates too for added layering. A thoughtful, integrated cross-platform hashtag strategy using the tactics above ensures Reels gain maximum reach.
### Measuring Success and Continual Testing
Proper tracking of hashtag click-throughs, views and other engagement metrics allows gauging true success of implementation over time. Pay attention to click-through rates specifically, as those indicate hashtags effectively driving traffic back to your Instagram profile. 
Regular A/B testing by tweaking hashtags used, placement within captions or frequency of updated Reels helps find the most optimized approach. Be willing to retire inefficient tags in favor of fresher alternatives as well. Consistent evaluation and refinement will continually sharpen your hashtagging skills for sustainable Reels growth.
