Preparing for JEE Main and Advanced exams is a challenging task with only 2 months left. However, it is still possible if you make an efficient study plan and work diligently. In this guide, we will discuss 8 crucial steps to help you maximize your preparation and score well in the exam.
### Develop a Study Schedule
The first step is to devise a structured weekly or monthly study schedule. **Divide your syllabus into chapters and assign timelines.** Make a list of all topics and prioritize the important and scoring ones. Schedule adequate time for revisions too. Stick to your schedule religiously. 
Build your schedule based on the advice given in the input. Focus first on the basic and high-weightage topics from Physics, Inorganic Chemistry, and areas requiring practice in Maths. **Leave time for weekly tests using practice apps like Marks App for free unlimited mock tests.**

### Master High-Priority Concepts
Identify 5-6 chapters each from Physics, Chemistry, and Maths that are considered fundamental and have high chances of questions. Make short notes/formula sheets of these chapters. **Spend at least 1 hour daily solving problems and practising questions from these topics.** Clarify all doubts and be fully confident in applying concepts quickly.
Mastering important concepts early will boost your preparation speed. Inorganic Chemistry topics like s-block, p-block elements and physical quantities from Physics are highly scoring and time-saving if prepared well. Solve previous year questions from these areas for practice.
### Take Practice Tests Regularly  
Regular practice tests are crucial to assess preparation, identify weak areas, and ace time management during the exam. **Schedule at least 1-2 full-length practice tests every week from this point.** Analyze your performance carefully to find gaps. Strengthen weaker topics immediately based on test analysis. 
Use free mock tests on Marks App as suggested for unlimited practice without any constraints. Mimic exam conditions and time duration to build speed and accuracy. Review solutions to fix any conceptual flaws.
### Learn efficiently Through Videos
**Watch one-shot chapter revision videos** for an overview and to fill gaps in understanding. Videos help learn at 2x speed and save a lot of time. NEET and JEE topper BounceBack series on YouTube is highly recommended for its concise explanations. 
Focus on important derivations, theory, numerical concepts and tricks through videos. Make short notes alongside for easy reference later. This will give your preparation the required depth in a fraction of usual time spent on books alone.
### Have a Backup Strategy  
It is prudent to have a fallback plan in case your target rank/percentile becomes unfeasible due to time constraints. **Lower down your goal to 93+ percentile instead of 99%.** 
Concentrate more on high-scoring chapters instead of the entire syllabus. Leave low weightage topics if needed.

Maintain consistency in the approach rather than over-burdening yourself.
### Stay Focused and Motivated
The final 2 months require immense dedication to keep you moving ahead. **Eliminate all distractions by avoiding social media completely during study hours.** Short breaks of 10 minutes after every 90 minutes will help retain concentration for longer. 
**Keep revisiting success stories and notes from top scorers** for motivation. Share preparation updates with friends to stay accountable. Maintain a positive mindset to keep stress at bay. **Have sufficient sleep, physical activities and a balanced diet** for mental and physical well-being.
### Manage Time Properly on Exam Day
Proper time management during the actual exam is crucial. As suggested, **practise previous year papers within given time constraints.** Note down approximate ideal time for each section. 
Keep 10% time left for last minute revisions. Solve questions you are confident about first to maintain pace. **Move on to the next problem instead of lingering on tougher ones.** Allot more time for your strong areas while finishing others on time.
### Believe in Yourself and Stay Focused
With diligent preparation and positive mindset, cracking JEE in 2 months is very much possible. **Have faith in your abilities and stay motivated during the final stages.** Avoid comparing yourself with others. Give your best shot through the last few tests. 
**All the very best for your upcoming exams! You've got this.** Do share your success story to help motivate others. Consistency and discipline can help you achieve your target scores even at this late stage. Work smart as advised here for maximum results.
