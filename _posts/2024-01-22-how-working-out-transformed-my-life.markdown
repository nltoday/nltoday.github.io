### The Beginning of My Journey
Weighing around 113 kg, I led an unhealthy lifestyle. I would wake up, eat processed foods throughout the day without caring about my health, and spend my time wasting away instead of being productive. As a result, I became lazy, fat and lost my confidence. One day, I was fed up with the constant feeling of self-loathing and decided it was time for a change.
I started with a simple plan - go for walks after dinner and switch to healthier home-cooked meals. While it was difficult to stick with consistently, I pushed through the discouragement from others doubting my ability to change. After two months, I noticed improvements in my energy levels and discipline, even if the changes to my body were still minimal. This motivated me to continue.

### Running Became My Passion
I discovered how much I enjoyed running and it soon became my favorite activity. In the beginning, I could barely manage 500-800 meters before getting badly out of breath. But I kept at it, going a little farther each time. Gradually, my endurance and speed increased tremendously. Now, I am able to comfortably run 10km and feel proud of how far I have come. Running helped me understand the importance of consistency and pushing my limits in gradual steps.
### Focusing on a Balanced Lifestyle  
Along with running, I started [weight training at home with dumbbells](https://yt.io.vn/collection/agan) I purchased online. I made it a point to study different exercises and create a regimen that suited my needs, instead of following random routines. Around this time, I also learned the significance of balancing calorie intake with output and started counting my daily calorie consumption. These changes led to the sculpting of my muscles and a noticeable slimming down of my body. People began complimenting me on my transformation, fueling me to continue down my path of wellness.
### Nourishing My Body with Nutritious Foods
Junk food was no longer an option as I replaced them with healthier, nutritious alternatives. Vegetables, eggs, paneer and oats became dietary staples, along with regular protein shakes. Cheating on my diet was rare and I took pride in my self-discipline. This helped me maintain a strong and fit physique where I felt truly confident in my abilities. Managing a busy lifestyle was no longer an issue due to my newly acquired time management skills. 
### Discipline as a Way of Life 
Today, exercise and healthy living have become ingrained habits. I stand at 6 feet tall, weighing a solid 85kg with well-defined muscles. Losing over 25kg has been one of my biggest achievements yet. The changes went far beyond just my appearance - I overcame low self-esteem, gained self-belief and a more positive outlook. I learned the importance of discipline which translates to all aspects of my successful career and family life. Living an active lifestyle keeps my mind sharp and body feeling youthful even at 33 years of age. My journey proves that small, consistent efforts can lead to life-transforming results.
### Inspiring Others Through My Journey
Seeing my progress, friends and colleagues sought my advice on maintaining fitness levels. I shared my simple secrets - burning more calories than consuming through daily activity. Some were motivated to join zumba or swimming classes with me while others incorporated workouts into their routines. My positive transformation has helped me become a role model for healthy living. On this path of wellness, I feel committed to my one precious body and making good choices around nutrition, lifestyle habits and limiting harmful substances. This is how I strive to inspire others on prioritizing their health and happiness through an active lifestyle.
