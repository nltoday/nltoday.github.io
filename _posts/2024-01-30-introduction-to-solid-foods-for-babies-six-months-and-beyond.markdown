Babies are ready to start solid foods around six months of age when they meet certain developmental milestones like being able to sit up with support, have good head and neck control, and show interest in foods others are eating. Making this transition to solid foods gradually and carefully is important for baby's health and feeding skills. This article discusses important considerations for introducing solid foods including fish to baby at six months and beyond as well as addressing common concerns and questions around starting solids.
### Choosing Nutritious First Foods
When starting solids at around six months, stick to simple home-made foods that are mashed, pureed, or shredded to a smooth consistency baby can easily handle. Good first foods to offer include banana, mashed yellow squash, and [pureed peas](https://store.fi.io.vn/mommysaurus-mom-mom-2-kids1697-t-shirt) as these provide important nutrients baby needs and are unlikely to cause a food allergy reaction. At this age, baby only needs around 2-4 tablespoons of food per feeding so focus on nutrition and not large volumes. Their primary source of nutrition should still come from breastmilk or formula at this stage.

### Introducing **Fish** to Baby's Diet Safely
**Salmon** makes a good early fish choice for baby as it is high in healthy **omega-3 fatty acids** and other nutrients. However, it's crucial to thoroughly cook the fish by baking, boiling, or steaming until opaque all the way through before mashing or pureeing. Always remove any bones and skin which could be a choking hazard. Consulting the pediatrician is advised prior to introducing new foods like fish to ensure your baby's individual needs are met and signs of any allergies are watched for.
### Questions About Starting Solid Foods
Many parents wonder if store-bought baby food purees or cereals are necessary. The answer is no - simple home-cooked foods provide just as good, if not better, nutrition. **Salt** and added **sugar** should mostly be avoided for babies. **Honey** is not recommended until after 12 months due to risk of infant botulism. Purees gradually progress to soft chopped foods baby can feed themselves as they develop self-feeding skills from around six to eight months. Always supervise baby during meals and trust their hunger cues.
### Preparing Foods and Feeding Environment  
When cooking foods for baby, take extra care to thoroughly wash, peel or remove skin from fruits and vegetables. Always follow food safety guidelines for proper storage, cooking, cooling and reheating temperatures. Create a safe feeding space free of distractions to focus on developing healthy eating habits from the start. Elevate baby in a high chair, bouncer or infant seat so they are at a comfortable level to see and interact with caregiver during mealtime. Consider baby-led weaning where developmentally ready babies self-feed soft chopped foods for independence practice and sensory exposure.
### Frequently Asked Questions on Starting Solids 
Some common questions parents have when introducing solid foods include concerns over allergies, types of utensils, portions and frequency of feedings. Consult your pediatrician on their advice specific to your baby's needs and development. In general there is no need to delay starting solid foods at six months if developmental signs point to readiness. With guidance from your pediatrician, following baby's hunger cues and starting with basic home-cooked foods, this transition should go smoothly. Always stay watchful for signs infant may need adjustments in their feeding routine or foods offered.

Be patient, trust baby's feeding signs, and remember they are still getting most of their nutrition from breastmilk or formula at this stage. As finger and pincer grasps develop over months six to eight, start introducing **soft chopped foods** baby can pick up themselves for advancing self-feeding skills. Growth spurts, illness or travel may cause regressions - that's normal.
