### Getting started with programming
When starting out with learning how to code, one of the most important decisions to make is choosing which programming language to learn first. There are many excellent options available, each with their own strengths and pros and cons. Factors like what types of applications you want to build, previous experience, and popularity can all play a role in deciding the best starting point.

### Evaluating language options
Many popular scripting languages like [Lua](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-boston-terrier-american-flag-usa-patriotic-dog-lover-v-neck-t-shirt/men&), **JavaScript**, and **Python** provide gentle on-ramps into programming. Lua is commonly used for game scripting thanks to its simplicity and performance. As a ***multi-paradigm language***, JavaScript allows both frontend web development as well as building **cross-platform applications**. And Python is very beginner-friendly while also having diverse use cases across web, software, data science, and more. 
For building more complex applications, **Java** is a versatile option that remains one of the most commonly used languages. Its object-oriented design facilitates building robust, scalable software. While Java may have a steeper learning curve compared to scripting languages, mastering its fundamentals provides a solid foundation for other languages as well.
On the other hand, if you want to get into lower-level systems programming or game development, **C/C++** is worthwhile to learn down the line. But it's advisability as a first language depends on your specific goals and patience for complexity. Overall, there is no single "best" choice - the right starting point is highly individual.
### Leveraging existing knowledge and resources
If you have experience with other languages through school, work, or personal projects, that can shape your decision. For example, a background in **object-oriented concepts** would make Java a natural next step. Or web development skills could steer you towards JavaScript first. 
Another major factor is availability of learning resources. For example, the sheer volume of online tutorials, documentation, and courses for **JavaScript** and **Python** makes them extremely accessible starting points. Popular frameworks like React and Node.js for JS and data science libraries for Python open up many possibilities for practical application as well.
Your learning preferences also matter - some people thrive on structured paid courses while others prefer self-paced learning through free documentation and online content. Consider which approach suits you best and which languages are supported by high-quality materials either way. Overall the best starting language maximizes existing strengths while minimizing barriers to learning.
### Getting hands-on with sample projects
Once you've research your options and narrowed it down to a few top contenders, it's helpful to try them out through short sample projects. This allows you to evaluate a language based on real-world usage rather than abstract concepts. Simple apps are a great way to familiarize yourself with basic syntax, common paradigms like functions and classes, and available tooling.
For JavaScript, **building a calculator app** leveraging cross-browser DOM manipulation is a perfect beginner project. Python lends itself well to automating everyday tasks with **scripts and tools** - try building a desktop assistant. Java can shine with desktop **GUI apps** using Swing or Android development on mobile. C++ games emphasize fundamentals like data types and memory management in an engaging way. Trying out multiple starter projects gives invaluable insight into what feels most natural and enjoyable before committing fully.
### Sticking with your first language
Once you land on a language to begin with, it's important to see it through and build solid foundations rather than becoming distracted by shiny new options too quickly. Give yourself 6-12 months of regular practice to reach an intermediate competency. The concepts you learn will provide a **transferrable base** for picking up additional languages down the road much more smoothly versus starting over each time. Sticking with your initial choice makes the most of time invested vs jumping around without developing depth.
### Progressing beyond the basics
To keep making progress after tutorial resources, focus on building your own projects from the ground up. **“Learning by doing”** is crucial for cementing knowledge and gaining skills that real work demands but courses don't always provide. This may include practicing common design patterns, version controlling code, leveraging external APIs, and refactoring code to continue improving. Learning new techniques in the same language extends what's already built upon rather than repeating the learning curve. 
Professional experiences are another great way to continually grow. Contributing to **open source projects** puts skills to use on real codebases while expanding technical networks. Or exploring job opportunities, internships, freelancing allows applying classroom concepts in pragmatic, challenging work. Staying engaged through your interests keeps motivation high for the long-term mastery of any programming language.
### Wrapping things up
Choosing your initial language comes down to practical factors like personal strengths, career goals, and available resources rather than debates over languages in a vacuum. Every option has pros if used for the right purposes. Focus on the underlying concepts that translate between languages, get hands-on as much as possible, and commit to depth over constant change when starting out. With experience under your belt, you'll be in an excellent position to confidently tackle new languages and continue progressing your skills.
