## Lost Your Boarding Pass? Here's What You Can Do 
Finding yourself without your boarding pass can be stressful, but there are options available to replace it. Let's explore the steps you can take depending on the airline you traveled with.
### Contact Your Airline Directly
The first course of action is usually contacting the airline you traveled with directly. Have your booking reference number or PNR number handy, along with relevant flight details like dates and routes. **Most major airlines allow you to request a duplicate boarding pass online by entering these identifying details on their website.**
You can also call the airline's customer service line. Representatives there can check your travel history and issue a replacement boarding pass or a travel certificate as needed. **Airlines may charge a small nominal fee, usually around $5-10 USD for replacing lost boarding passes through this method.**

### Apply for a Travel Certificate 
If the airline is unable to reissue your boarding pass, you can request for a travel certificate instead. **This is an official document issued by the airline certifying that you traveled on the mentioned flight.** 
Provide your PNR number, full name, passport details, flight details and reason for needing a certificate when applying. The application process may involve filling an online form or a written request sent via email or post. **Expect to receive the travel certificate within 5-7 business days through email or post once approved.**
### Check Social Media for Help
Some airlines actively maintain social media profiles to engage with customers. Check the official pages or handles of the airline you flew with on **Facebook, Twitter or dedicated blog/community forums.** 
Describe your situation politely and ask if anyone could guide on how to obtain a replacement. **Fellow passengers may have faced similar issues in the past and can point you to the right resources or procedures unique to that carrier.** The airline staff themselves may also respond with direct assistance.
### Consider Third Party Travel Certificates 
As a last resort, you can explore options for third party issued travel certificates instead of one directly from the airline. **Services like Visa Application Centers, Embassies or specialized travel document providers can help issue travel certificates verifying your journey.** 
You will need to provide solid proof of travel like a baggage tag, airport photos or expense receipts along with basic details for them to certify the trip taken. **There may be additional fees involved with third party certificates compared to obtaining directly from airlines.**
## Dealing With Different Airlines and Situations
### Handling Domestic Flights Within a Country
For domestic flights within a country, the process is usually more straightforward. National carriers **like Indigo in India allow getting digital or paper duplicates of boarding passes through their app or website easily with basic details.[

### International Flights Requirements May Vary 
With international flights between countries, procedures could differ based on the airlines and departure/arrival points. **Check carrier websites under 'Lost Documents' or 'Reissue Ticket' sections for their specified protocol.** 
**Major global airlines like Emirates, British Airways, Lufthansa provide online forms to fill for replacement boarding passes or certificates by email within a few days usually.** 
Many **also have dedicated customer support helplines for your country of travel to assist over calls.** Having **travel itinerary, passport details and credit card used for booking will help fast track the process.** 
### Addressing Multiple Sectors Bookings 
If your ticket had multiple connections on different airlines, coordinating the replacement process could be slightly more involved. **Reach out to the main carrier of the itinerary with all PNR and IDs.**
**Request them to liaison with partner airlines involved to issue travel certificates covering the complete journey.** **Often having certificates from each individual carrier is not necessary as the main airline acts as the coordinator.**
### Tips for smooth replacement
To ensure seamless processing of your request: 
- Be **polite yet assertive** while describing the problem to airline agents  
- Have **id proofs, original tickets, receipts** if available for additional verification
- Specify clearly if replacement is needed for **records/audits or visa application** purposes
- Follow up after **a week if certificate is not delivered** to avoid delays
Staying patient yet persistent will help you obtain the required documents from airlines without hassles in most routine cases.
## How to Get a Boarding Pass for Travel Reimbursements or Company Claims
### Presenting Boarding Pass for Travel Billings  
For business trips or whenever travel expenditure is reimbursed by companies, **submission of boarding pass acts as the primary receipt.** 
So in cases of lost passes, it is crucial to furnish a suitable replacement document when sending expense reports. **Requesting airline travel certificates specifying passenger name, flight details and fare paid serves this purpose adequately.**
Some companies have internal portals for employees to directly **upload soft scanned copies of supporting documents like boarding passes or certificates during expense claim filing.**
Others may need the physical paper certificate to be attached with signed bills and forms sent via post/courier. **Consistently follow the standard operating procedures of your organization.**
### Attending Conferences and Getting Travel Allowance
Besides businesses, academic institutes and non-profits also sponsor travel of staff and participants. Here too, **producing boarding pass receipts qualifies reimbursements and allowances.**
**For attending conferences abroad, requests for duplicates should be made promptly citing the institutional event affiliation.** Mentioning participation certificate requirements at registration may help airlines prioritize such cases.
Additionally, authorized event organizers can directly write designated travel signatures on third party certificates issued to delegate travel verification needs if airlines deny replacements.
### Insuring Against Future Document Loss Risks 
To prevent problems encountered due to missing receipts at later stages:
- **Click photos of all travel documents** like tickets and boarding passes on mobile during journey
- Consider **scanning travel docs and storing digitally** in organized folders 
- Check if your **travel insurance provides coverage** for costs incurred while replacing important travel papers
Adopting such precautions will ensure smooth expense management and claim settlement even if original receipts are misplaced somewhere down the line.
## Wrapping Up
In summary, approaching your travelled airline directly through websites, apps or call centers is the most preferred way to obtain replacement boarding passes and travel certificates. Airline response time and processes may vary depending on the travel route and purpose. 
Having relevant booking details handy and following standard document submission guidelines of your company saves time and effort. With digital travel becoming the norm, proactively scanning important papers for records is a prudent practice to adopt.
With patience and right information, one can certainly get acceptable substitutes for lost boarding passes accepted globally without much hassle in routine cases.
