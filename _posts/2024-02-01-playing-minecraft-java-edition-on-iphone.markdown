Minecraft is a popular sandbox video game originally created by Swedish game developer Markus "Notch" Persson and later developed and published by Mojang. While the Bedrock Edition of Minecraft is available on iOS platforms, the original Java Edition cannot be downloaded directly from the App Store due to Apple's restrictions. However, it is still possible to play Minecraft Java Edition on an iPhone through a process called sideloading. Sideloading allows players to install and run apps not available on the App Store by bypassing Apple's review process. This guide will explain the step-by-step process to sideload and play [Minecraft Java Edition](https://store.fi.io.vn/cute-axolotl-funny-i-axolotl-questions-salamander-265/men&) on your iPhone.
### Downloading PojavLauncher
PojavLauncher is a lightweight launcher that allows iPhone and Android users to play the official **Minecraft Java Edition** game on their mobile devices. The first step is to visit the [PojavLauncher GitHub page](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/releases) and download the latest .ipa file release under the "Assets" section. This file contains the compiled PojavLauncher app that will be sideloaded to your iPhone.

### Setting Up Sideloading with Sideloadly 
The next step is to set up a PC-based sideloading tool to install the PojavLauncher .ipa file. Sideloadly is a free and open-source sideloading solution that supports installing IPA files without a paid Apple developer account. Download and install Sideloadly from their [official website](https://sideloadly.io/). Once installed, connect your iPhone to your PC with a Lightning cable. Sideloadly will automatically detect your iOS device.
### Installing PojavLauncher
To install PojavLauncher, open the downloaded .ipa file in Sideloadly and click "Install". You will be prompted to sign in with an Apple ID - this can be an existing account or a new dummy account created just for sideloading. Enter your Apple ID credentials and click "Install" again. Sideloadly will silently install the app to your iPhone without revoking any other installed apps.
### Launching Minecraft Java Edition
Once installed, you can find the PojavLauncher icon on your iPhone home screen. Open the app and log in with your Mojang/Minecraft account credentials. The launcher will download the necessary game files and you can then click "Play" to launch **Minecraft Java Edition**! The game should run smoothly at reasonable settings depending on your iPhone model. You're now all set to enjoy Minecraft Java Edition on the go!
### Alternative Sideloading Methods
While Sideloadly is very easy to use, there are a few other alternatives if you prefer. AltStore is another popular free sideloading solution, however it requires Xcode on macOS to initially set up. iTunes can also sideload apps in Developer mode, but it requires an annual $99 developer account. Jailbreaking is not necessary nowadays thanks to advancements in sideloading without a developer profile.
### Frequently Asked Questions
### # Why is Minecraft Written in Java?
Minecraft started as a personal project by Notch, who was comfortable programming in Java. It was simpler to continue development in the same language rather than rewrite the entire codebase. Java also allows cross-platform compatibility between Windows, Linux, and Mac versions.
### # How Often is PojavLauncher Updated?  
The PojavLauncher project is actively maintained with periodic bug fixes and feature updates. Major version releases adding new Minecraft versions or significant improvements are released approximately once every 2-3 months. It's recommended to keep PojavLauncher updated to the latest version for best performance and compatibility.
### # Can Other Java Games be Played as Well?
In theory, any Java game that works with a standard Java launcher should be playable through PojavLauncher. However, due to hardware limitations on mobile devices, performance may vary greatly depending on the game. Minecraft remains the most fully supported and optimized title.
