### How Brave Rewards Works
At the heart of Brave Browser is its opt-in Rewards program. Once enrolled, you'll start seeing privacy-preserving ads from Brave's advertising partners. These are markedly different from traditional intrusive ads - they are less frequent, more relevant, and you are compensated for viewing them. Over time, the Brave Ad platform aims to reshape online advertising for the better of users, publishers and advertisers alike.
Brave deposits a portion of the advertising revenue directly into your Brave Rewards wallet as BAT each month based on your estimated **attention paid to eligible ads**. The more ads you view and the longer your sessions, the more BAT you can earn - typically $3-5 per month on average but it depends on your usage. Your balance accrues over time, and you can choose to keep the BAT, tip sites you visit, or convert them to cash or cryptocurrency like Bitcoin.
### Ways To Increase Your Brave Earnings
While the basic Brave Rewards program is quite generous on its own, there are some additional ways you can boost your monthly BAT payouts:
- Verify your identity by providing some basic info like your email. This doubles the amount of ads shown and doubled contributions.
- Add more devices like your mobile phone or additional computers where you browse frequently. Each active device increases earning potential. 
- Extend browsing sessions for longer periods during the day. longer visits correlate to higher estimated attention and rewards. 
- Customize your Brave ad categories and interests. Tailored ads maximize relevance for better earnings estimations.
- Refer friends and family via your referral link. Earn a share of what they earn through Braveâ€™s referral program.
