### Ash's Early Safari Zone Adventures
Ash and his friends arrive at the **Safari Zone Pokémon** area excited to explore and catch new Pokémon. However, they receive a stern warning from the [Safari Zone Warden Kaiser](https://store.fi.io.vn/cute-schipperke-dog-art-schipperke-gift-119-1) who is armed with a gun. Kaiser explains the **strict Safari Zone rules** and even aims the gun at Ash's head to demonstrate that he will enforce the rules by any means necessary. The group is shocked by Kaiser's threatening behavior but understand they must follow the rules while in the Safari Zone.

### A Glimpse into Kaiser's Past  
While in Kaiser's office, Ash and Misty notice a old photo of Kaiser as a young boy standing next to a **Dratini, the rare Dragon-type Pokémon**. When they ask about it, Kaiser snatches the photo away insisting the Dratini is just a rumor. Later, Professor Oak explains to Ash that 30 years ago, Kaiser was the one who discovered Dratini in the Safari Zone. However, **too many trainers flocking to the area destroyed the delicate ecosystem**. The Dratini was never seen again, leaving only memories and that single photograph.
### Team Rocket's Dratini Scheme
Overhearing Ash's conversation, **Team Rocket** hatches a plan to capture Dratini and all the Pokémon in the Safari Zone. They threaten Kaiser at gunpoint to reveal the location of Dratini, tickling him with a mecha when he refuses. Kaiser eventually cracks and informs them Dratini lives in **Dragon Valley**. Team Rocket prepares to execute their devious scheme.  
### A Rivalry is Born in the Safari Zone 
Team Rocket challenges Ash and his friends to a competition - whoever catches more Pokémon wins. If Ash wins, Team Rocket will leave them alone forever. But if Team Rocket wins, they get to steal all of Ash's Pokémon. Ever competitive, Ash accepts the challenge confident in his Pokémon catching skills. 
### Showdown at Dragon Valley
Team Rocket tracks down Dratini at its hidden lake habitat. But just as they're about to grab Dratini, Ash and the others interrupt. Jessie reveals she already defeated Ash since he used all his Safari Balls. She tosses an electric bomb into the water that will shock all the Pokémon to the surface. Ash dives in after it to save the Pokémon.
### Rescuing Dratini from Team Rocket's Scheme
Underwater, Ash runs out of air before reaching the bomb. Suddenly, a storm erupts and the legendary **Dragonair** emerges, saving Ash. Ash returns the bomb to Team Rocket, blasting them off. Kaiser realizes the Dragonair is the grown Dratini from long ago. Dratini has a child of its own now, reuniting the group after 30 years. 
### Farewell to the Safari Zone
Back at the office, Professor Oak realizes Ash unfortunately only managed to catch 30 Tauros during his Safari Zone visit. Ash and friends bid farewell to Kaiser, Dratini and Dragonair. Though their adventure was cut short, they helped protect the rare Pokémon who call the Safari Zone home.
### The Plot Hole Created by Banning
Sadly, due to its dark tone and realistic gun scenes, this episode was banned in most countries. As a result, its non-airing generated confusion for international viewers about how and why Ash obtained 30 Tauros. To this day it remains one of the rare **banned Pokémon episodes** that created an noticeable continuity issue in the anime.
