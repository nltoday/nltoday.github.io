## Multiple Logical Flaws Invalidate the Core Argument
John Mandlbaur's draft compares a theoretical prediction without external torques to experimental observations that necessarily include external torques. **This comparison of non-equivalent systems is logically invalid** and undermines the entire argument. 
### Comparing Apples to Oranges
The draft predicts the rotational behavior of an ideal system without any external influences. However, real experiments are necessarily impacted by friction, air resistance, imperfections in materials and equipment, and other external torques. **Directly comparing a frictionless theoretical model to real-world observations with friction is bound to produce discrepancies.**

### Failing to Control for Key Variables  
For the experimental results to validate or invalidate the theoretical prediction, the experiment must eliminate or account for all relevant external torques. **Merely observing a difference without eliminating confounding variables is insufficient to disprove an established scientific theory.**
## Elementary Student Examples Do Not Constitute Rigorous Experiments
The core argument relies on comparing a thought experiment from an introductory physics textbook to observations of complex real-world systems. However, **textbook examples are meant to illustrate basic concepts, not serve as the basis for theoretical challenges.**
### Overgeneralizing from Idealizations 
Introductory examples intentionally ignore complicating factors like friction to highlight fundamental principles. **Directly applying conclusions from such oversimplified models to real systems ignores the impact of neglected variables.**  
### Lack of Methodological Rigor
For a challenge to established theory to be taken seriously, it requires actual experiments following scientific method principles like controlling variables, replicability, peer review. **Merely observing real systems behave differently than a word problem provides no evidence of a flaw in theory.**
## Refusal to Engage With Identified Flaws Undermines Credibility
The draft's logical flaws have been pointed out numerous times by commenters familiar with physics. However, **the author ignores or dismisses all criticisms without valid rebuttals.**
### Unwillingness to Consider Alternative Explanations
Rather than entertain the possibilities that his experimental design was inadequate or misunderstandings occurred, **the author insists the established theory must be wrong without clear evidence.**
### Closed-Mindedness Prevents Progress  
For a new hypothesis to gain traction, the proponent must demonstrate thorough understanding of the existing framework and engagement with attempts to verify claims. **Dismissing all scrutiny damages credibility and hinders useful discussion.**
## Lack of Technical Expertise Is a Major Limitation
As someone with just an introductory physics education decades prior, **the author is not equipped with the in-depth knowledge needed to identify subtle issues or propose a viable alternative framework**.
### Understanding Takes Time and Practice
Grasping advanced physical theories like classical mechanics or relativity requires years of study, experimentation, and refinement of intuitions. **One cannot expect to find flaws that eluded experts without equivalent expertise.**
### Overconfidence Outstrips Actual Ability  
While enthusiastic questioning of "truths" drives progress, **amateurs lacking deep experience in a field will predictably misunderstand or oversimplify issues obvious to professionals.** True insights come through rigorous study, not force of will alone.
## Conclusion: The Claims Remain Entirely Unconvincing
In summary, this draft's core argument is invalidated by logical flaws in comparing equivalent systems. Its methodology lacks scientific rigor, and the author refuses to acknowledge limitations or engage substantially with criticisms. **Absent clear evidence and responses to well-founded scrutiny, these outlier claims against the consensus of experts remain unjustified speculations, not a legitimate challenge to physics.** Further progress would require revisiting this issue with a more open and skeptical mindset combined with deeper training.
