### Gone with the Current  
Ekta and four other girls from her MBA class decided to spend their term break in Goa enjoying various water sports. Ekta was particularly excited about trying banana boat riding. However, little did she know the hilarious embarrassment she would face due to her inability to swim. When the boatman turned their banana boat upside down in the middle of the sea, none of the girls knew how to swim back to shore on their own. In a panic, Ekta clung onto the boatman's shoulder threatening to take her back. They all made it back safely in the end, but Ekta would face another bigger embarrassment about this "life-threatening" experience back in class.

### An Unintentional Comedy Act
When the class resumed after the break, Ekta's professor was trying to wake up the drowsy students by asking about their term break experiences. Eager to impress her crush teacher, Ekta enthusiastically shared the details of her banana boat ride in Goa. However, in her excitement, she failed to mention the boat and over-emphasized the part where she and four other girls were clinging onto a "[big banana](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/alber)" together, gasping for air when it was turned upside down. The whole class erupted in laughter at Ekta's unintentionally hilarious storytelling. Only later did she realize the double meaning she had created, leaving her utterly embarrassed. 
### Schadenfreude Amid Awkwardness
Scolding a wrong student in front of the whole class is every student's nightmare. But for one unlucky classmate of mine, it happened during a unit test in **Thermodynamics** class, which was taken by our strict college principal himself. When most students scored low, the principal called students one by one to return their answer sheets. In a case of mistaken identity, he loudly scolded a student for scoring just one mark. The poor guy received the wrath for good five minutes before realizing the error. While the teacher felt terribly guilty, the real culprit had to face double embarrassment when his actual zero mark was announced.
### A Well-Intended Prank Gone Wrong
We all have that one friend who loves cracking silly jokes at the most inappropriate times. Rumi, my colleague and best friend, was one such person who found serious project meetings the perfect opportunity to prank me. During one critical discussion about solving a bug, I was eagerly waiting for my lunch break since I had skipped breakfast. Noticing my hunger pangs, my manager kindly asked if I wanted to leave for food first. But before I could respond, Rumi butted in with a lame Hindi wordplay on my name associating it to being always "null" or empty in the "**stomach**". The entire room burst out laughing at the childish joke, leaving me red-faced with embarrassment.  
### Caught Red-Handed in the Act 
Class presentations are a time to showcase one's knowledge and public speaking skills. But for one unlucky student, it turned out to be a complete disaster due to careless mistakes. When his topic on **solar energy** generation came up, he confidently started explaining different concepts using a powerpoint slide. However, mid-presentation he realized with horror that one of the diagrams he was referring to was actually from a adult website! Before he could remove the slide, a classmate had noticed and blurted it out loudly, sending the entire auditorium into peals of laughter. The poor guy turned beetroot red and ran out of class in humiliation. His choice of "study material" would be a subject of classroom jokes for many days to come.
### Making a Big Spectacle of Oneself 
Airplane travel involves many possibilities of unintended comedy through little mistakes or lack of awareness. During one of my flights, an elderly man sitting next to me was struggling with airsickness. When the cabin crew passed by with refreshments, he forgot all manners in his nausea and loudly yelled "Water! I need water!". However, in his sickness induced haze, he forgot to say please. The flight attendant coldly replied saying manners were important. Mortified, the man turned to me pleading to ask for water on his behalf since he was too embarrassed now. I did so, reminding the crew about kindness even in small mistakes, getting him the requested water in the end. His red face showed he'd learned a lesson the loud way!
### An Honest Blunder Leading to Laughter
Having a forgetful nature often lands me in hilarious goof-ups. During one meeting with an important client, my boss listed down points to be covered. When my turn came to present, I opened with "Good afternoon everyone. Now coming to the first point..." and drew a complete blank. Trying to jog my memory I blurted out "Wait, let me check what the first point is from Boss' notes..." The silence was instantly broken by bursts of laughter in the room as they realized I had forgotten what I was supposed to speak! While I wished the ground could swallow me then, my honest mistake did help lighten the formal environment later. Even my boss saw the humour adding he would make sure to "remind my notes to myself next time".
