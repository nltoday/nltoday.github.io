## Getting Started
The first step is to go to http://roblox.com/create and click on "Manage my experiences." From there, go to your group's creations and select the group you want to add clothing items to. Scroll down to click on "Shirts" where you can upload image files of your clothing designs. 
### Preparing Your Clothing Designs
Be sure the images you upload meet ROBLOX's size, file type, and content guidelines. Images should be less than 1MB in file size and in JPG, PNG or BMP format.

## Moderation and Approval Process
All uploaded items go through ROBLOX's moderation process before appearing in the catalog. This helps ensure only appropriate content is available. Items may be rejected if they violate ROBLOX's Community Standards. 
### Common Rejection Reasons
Common reasons for rejection include **inappropriate images**, **vulgar text**, **copyright issues** and more. Be sure to review ROBLOX's guidelines to avoid these common pitfalls.
