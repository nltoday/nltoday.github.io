India's income tax system has evolved over the years to accommodate growing complexity of the economy and changes in tax policies. While the goals remain the same - efficient collection of revenues and compliance, certain intricacies in deadlines and filing options need attention. This article provides a comprehensive overview of key due dates and options available for individuals filing their Income Tax Returns (ITR) for Assessment Year 2023-2024 in India.
### Missed the Deadline? Understanding Belated Returns  
For those who missed the original deadline of July 31, 2023 for non-audit cases or October 31, 2023 for audit cases, filing a [belated return](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-christmas-lights-funny-xmas-dog-lover-104-chihuahua-dog) under section 139(4) of the Income Tax Act provides protection from adverse actions. The due date for belated returns for AY 2023-2024 is **December 31, 2023**. Belated returns attract a late fee under section 234F, ranging from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 5,000 depending on the **total gross income**. No penalty applies if gross income is below Rs. 2.5 lakh. While belated returns allow filing post deadline, one must pay penalties to avoid further consequences of missed deadline.

### Updated Returns: A Second Chance till 2026
Introduced in 2022, the provision for filing **updated returns** under section 139(8A) within 24 months of the end of the relevant assessment year provides more breathing room for taxpayers. For AY 2023-2024, updated returns can be filed till **March 31, 2026**. However, an additional tax of 25% or 50% of the tax difference is applicable depending on when the updated return is furnished. Unlike belated returns, updated returns have certain restrictions like not allowing claiming refunds or showing lower income. They must have a clear reason for correction.
### Key Aspects of Filing Belated versus Updated Returns  
While both belated and updated returns have certain penalties, there are important differences. Belated returns aim to protect taxpayers who entirely missed the deadline, while updated returns serve correcting omissions within 2 years without prosecution risks. Updated returns levy higher additional taxes but allow longer window compared to belated returns. It is crucial to understand applicable limits before opting for either. **Notably, updated returns do not facilitate refund claims, so belated returns become only option if refunds are pending**.
### ITR Processing Delays for AY 2023-2024 
The processing of ITRs for AY 2023-2024 has seen some delays owing to multiple factors. Firstly, the tax department is implementing changes in the new ITR forms introduced in April 2023. Secondly, workload has increased amid the pandemic with backlogs yet to be cleared. Further, ongoing system upgrades are also impacting turnaround times. While the department works to reduce delays, taxpayers need to stay patient and regularly check status online. 
### Key Points to Ensure Fast Processing
To aid swift processing, taxpayers must **submit error-free returns**. Correcting errors leads to delays. Regularly tracking status using the online portal helps monitor progress without follow-ups. Most importantly, following due dates and filing requirements meticulously as per income slabs and audit rules provides a smoother filing experience.
### Conclusion
Overall, strict adherence to the applicable deadlines and choice of filing options like belated versus updated returns has tax implications. With evolving compliances, maintaining updated knowledge is crucial. Planning returns basis income trends helps make informed choices and ensure on-time compliant filing.
