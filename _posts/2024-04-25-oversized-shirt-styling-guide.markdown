### Layer It Up
Oversized shirts are meant to be layered for a casual yet stylish look. Pair your oversized button-up or flannel shirt with a fitted **t-shirt, tank top, or camisole** underneath. This allows you to achieve visual interest with texture and color contrast between the loose outer layer and form-fitting inner layer. You can leave some or all buttons undone to peek through the layers for a laidback vibe.

### Cinch It In 
If your oversized shirt hangs too low, there are a few tricks to define your waist. One option is to knot the front of the shirt on one or both sides. Make loose [knots above your hip bones](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-xmas-light-gift-for-chihuahua-lover-dog-lover-gift-idea4424-t-shirt) to reduce extra length without looking too structured. Another technique is to tuck the front portion into your pants or skirt while leaving the back untucked for a relaxed silhouette.
### Belt It Up
No matter how you style your oversized top, consider adding a **woven leather belt** approximately 1-2 inches below your natural waist. The belt draws attention to your midsection to balance your proportions. It also adds an on-trend accessory to finish your casual outfit. Go for a wide or thin belt depending on the design and fabric of your shirt.
### Pair with Form-Fitting Bottoms
To offset the loose fit up top, pair your oversized shirt with **skinny jeans, leggings, or fitted shorts**. These figure-hugging bottoms anchor the outfit and create a flattering **A-line** shape. Dark-washed skinny jeans in particular look polished when paired with a loose button-down or slouchy tee. 
### Layer On Accessories 
Extra details like jewelry, a hat, scarf, or sunglasses pull your casual look together. Opt for **bold statement necklaces, layered chains, oversized hoop earrings,** or a wide-brimmed hat in a complementary color. Accessories allow you to showcase your **personal style** while elevating a simple shirt-and-jeans combination. 
### Experiment with Fabrics and Prints
There is no single way to wear an oversized shirt. Part of the appeal is finding your favorite **denim, chambray, corduroy,** patterned, or solid options. Try sweatshirt-like knits, woven cotton poplins, or chunky knits depending on the season. You can also start with basics in solid colors then branch out to floral, **plaid prints,** or subtle patterns which break up an oversized silhouette. Always consider the fabric drape, weight, and texture when building your outfit.
### Stay Comfortable and Confident  
Above all, the oversized shirt trend is meant to feel laidback while still looking put together. Focus on finding **flowy silhouettes** in fabrics you love that allow freedom of movement. Accessorize in a way that reflects your personal style. With some strategic styling basics like layering, cinching, or pairing with form-fitting bottoms, you'll stay comfortable rocking this easygoing fashion.
