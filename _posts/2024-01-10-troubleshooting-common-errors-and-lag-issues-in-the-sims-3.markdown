### Optimizing Memory Usage
One of the most common errors players experience is [Error Code 12](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-funny-saint-bernard-lover-graphic-women-girls-st-bernard-1) or **Error Code 16**, which indicate that the computer no longer has enough **RAM (random access memory)** to properly save the game. When this occurs, it's usually because other programs are using RAM alongside the game. Closing unnecessary background programs can help free up needed memory for saving. Another option is to switch between active families in the neighborhood to reduce the amount of information that needs saving.

### Using Mods to Improve Performance 
A useful **mod called NRaas Overwatch** can help reduce the frequency of memory error codes popping up. While it can't be added to a running game, installing it in the mods folder allows it to scan the neighborhood each in-game day. This **deletes unused data** like stereos left on unattended lots, resets frozen Sims, deletes vehicles left on community lots, and more. It significantly speeds up gameplay.
### Managing Game and Neighborhood Size
If the save file exceeds 4GB in size, **Error Code 16** will occur due to file size limits. To reduce file size, use minimal textures on lots, reduce the number of lots, or move households to a new neighborhood using either expansion packs or copying to the bin. Regularly backing up saves and limiting custom content also prevents excessive file bloating over time.
### Purging Cache Files
Before each play session, it's wise to clear cache files that accumulate in the game folders. Certain files like featured items and world caches can be fully deleted without issues each time. Other files like thumbnails may cause a brief regeneration lag but help optimize loading in the long run. Clearing cache regularly keeps excess file buildup from impacting performance.
### Optimizing Custom Content
Scanning all custom content (CC) with tools like Custard or Delphy's Dashboard checks for corrupt files that could crash the game. Merging CC into larger packages rather than many small ones also improves load times. Removing unneeded package files from the downloads tab and using mods to limit stray animals further streamline content loading. 
### Additional Performance Tweaks
Capping the frame rate to 60fps with vsync prevents the CPU from wasting effort on unnecessary rendering. Periodically using a save cleaner like Kuree's finds unnecessary data bloating saves. Turning off in-game features like memories and lessons that are performance hogs but not critical to gameplay optimization provides a noticeable speed boost. Using debugging mods to fix issues found in error logs helps troubleshoot specific problems impacting individual saves as well. With some simple tweaks, Sims 3 can run smoothly for years of gameplay.
### Restoring Corrupt Saves 
Even with precautions, save corruption can still occur due to various factors over long play sessions. Fortunately, there is usually a fix. Navigate to the save files, find and delete the corrupted main save, then rename the auto-generated backup file to match the deleted one. Some progress may be lost since backups stop recording after corruption begins, but it allows gameplay to continue on the cleaned save. With regular optimization techniques, corruption incidents can become rare over time as well.
### Maximizing Hardware Resources 
Being a 32-bit program from 2009 means The Sims 3 is limited to using 4GB or less of system RAM even on computers with more available today. If memory issues persist after optimizing content and cache, it could indicate the game is overtaxing available RAM. In these situations, reducing neighborhood lots, household item count, and script mods may be necessary to avoid instability. Maintaining a regularly updated computer also ensures hardware resources are being fully utilized to support the game. With some tweaks, Sims 3 can still provide many more hours of fun, even on modern systems.
### Contacting Customer Support As A Last Resort
While optimization techniques resolve most common performance and technical problems, some complex issues may require assistance from The Sims customer support team. They have extensive diagnostic tools not available to players. Only contact support if basic troubleshooting fails to identify the cause of critical crashes or bugs preventing normal gameplay. Their representatives can further analyze exception logs and saved game data to pinpoint atypical problems. With patience and the community's collective optimization knowledge, virtually any Sims 3 neighborhood or save can be restored to smooth functioning for years to come.
