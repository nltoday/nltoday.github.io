Living with a serious liver disease was a wake-up call to change my lifestyle. After a hospital stay, my doctor advised me to quit unhealthy habits and take charge of my health. Though the road to transformation wasn't easy, committing to a plan and staying determined led to amazing results. Here is my story of starting slow, making gradual changes, and finding sustained motivation.
### Quitting Bad Habits and Making a Promise
When I was discharged from the hospital at 31 years old, my doctor sat down with me and asked how I was feeling. Though I said I was better, the experience of being hospitalized was something I never wanted to go through again. My doctor knew this and told me the only way to avoid returning was to [quit alcohol and unhealthy eating patterns](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-dog-lover-design-for-dogs-ownerand-puppy-lover4960-t-shirt) while adopting a healthier lifestyle. In that moment, I promised him I would change. Leaving the hospital, I was ready to overhaul bad habits that had led to my illness.

### Starting a Journey to Health at the Gym
After a month of recovery, I was cleared to begin exercising. I decided the gym would be a big part of my new routine. In the first weeks, I focused on basic cardio like walking on the treadmill. Pushing myself gently was important so I didn't get discouraged. Within a few months, I added strength training and varied my cardio, like alternating jogging days with swimming. Having a structured plan of alternating days helped ensure consistency. Tracking calories and macros also helped optimize workouts for **weight loss and muscle gain**.
### A Clean Diet Plan and Tracking Progress  
At the same time, I revamped my eating. Instead of junk food, I focused on balanced whole foods like lean proteins, fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, yogurt and eggs. Tracking intake with an app kept me accountable and showed progress. Gradually, I cut back on carbohydrates and refined sugar. Within 6 months, I dropped from 110kg to 75kg just by making small, sustainable swaps each week. Tracking not only calories but also macros kept me on track to efficiently lose weight while maintaining muscle.
### Facing Criticism and Staying Motivated 
Changing my lifestyle radically drew **judgment and teasing from others**. Some people try to bring you down when they see you improving yourself. However, I ignored negativity and focused on how great I felt making progress. Having "before" photos on my phone also kept me motivated on tough days. I came to realize losing weight improves more than just physical health - it enhances confidence and self-esteem. Staying determined through challenges and celebrating non-scale victories kept the momentum going.
### Maintaining Transformation Through Consistency
After the first year of intensive changes, I had to focus on maintaining results through consistency. Now, five years later, I weigh around 73kg while keeping muscle with strength training 4-5 times weekly. I still track intake to ensure balanced macros and a slight calorie deficit when needed. Enjoying exercise more, I mix up my routines to keep workouts engaging. Taking "after" photos annually traces ongoing progress. With a lifestyle now engrained as habit, I feel empowered maintaining this for life.
Overall, starting slow allowed sustainable changes. Gradual tweaks led to dramatic yet long-lasting results by prioritizing consistency over quick fixes. My health transformation proves with commitment and perseverance, anyone can turn their lives around.
