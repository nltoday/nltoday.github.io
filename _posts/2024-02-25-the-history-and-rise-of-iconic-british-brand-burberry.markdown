### early beginnings
Burberry was founded in 1856 in London, England by Thomas Burberry. In the early years, Burberry primarily focused on creating durable and functional outerwear for outdoor activities. It was during this time that Burberry developed its iconic "gabardine" fabric, known for its water-resistant yet breathable qualities. This innovation helped cement Burberry's reputation for producing high-quality and practical luxury fashion.

### pioneering new materials
As Burberry's fabrics became increasingly sophisticated, the company's popularity grew both in Britain and abroad. In the late 19th century, Burberry introduced its now-iconic checked pattern, known as the "Burberry check", which adorned many of its trench coats and accessories.The trademark check pattern, along with the Knight Equestrian logo, came to symbolize Burberry's core values of tradition, durability and British heritage. By the early 20th century, [luxury winter outerwear brand](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cowboy-howdy-horse-rider-western-cool-v-neck-t-shirt/men&) had stores across Europe.
### expanding globally 
Seeing opportunity for growth outside of Europe, Burberry opened stores in the United States starting in the 1980s. The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the British pound at the time made Burberry merchandise very attractively priced for international tourists. Burberry established flagship stores and partnerships with major U.S. department stores, cementing its popularity amongst affluent American consumers. However, Burberry's over-reliance on the wholesale model with department stores left it vulnerable to markdowns and fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
### adapting to new challenges
By the late 1990s, Burberry's iconic trench coats and accessories had become ubiquitous, worn by celebrities and mass-market brands alike. This threatened to diminish Burberry's luxury image. Under new leadership, Burberry refocused on craftsmanship and exclusivity. It strictly regulated the use of its trademarks to protectbrand equity. Burberry also centralized design and production, allowing for greater quality control. These strategic changes helped elevate Burberry once more amongst the ranks of premium luxury brands like **luxury fashion house** and Prada. 
### embracing digital innovation
In recent years, Burberry has leveraged digital platforms to further engage luxury customers worldwide. The brand utilizes innovative AR technologies, interactive online stores, runway livestreams and social media to provide immersive brand experiences. Burberry also collaborates with established designers to inject new creativity into classic designs. Notable collaborations include those with young British artists like Grimes. These initiatives have reinforced Burberry's position at the forefront of the lucrative global luxury market amongst younger luxury consumers.
### future of the iconic brand
Today, Burberry operates over 500 stores globally and maintains its British heritage as a hallmark of quality and tradition. Its trench coats, scarves and accessories remain top luxury gifts throughout the world. Looking ahead, Burberry will continue diversifying product lines while protecting its brand equity rigorously. Ongoing adoption of cutting-edge technologies also ensures the brand stays intimately engaged with its global affluent customer base. With a rich history of over 160 years of innovation, Burberry is poised to thrive as a iconic British luxury powerhouse for generations to come.
