### Collecting Your Digital Games
With over 2,000 digital games in their Steam library, one user expresses concern about how they would access all those games if Steam suddenly closed its doors. As [digital game download platform](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-santa-christmas-tree-lights-funny-xmas-pajama-boys-426-chihuahua-dog) like Steam hold the keys to gamers' purchased games libraries, the possibility of no longer being able to install and play those games is a real worry.

### Relying on Good Faith of Game Companies 
Steam's standard response is that in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, they would patch their platform to ensure users can still access and play their already purchased games. However, this user raises valid questions about how that would actually work in practice, considering most people only have a fraction of the games in their extensive libraries installed at any given time. Game companies would have to work diligently to **transition game libraries** in a way that satisfies gamers' reasonable expectations of continuing access.
### Taking Matters into One's Own Hands 
This Steam user is very clear that if their access to the games in their library was suddenly denied due to a platform shutdown, they would consider **digitally copying purchased games** through piracy means, as they see the games as rightfully theirs since purchase. While piracy is against the law and service agreements, the sentiment indicates consumers want assurances their digital game collections are truly owned by them and under their long-term control, not the control of any third party platform or company. 
### Carefully Curating a Core Collection
When speculating on which 10 games they would want to have continued access to even in a shutdown scenario, this user demonstrates putting thoughtful consideration into selecting titles that offer both **solo and multiplayer fun**, represent different genres for variety, and have proven longevity and replay value. Their list emphasizes games that can provide entertainment for an extended period of time. 
### Expanding Horizons Yet Sticking to Favorites
While some selections correspond to long-time personal favorites in franchises like Elder Scrolls, Civilization and Fallout, this gamer's list also shows a willingness to branch out and sample different experience types from city-builders and battle royale, to unique indie concepts. Factorio in particular demonstrates an interest in discovering **standalone games with great replayability**. At the same time, familiarity with beloved series is also important for sustained gaming engagement in times of uncertainty.
### Advocating for Digital Game Ownership 
Platform shutdown fear highlights the need for stronger digital property rights that respect gamers' ownership of their purchased library. While piracy should not be condoned, consumers must have legally supported options to archive and transfer their collections if necessary. Overall this discussion underlines how **game preservation and accessibility** post-purchase are concerns as reliance on singular third party storefronts grows. Gamers desire long-term control and continued access to the games that bring them joy.
