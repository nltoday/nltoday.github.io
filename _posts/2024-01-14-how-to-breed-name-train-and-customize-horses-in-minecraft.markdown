### Finding and Taming Wild Horses
Horses can be found roaming freely in plains biomes. To tame a wild horse, you must first approach it slowly while holding an empty hand. Right-click on the horse to mount it, which will likely cause it to buck you off quickly at first. Keep repeatedly mounting and riding the horse until hearts appear above its head, indicating that it is now tamed. [Feeding the horse apples](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-working-out-funny-chihuahua-fitness-gym-installing-muscles-illustrations5187-t-shirt) makes the taming process easier, as apples can be obtained by breaking oak leaves with your hands.

### Breeding Horses to Grow Your Herd
Once you have two tamed horses, you can breed them to produce foals. Simply feed both horses until hearts appear above their heads, and a baby horse will spawn nearby after a few seconds. Be sure to have enough **open space nearby** for the foal, or it could get trapped. If a horse and donkey are bred, the offspring will be a mule. Mules can carry chests but not be ridden.
### Training Horses with Saddles and Reins
A saddle is required for riding any tamed horse. Saddles can rarely be found in chest loot in structures like dungeons and nether fortresses. After obtaining a saddle, access the horse's inventory by right-clicking it while riding. Drag the saddle to the saddle slot to equip it. With a saddle equipped, the horse can now be freely steered with WASD keys. To lead a horse around on foot, craft reins using spider string and slimeballs. Right-click an equipped rein on a tamed horse to attach it and walk the horse wherever needed.
### Customizing Horses with Armor and Names
Just like players, horses can wear protective armor crafted from leather, iron, gold or diamond. Access the horse's inventory and drag armor pieces to the armor slot. Horses can also be given identifying names with name tags found in the same structure chests as saddles. Anvils allow engraving names onto blank name tags. Simply right-click a named tag on a horse to permanently name it. Both armor and names add a **personal touch** to differentiate owned horses in a herd.
### Using Chested Mules and Donkeys for Transport 
While horses provide speedy transport, mules and donkeys can serve as pack animals instead. Only these animals allow placement of a craftable chest directly onto their undersides by right-clicking while they are saddled. The chest then functions as normal inventory storage that is **mobile with the animal**. Simply access the chest by right-clicking again to safely transport hauled goods across the land.
### Conclusion
With the right tools and training, horses can become **valuable steeds** in Minecraft for **exploration, hauling and combat**. Take the time to grow your herd, equip them properly, and personalize through naming to form strong bonds with your trusted equine companions on journeys across the diverse open worlds.
