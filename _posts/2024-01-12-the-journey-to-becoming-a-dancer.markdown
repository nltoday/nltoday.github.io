Ever since I was young, I have always been drawn to dance and movement. However, it was not until college that I really discovered my passion and began my journey to become a dancer. Here is my story.
### Discovering My Inspiration
When I was in middle school, a friend showed me a video of legendary dancer [Michael Jackson](https://yt.io.vn/collection/adolph) performing his iconic song "**Billie Jean**". I was mesmerized by his smooth moves and enjoyed the catchy beat. However, at that time I did not have access to learn more about dance. It was not until years later in college that I came across that same song and felt inspired to learn more. I spent hours watching **Michael Jackson**'s live performances of "**Billie Jean**" on repeat, studying his legendary **moonwalk** and other moves. This ignited a fire in me to start practicing dance seriously.

### My First Steps
With **Michael Jackson** as my inspiration, I began practicing the choreography to "**Billie Jean**" in my dorm room. At first, it was a struggle and I felt clumsy trying to mimic the dances. My roommates would laugh at my attempts. But I remained determined and kept practicing every day for months. Slowly but surely, I started to get better at replicating the moves. My friend noticed my progress and encouraged me to audition for the dance team at my university. With their support and guidance, I was able to improve tremendously over the course of my freshman year.
### Joining the Dance Team  
By the time freshman year ended, I had come a long way in my dance skills thanks to dedicated practice and lessons from the dance team coaches. I was excited to take on a bigger role in my sophomore year. I decided to audition again, this time aiming for a leadership position. Through months of rehearsals and performances, I gained even more experience performing complex choreographies in front of audiences. By my junior year, I was selected as the captain of the dance team. Leading my peers and producing show-stopping routines gave me so much confidence in my abilities.
### Expanding My Horizons
Being on the university dance team opened many doors for me. I was exposed to different styles of dance, from hip hop to jazz to ballet. I realized I had a strong foundation in multiple genres, not just what initially drew me in—pop and hip hop. To challenge myself further, I started taking advanced dance classes in various styles during summers and school breaks. I also began regularly attending dance conferences and workshops across the country. Here, I learned from renowned choreographers and dancers. Interacting with the broader dance community fueled my passion and kept me learning.
### Pursuing Professional Opportunities
All the training and experiences throughout college prepared me to take my dance career to the next level. After graduating with a BFA in Dance, I decided to move to Los Angeles to pursue job opportunities in the entertainment industry. I worked hard to build my resume, dancing backup for musicians on tours and in music videos. After a few years of networking, I landed my biggest break yet—a spot dancing on a popular TV show. Being on such a large production allowed me to showcase my skills to an even wider audience. This success gave me the confidence to start chasing my dream of choreographing for major artists.
### Passing It Forward 
Now that I have found success as a professional dancer and choreographer in Los Angeles, I want to give back to the next generation. I began teaching hip hop, jazz, and contemporary dance classes at a local studio near my home. Working with enthusiastic young students reminds me of when I first fell in love with dance. It is rewarding to see them progress and develop their own unique styles. I also volunteer my time leading dance workshops in underserved communities. My goal is to inspire others the way legends like **Michael Jackson** inspired me. I hope that through dance, I can empower more youth to chase their dreams.
### Still Learning
Even after over a decade in the professional dance world, I am always looking for ways to improve and challenge myself. These days, when I am not in the studio working on new projects, you can find me taking classes from some of the best instructors in the field. I find that continuing to learn from peers keeps me fresh and innovative. Dance is an ever-evolving art form, so staying teachable is key to long-term success. Some genres like voguing have also piqued my interest lately, and I am having fun experimenting with newer styles. Who knows where this journey will take me next, but I am thankful for all the rich experiences so far. Dance will always be my passion.
