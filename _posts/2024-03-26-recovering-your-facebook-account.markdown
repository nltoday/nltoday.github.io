### Understanding Your Situation
The first step is to determine whether your Facebook account has been hacked or if it is simply locked. A locked account usually means you logged in from a new device or changed phones. This can typically be resolved by contacting Facebook support. 
However, if your account has been hacked, the password and email may have been changed, making it harder to prove ownership. In serious cases, the account could be completely disabled. It's important to understand the cause of the deactivation in order to choose the right recovery method.
