### Preparation is Key
Proper preparation is so important when flying with a baby. Pack more than enough diapers, wipes, diaper cream and changes of clothing for leaks or blowouts. Bring plenty of familiar food pouches, baby food containers, formula, bottles and snacks. Babies do best sticking to their usual eating schedule so it's important to have enough food on hand. Don't forget snacks and drinks for yourself as well - you'll need your strength!

### Entertainment is Crucial  
Babies get bored easily so it's crucial to bring a good variety of age-appropriate **toys, books, and electronic devices** to keep them occupied during take-offs, landings and long delays. Open-ended toys that make sounds or have different textures like rattles, blocks or shape sorters tend to hold little ones' interest longer than toys with a single function. Consider bringing an **iPad loaded with toddler TV shows, music videos and educational apps** for longer flights.
### Safety First on Board
Once on the flight, establish a comfortable, safe space for baby. An **FAA-approved car seat** provides optimal protection if bassinets aren't available. Bring your own change pad so diaper changes don't happen directly on the aircraft seats or tables for sanitary reasons. Take baby out of their seat and give them a short walk up and down the aisle every hour to get wiggles out and help adjust ears and stomach. 
### Manage Pressure Changes 
Feed or give baby a **soothing pacifier before take-offs and landings** when ears tend to pop. This helps baby swallow and equalizes pressure changes. For older babies who can drink from a **sippy cup, offer water or breast milk** during these times. Playing calming music or guided relaxation videos on a mobile device during ascent and descent can also help soothe an upset tummy or ears.
### Enlist Help from Others  
Long flights are exhausting with a baby in tow. Don't be shy about briefly handing baby off to a nice co-passenger if needed so you can use the restroom, eat a meal or rest for just a few minutes. Most travelers are sympathetic. Give cabin crew a heads up so they can help in an emergency. Bonus points for packing small **travel-sized candies or earplugs** to apologize for any noise with a cute note explaining the situation. People are usually very kind about babies on planes.
### Choose Flight Times Wisely
If possible, consider your baby's sleep patterns and schedule flights during natural nap or bedtimes. Babies usually rest better at night so red-eye flights can be easier than day flights if they fall asleep quickly in new places. If flying during daytime hours, be sure to have extra entertainment and snacks on hand in case of fussiness from stimulation, discomfort or boredom with limited movement. Flexibility is key when flying with little ones.
### Seek Support at the Airport  
Airport chaos with screaming baby in tow can feel impossible. If possible, have someone with you right up until gate to provide an extra set of hands while navigating security with stroller and carry-ons. Baby carriers or slings free hands up for tasks. Bring empty water or milk bottles through security since formula or breast milk may be confiscated as liquids. Let security know you're travelling with an infant so they can help expedite screening if needed.
