### Becoming a Global Phenomenon
When Pokémon first launched in 1996 as a video game for the Game Boy, nobody could have predicted the massive cultural impact it would have around the world.

It quickly grew into a merchandising powerhouse spanning anime, movies, trading cards and more. Chief among these extensions was the Pokémon anime series produced by animation studio OLM.

Following Ash on his journey to become a Pokémon Master, the early seasons were praised for their spirit of discovery, friendship and fun battle scenarios. Within a few years, Pokémon became a global phenomenon uniting children of the 90s and early 2000s in their shared experience.
