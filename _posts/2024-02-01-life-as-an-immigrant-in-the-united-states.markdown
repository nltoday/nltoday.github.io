## Cultural Diversity and the Melting Pot Experience
### An International Workplace  
I was surprised to see **90% of my office team immigrated** from some country. **Rest of the 10% are born in the USA** but their forefathers immigrated to the United States. My Russian colleagues cracks jokes during office meetings in their Russian slang. My American Manager whose grand parents immigrated from UK is very hilarious.

### A Global Food Scene
I buy delicious donuts from a local donut shop which is managed by a Cambodian. I usually have lunch at Cafeteria with my Indian friends sharing their delicious food. We go to a Korean store (Lotte Plaza) for buying Indian groceries. 
### Immigrant-Owned Businesses 
I usually fill gas in a gas station owned by an Indian Punjabi. I go to a car maintenance/repair shop managed by a Pakistani.
## Community Through Diversity
### An International Social Circle
My running group has people from Canada, Germany and China. I meditate with people from Nepal, Thailand, Bhutan and Myanmar. I usually have a good conversation with cab drivers who are from either from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Afghanistan or Pakistan.
### Immigrant Healthcare Providers
I go to my physician for a physical checkup who immigrated from Philippines. My wife goes to a 'Telugu' speaking Indian doctor for regular checkups. My kids go to a pediatrician who is an immigrant from Iraq.  
### Cultural Exposure Through Family Activities
My daughter learns Spanish from a teacher who migrated from Spain. My daughter has a 'International night' at her school where different cultures (American, Indian, Vietnamese, Korean, Hispanic, Ethiopian) perform.
## A Diverse Retail Experience
### Shopping in Multi-Ethnic Spaces
I interact with Walmart/Costco store cashiers who migrated from South America, Middle East and Asia. We eat out every Sunday at different restaurants - American, Mexican, Italian, Chinese, Thai, Japanese, Greek, Mediterranean, Indian or Pakistani. We go to shopping at a mall and meet all kinds of nationalities. 
### Immigrant-Owned Services  
My wife takes domestic help from a lady immigrated from Mexico. My wife goes to a dry cleaner shop sometimes which is run by a Korean. My wife goes to a nail salon shop sometimes which is managed by a Vietnamese. 
### Experiencing Different Cultures
We went to a remote place for a vacation and stayed in a motel owned by Indian Gujarati family. I and my son go to a barber shop managed by a Jamaican. My son learns badminton from a coach immigrated from Iran. My daughter learns Indian classical dance from an Indian immigrant.
## A Land of Opportunity for Immigrants
### Contributions of Native and Immigrant Communities
Interestingly, these are very common at every metro city area, either at DC or at Bay Area. But I never got a chance to meet any native Americans so far. So I wondered where do they live? I finally found some of them at 'American Indian Museum' at DC.
### The United States as a Melting Pot
American life is truly a melting pot of different cultures. People from all over the world immigrate to the United States in search of new opportunities and a better life. Through hard work and community, both immigrants and native-born Americans alike shape the diverse cultural fabric of this nation.
