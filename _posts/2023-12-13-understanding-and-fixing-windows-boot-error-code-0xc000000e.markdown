### Corrupt Boot Configuration File 
Error code 0xc000000e indicates that [Windows boot configuration file](https://store.fi.io.vn/game-controller-christmas-for-video-gamers-boys-kids-455/women&) (**BCD**) is corrupt, missing or failed. BCD contains important boot information such as operating system path, boot loader settings etc. If BCD gets corrupted due to various reasons like virus infection, hardware/software issues, improper shutdown; then Windows will fail to boot and display this error.

### Checking Physical Connections
One simple way to troubleshoot is checking physical connections of internal and external drives. The corrupted BCD could be due to improperly connected drives having higher boot priority. Disconnect all external drives, check SATA cables of internal drives and reboot. If PC boots normally, issue was with external drive connection overriding BCD settings. 
### Rebuilding BCD Using Command Prompt
If disconnecting external drives doesn't help, next step is to rebuild BCD using Command Prompt. Boot your system from Windows installation media into recovery environment. Go to Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Command Prompt. Run 'bootrec /rebuildbcd' command which will scan system and build a new boot configuration file. This often fixes boot issues caused due to corrupted BCD.
### Using Windows Startup Repair Utility
Another built-in Windows tool to fix boot problems is Startup Repair. Boot into Windows RE and select 'Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Repair'. It diagnoses startup issues and repairs them automatically if possible without user intervention. Startup Repair is useful in fixing boot errors by fixing system files, registry settings etc.
### Enabling UEFI/WHQL Support in BIOS
Some motherboards require enabling UEFI/Windows Hardware Quality Labs (**WHQL**) support in BIOS to boot recent Windows versions. Navigate to BIOS and look for these options, enable them if available. Enabling UEFI/WHQL support ensures computer firmware and hardware drivers are WHQL certified for smooth booting of Windows.
### Resetting BIOS/UEFI Settings 
If the issue persists even after above fixes, try resetting BIOS/UEFI settings to factory defaults. Some corrupt BIOS settings may cause boot failures. Access BIOS setup, load optimized defaults/reset to setup defaults and reboot. Doing so restores motherboard to its original settings which may solve boot issues.
### Marking Drive as Online 
It's also possible that drive containing Windows is marked 'Offline' unintentionally. To resolve it, boot using Windows installation media, access Command Prompt from recovery options and run 'diskpart' command. Check drive status using 'list disk/volume' command, select problematic drive/volume and mark it as 'online' using 'online disk/volume' command followed by exit.
### Reinstalling Windows as Last Resort
If nothing helps, the last option would be to reinstall Windows to get a fresh installation. Before reinstalling - backup personal files using **MiniTool Power Data Recovery** bootable media. Wipe disk completely using diskpart clean command and reinstall Windows. A clean installation resolves most boot issues caused due to system file corruption.
### Diagnosing Hardware Issues Using External Monitor
Some hardware failures can trigger error 0xc000000e as well. To diagnose, connect an external monitor and reboot. If Windows boots on external screen, it indicates an issue with internal display. Try updating/reinstalling graphics drivers as well. If external monitor also doesn't work, it may require component level diagnosis and repair/replacement.
### Fixing Screen Issues on Dell Laptops 
Dell laptop users often face this error due to screen faults. Try these steps - Hold D and power button, check for multi-colored screen. If yes, it's OS issue. No colors means bad LCD. Connect external monitor, check if it's detected and boots - it isolates display issue. While booting, hold Fn and power, wait for color bars prompt and hit 'Y'.
### Using Reset BIOS Settings Keyboard Combination
A last hardware level troubleshooting is resetting BIOS using dedicated key combinations. For most systems, it's similar to press and hold D key during few boot cycles until different colors appear on screen before Windows starts loading. Resetting BIOS chip this way restores it to factory configurations and may help in getting past this error.
### Conclusion
In summary, error code 0xc000000e arises due to corruption or faults in boot process at software or hardware level. The article covers various fixes from simple ones like checking cables and BIOS settings to advanced techniques like rebuild BCD using Command Prompt, resetting BIOS and reinstalling Windows. Isolating issues properly helps applying right resolution.
