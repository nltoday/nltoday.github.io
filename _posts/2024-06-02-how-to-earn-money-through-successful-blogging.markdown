Content input:
Well, it all depends.
Blogging is about answer the questions about price, comparisons and potential problems with your audience
If done well with an appropriate Call To Action (CTA), then the answer could be quite a bit 
According to our internal tracking, our blog readers downloading a Buyers Guide CTA converted into 12.5 million dollars in a year
It is probably well North of that....Here is what you need to do
1. Stop talking about yourself...nobody cares 
2. Identify the Best products in your category...people search using the term Best
3. Use long tail keywords...Like Best 30 inch Professional Gas Ranges (Reviews/Ratings/Prices)...Range is the main keyword, while 30 inch and professional talk to a specific audience
4. Ratings/Reviews...people search by those terms
5. NewJack (I coined that term)...Write about what is brand new. You will rank number 1 by default
6. Prices: Another highly searched term..everyone wants to know so answer even if it depends...Don’t be so naive to think your competitors don’t know your prices
7. Problems: Be honest about potential issues...this may also scare off the wrong customer. People will also appreciate the honesty
8. VS...brands talk about themselves and never compare about with their peers.....you can do that and have a much more qualified lead...Bosch Vs KitchenAid dishwashers for example or Viking Vs Sub-Zero
9. Don’t write crap....although you will at first, answwer completely and edit your work
10. Have the authority...know what the heck you are talking about..people can see through crap
11. Have a tangible CTA for next steps
12. Publish 2–5 times a week
I could go into titling, metatagging, etc......But its hard to do consistently and incredibly rewarding if executed properly
Good Luck
Your earnings will depend on three factors. 
1. Your niche.
2. How you choose to monetize.  
3. How much traffic you get and, on a related note, where your traffic comes from.
Let’s break this down.
#1: What niche are you targeting?
Please understand that different topics on the internet pay differently. 
You can be excited about a music topic, but the only payment that you're going to get, really, is your passion because you're not going to make much money with your blog.
On the other hand, if you talk about insurance, legal-type topics, or specialized types of software, you can make quite a bit of cash just through ad clicks.
Niche matters, so you have to pick the right niche or target your niche based on the income you want to earn.
Otherwise, you're basically just going to struggle for a long time with your blog.
#2: You have to monetize your blog
You can't just pick out AdSense—or any other pay-per-click program—and expect to become rich. It doesn't work that way. 
Even if you have a very lucrative niche, you can still make way more money creating your own products or generating leads for customers that directly partner with you.
The further away you get from “automatic ads,” the more money you stand to earn.
Of course, this is all dependent on the volume and quality of your traffic.
Which brings me to....
#3: You have to get traffic.
Now, the good news is, depending on your niche, you can still make a lot of money with relatively little traffic.
But you still have to get traffic.
Also, the traffic has to come from the right places.
I mean, I hate to say this, but if your traffic mostly comes from outside the United States and you're relying on ad clicks to make money, you're not going to make as much as you hope.
That's just the plain reality.
So, the key is to target American, UK, and Canadian traffic. That's where the money is.
But, you have to get a decent amount of traffic.
Here’s a secret that a lot of bloggers don't want to share: to get traffic, you don't have to necessarily focus on the hardest keywords because if you did that, you're going to face a lot of competition. 
The better approach would be to put your keywords into Google and find questions that Google suggests that you search for.
Load those questions. See if other people are answering them correctly.
If there is no comprehensive answer or most of the answers are from forums—or even Quora—that’s a golden opportunity.
Write down that question, and produce at least a 1,000-word post answering that question.
If you do this, Google will send you traffic for all the questions that you nailed. This is crucial!
Even though each question can, maybe, only pull in 30-50 people per month, if you have hundreds of these types of pages, you have decent traffic.
I use a paid SEO tool to find these keywords and questions quickly
And, the most important part is that it is targeted traffic.
Now, you may be asking yourself, “How do I produce all that content? And we’re talking about hundreds of thousands of words in a short period of time!”
Well, there are two ways to do it. 
To help get all the burden off your back, you can find experienced native English speaker writers like Andy Peterson, David Reese, and Gene Eugenio.
These are professional writers who are all known for producing solid work or owning agencies that deliver great materials.
Another option is to hire a bulk writing service contractor from platforms like Upwork, Bulxter, or Fiverr.
Of course, these options will require a bit of investment on your part.
Especially if you're paying for quality, you're going to have to spend a bit of money on these authors and services.
The second option—and the one I personally prefer—is using a technique called dictaphone writing or dictablogging.
Using this method, you can produce a blog post by just improvising on a short outline that will serve to help you remember your knowledge and research on any given topic.
This will help you produce much more in a shorter period of time.
Especially if you’ve grown used to this technique, you can finish up to 25,000 words per day—and this is not some wild estimate! Most people speak at a rate of 200 words per minute, so this is very doable.
I suggest you check out resources like ProBlogger, Dictablogger, or HubSpot to learn more about this technique.
It gets easy with more practice, and with the help of free online resources, it would take you no time to master this method.
$170000 total money earned until now. I started blogging 1.5 years ago and i started earning in my 4th month of blogging. I mostly get my income through affliate marketing but ads also contribute. If you want to earn through blogging then you need to become a seller first. You should have such talking skills that anyone who reads your blog starts to trust you. I provide knowledge about blogging, seo, tech, gadgets and games. I have 2 blogs right now and both are successful. If you want to make money from blogging then go and buy a website now because competition in blogging is increasing day by day.
### Choosing the Right Niche
When starting a blog, one of the most important decisions is choosing the right niche to focus on. As mentioned earlier, different topics have different earning potentials. Here are a few things to consider when choosing a niche:
- **Commercial potential:** Topics related to business, finance, entrepreneurship, technology and health often have more earning opportunities through affiliate marketing, advertising, etc. compared to hobbies or passions. 
- **Audience size:** Pick a topic that has a large enough potential audience, but not too competitive. Check Google keyword planner to research audience size and competition for relevant keywords. 
- **Monetization options:** Look for niches that lend themselves well to revenue streams like sales of downloadable products, online courses, sponsored posts, etc. in addition to ads. 
- **Personal interest:** It's hard to publish frequently without passion. Pick a topic you genuinely find interesting to learn and write about over the long run. 
- **Community presence:** See if forums, groups, conventions already exist so your future audience is easier to find and engaged.

### Creating Valuable Content
Once the niche is selected, the focus should be on creating high-quality, insightful content that provides value to readers and search engines. Here are some tips:
- **Answer questions:** Find common queries using Google's autocomplete and write thorough, reader-focused posts answering them. 
- **Use long-tail keywords:** In addition to main keywords, target related long-tail keywords describing specific problems, products, audiences etc. 
- **Include helpful elements:** Ratings, comparisons, reviews, guides help readers make informed decisions and keep them engaged on the site for longer.
- **Publish regularly:** Consistency is important for search engines and building an audience. Aim for 2-3 high-quality posts per week initially. 
- **Optimize for readers and
