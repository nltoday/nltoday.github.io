This article discusses the basics of subject-verb agreement including the key rules and exceptions. By understanding subject-verb agreement, writers can improve their grammar and produce clearer, more polished writing.
### Key Concepts
Subject-verb agreement refers to matching the subject of a sentence with a verb that agrees in number - singular or plural. **A singular subject takes a singular verb while a plural subject takes a plural verb.** Some key things to check for agreement are:
- Subject nouns and their verbs must match in number.
- Compound subjects joined by "and" are usually plural and take a plural verb.
- Collective nouns like "group", "team" can be singular or plural depending on the context.
- Phrases beginning with "there is/are" use a singular verb with "there is" and plural verb with "there are".

### Common Pronouns as Subjects
Pronouns are another area where subject-verb agreement can get tricky. Some common pronoun subjects and their verb forms are:
- "I", "he", "she", "it" take a singular verb. Examples: "I am", "she jumps".  
- "We", "they", "you" are plural and take a plural verb. Examples: "They run", "You play".
- "Who" can be either singular or plural depending on if it refers to a single person or multiple people.
### Compound Subjects Joined by "And" 
As a general rule, compound subjects joined by "and" are considered plural subjects that require a plural verb. Some examples:
- "Sam and John [are](https://store.fi.io.vn/white-frenchie-french-bulldog-starry-night-van-gogh-colorful-2) going to the park."  
- "Ice cream **and** cookies **are** on the table."
However, there are exceptions when the subjects act as a single unit. In those cases, a singular verb is used:
- "**Rice and curry** **is** delicious."
- "Bread **and** butter **is** served."
### Collective Nouns 
Collective nouns like "group", "team", "number", "majority" can be either singular or plural depending on the intended meaning. If the group is seen as a single unit, the verb is singular. If individuals within the group are emphasized, the verb is plural:
- "The committee **is** working on a solution." (Singular)
- "The committee **are** discussing options." (Plural)
### Subject-Verb Agreement with "There is/are"
When using "there is/are" constructions, the verb agrees with the second noun phrase, not the word "there".
- "There **is** a cat on the porch."  
- "There **are** many cats on the porch."
### Exceptions to Agreement Rules
While the above covers many common subjects, there are exceptions that require special treatment regarding verb forms:
- Collective nouns like "number", "majority"
- Phrases with "each" and "every" 
- Subject-verb inversion structures
- Subjects joined by "either/or", "neither/nor"
Understanding these nuanced cases is important for producing grammatically correct writing.
### Agreement with Compound Verbs
Compound verbs containing helping verbs like "is", "are", "was", "were" also require agreement with the subject. For example:
- "She **is walking** to the store."
- "**They have been** running all day."
The main verb in a compound structure must agree with the subject, not just the helping verb. Getting this subtlety right avoids errors.
### When Subject-Verb Confusion Occurs
Mismatches between subject and verb most commonly occur when:
- The subject is far from the verb in the sentence.
- The subject is compound or contains inconsistent elements.  
- The number of the subject is unclear or ambiguous.
- Non-standard sentence structures are used like passive voice.
Being aware of situations where confusion can arise helps writers be more careful about agreement.
### Using Context Clues for Agreement
When in doubt about the number of an unfamiliar subject, context clues within the surrounding sentences can provide hints. Asking questions like:
- Is the subject referred to as "they", implying plural?  
- Is the subject performing an action that clearly indicates singular or plural?
Looking at broader context, rather than isolating just one sentence, can help decipher tricky cases.
### Avoiding Agreement Errors in Writing
To avoid subject-verb agreement mistakes that undermine clarity and professionalism, writers should:
- Read their writing out loud, listening for inconsistencies.
- Have a peer reviewer examine work with a fresh perspective.  
- Use grammar checking tools to flag potential errors.
- Study exception cases where confusion commonly occurs.
- Rely on context clues to discern number when unsure of an unfamiliar subject.
- Verify agreement with compound and collective nouns.
With practice and diligence, virtually all agreement issues can be eliminated from writing.
This covers the essential rules and common pitfalls of subject-verb agreement in English. Understanding these concepts leads to better grammar skills and communication through clear, polished writing.
### Agreement Challenges with Phrases like "Each" or "Every" 
Subject-verb agreement gets complicated when the subject of a sentence contains phrases like "each" or "every". As singular identifiers, they can create unique agreement issues.
For example:
- "Each of the students **is** studying for the exam."  
- "Every one of the cookies **has** chocolate chips."
While "students" and "cookies" are plural nouns, the use of "each" and "every" before them makes the subject a series of individual items. Therefore a singular verb is required.
However, if the noun is followed by a prepositional phrase, the verb is usually plural:
- "Each of the students **are** in their rooms."
- "Every one of the cookies **are** on the plate."  
The prepositional phrase "of the students/cookies" shifts the focus back to the plural nouns, triggering a plural verb.
With compound structures like these, writers must consider the entire subject phrase when selecting the correct verb form. Subtle distinctions are important to communicate precisely.
### Challenging Constructions: Passive Voice, Inversion  
More complex sentence structures pose unique agreement challenges. Two examples are passive voice and subject-verb inversion constructions.
In passive voice, where the subject is the recipient of the action, the verb is still controlled by the true subject:
- "The cake **was eaten** by the children." 
Here "children" performs the eating, but "cake" is the grammatical subject, so a singular verb is used. 
Subject-verb inversion flips the expected order. The verb still matches the subject:
- "Out of the house ran the dog."
- "**Were** shown the paintings?" 
Inversions require locating the actual subject, often coming after the inverted verb, to choose the right form. 
Sentences diverging from the basic subject-verb-object pattern introduce ambiguity. Writers must consider the entire construction to pinpoint the subject controlling the verb.
### Delicate Agreement with Collective Nouns 
As covered earlier, collective nouns denoting a group can be singular or plural based on intended meaning. This subtle distinction poses challenges.
For example:
- "The crowd **was** getting restless." (Singular unit)
- "The crowd **were** talking loudly." (Individuals within)
Other tricky collectives include "dozen", "majority", "minority", "number", "variety".
Context and focused meaning must indicate singular or plural interpretation.
When describing an entire class or category, collective nouns often require singular verbs:
- "Practice **makes** perfect."
- "Variety **is** the spice of life."
But discussing individuals within the collective calls for plural verbs: 
- "The team **are** deciding on a strategy."
- "Statistics **show** positive results."
Nuanced use of collective nouns challenges writers. Consider focused meaning and context carefully.
### Agreeing with Compound Subjects
Compound subjects joined by coordinating conjunctions like "and", "or", "nor" can be either singular or plural. Context and close reading are key.
When the elements are considered a single unit or thought, a singular verb follows:
- "Fish and chips **is** delicious."
- "Neither soup nor salad **is** available."
But if the elements are viewed separately, even if joined, a plural verb is required: 
- "My books and pencil **are** on the table."
- "Chocolate or vanilla **are** popular ice cream flavors."
With compounds, deciding whether the focus is singular or plural dictates the agreement. Ambiguity should be avoided for clarity.
This covers many complex subject-verb agreement situations that commonly cause errors and confusion. Thorough understanding leads to accurate, polished grammar in writing.
