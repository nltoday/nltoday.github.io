## Coping with Betrayal  
Coming clean about infidelity is difficult, but taking accountability for one's actions is the first step towards repairing the damage. While apologies cannot undo the past, they can plant seeds for a more honest future. 
### Understanding Her Perspective
Put yourself in her shoes - how would you feel if betrayed in the same way? She likely feels deep hurt, anger, rejection and a loss of self-worth. Accept that she may react emotionally without judgement. Give her space and time to process her emotions in a healthy way.

### Expressing Remorse and Regret
Clearly communicate your remorse for hurting her and regret over the choices you made. Explain what you regret and why, using "I" statements to take accountability. Assure her your betrayal says more about your weaknesses than her worth.
## Understanding Her Needs  
A betrayed partner needs both time and actions to believe promises of changed behavior. Listen empathetically to understand how betrayal impacted her sense of safety and self. Focus outwardly on her needs rather than inwardly on your own guilt or fear of losing the relationship.
