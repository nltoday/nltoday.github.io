Hardware implementation of complex mathematical functions like exponential, logarithm, trigonometric functions etc. is not a trivial task but is very important for applications like signal processing, control systems etc. In this article, we will deep dive into how such complex functions can be efficiently implemented in hardware using Verilog HDL by exploiting their power series expansion.
### Taylor Series Expansion
All [complex mathematical functions](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/alexandre) can be approximated very closely using their **Taylor series expansion**. The key idea is to write the function as an infinite sum of terms involving powers of the independent variable. For example, the Taylor series expansion of exponential function is given by:
**e^x = 1 + x + x^2/2! + x^3/3! + ...** 
Similarly, the Taylor series for trigonometric functions like sine and cosine are:
**sin(x) = x - x^3/3! + x^5/5! - ...**
**cos(x) = 1 - x^2/2! + x^4/4! - ...**
The beauty of Taylor series is that **it allows breaking down any complex function into simpler building blocks** like addition, multiplication and division that can be easily implemented in hardware using basic gates.

### Hardware Implementation Strategy
The general strategy to implement **Taylor series based complex functions in hardware using Verilog HDL** involves the following steps:
1. Write the Taylor series expansion of the desired function up to required number of terms depending on required accuracy.
2. Identify the basic building blocks like addition, multiplication, division etc. required to implement individual terms. 
3. Design basic hardware modules to perform operations like multiplication, division etc. 
4. Interconnect these modules appropriately using adders/multiplexers to generate the desired Taylor series sequence.
5. Accumulate the series terms using an adder to produce the final output.
Let's understand these steps in detail with an example of exponential function.
### Exponential Function Implementation
As per Taylor series, the first three terms of e^x expansion are:
**e^x = 1 + x + x^2/2**
The hardware architecture to implement this is:
1. The term 1 is hardwired. 
2. For term x, we require a multiplier with one input as x and other as 1. 
3. For term x^2/2, we require:
- A multiplier to calculate x^2.
- A right shift circuit to divide by 2.
4. Finally, an adder tree is used to sum all the terms.
The Verilog code for this architecture would involve modules for multiplier, right shifter and adder with appropriate port connections. This generates the exponential function up to the required accuracy level.
### Hardware Efficient Modular Design
To **reduce hardware resources**, the design can be made **modular** by creating a single **multiplier module** capable of performing multiplication, division and higher power operations by controlling the operands and shift amounts using addition control signals.
Also, to further **reduce area and delay**, the terms in Taylor series can be **reordered intelligently** based on non-zero exponent values so that common hardware blocks are shared between terms without affecting accuracy. 
Lastly, proper **pipelining and unrolled architectures** must be employed in Verilog code to achieve maximum **operating frequency**.
### Function Accuracy and Number of Terms
The accuracy of approximation to achieve maximum **operating frequency**.
### Function Accuracy and Number of Terms
The accuracy of approximation **increases with number of terms** in Taylor series. However, more terms require more hardware. Thus, a sweet spot needs to be chosen based on accuracy-area-speed tradeoff. 
Also, error correcting techniques like **CORDIC algorithm** can be combined with Taylor series to achieve higher accuracy with fewer terms by iteratively correcting the error at each step.
### Conclusion
In this article, we discussed how complex mathematical functions can be implemented efficiently in digital hardware using their Taylor series expansion. The key ideas of modular design, term reordering, pipelining etc. were explained along with a sample exponential function implementation. With Verilog HDL, such Taylor series based architectures can be designed, simulated and synthesized for FPGA/ASIC platforms.
