### Why We Procrastinate
We all procrastinate from time to time, putting off important tasks for less important ones. But for some, procrastination becomes a constant struggle that negatively impacts their lives and productivity. Understanding the root causes of procrastination is the first step to overcoming it. 
There are two parts of our brains that are always fighting for control - the rational, thinking part called Albert and the impulsive, emotional part called Rex. Rex is our survival instinct that keeps us safe by avoiding risks, changes and difficulties. However, in modern times, Rex's risk avoidance often manifests as procrastination.

Rex listens to Albert but will try to steer us towards short-term pleasures like snacking, social media or television if a task seems frustrating or overwhelming. With deadlines looming, Albert tries to take back control but the inner struggle often results in last-minute panic or task avoidance.

### Taking Stock of How You Spend Time
To overcome procrastination, the first step is gaining self-awareness about how time is really spent each day. For a month, carefully track all daily activities in a time-blocking journal or calendar in 15-30 minute intervals. 
This exercise reveals procrastination triggers like unscheduled breaks, distractions from notifications and habits like checking social media unintentionally. It also shows where time is being wasted so new routines can be implemented. Regular self-reflection helps sustain better time management habits over the long-term.

### Understanding How Habits Form  
Habits, whether good or bad, form through cues, routines, and rewards, according to habit formation research. A cue like wanting to relax triggers the procrastination routine of watching TV instead of working. This provides an immediate reward for Rex of relaxation and dopamine release, reinforcing the habit.
To break bad habits, the key is replacing the routine with one leading to better long-term rewards. For example, setting a timer for focused work, getting into a flow state, and then allowing a short relaxing break as the new routine. Understanding habit loops empowers replacing procrastination habits with productive ones.

### Controlling the Environment
Since habits and willpower can be overridden by cues in our environment, controlling surroundings is important for resisting procrastination. This involves decluttering physical and digital spaces of temptation triggers. 
Temptation barriers need to be installed like putting the TV in another room while working, or using website blockers to restrict distractions online. A separate work area away from home comforts also helps shift the mindset. Overall, environmental control makes it easier to sustain new productive habits over time.

### Setting Realistic Goals  
Unrealistic expectations set the stage for procrastination and doom ambitious goals to fail. When committing to a large project, it's easy to underestimate the effort needed. This leaves room for Rex to delay getting started until it's too late.
To avoid this, goals must be **SMART - specific, measurable, assignable, realistic and time-bound**. Breaking large goals into smaller, achievable steps makes steady progress more motivating than an overwhelming to-do list. Setting a reminder to review progress weekly further prevents stalling out of projects.

### Using Positive Reinforcement
For humans and animals alike, positive reinforcement strengthens desired behaviors more effectively thanwillpower alone. When starting a new productive routine, celebrate small wins to motivate continuing the behavior. 
Ideas for self-reward can include: treating yourself to a walk after each completed task, buying a small gift after meeting a deadline ahead of schedule or enjoying a favorite meal upon checking off multiple items from your to-do list. Pairing accomplishments with pleasant activities wires the brain to keep repeating them.

### Asking For Accountability 
Accountability to others besides just oneself can go a long way in staying on track. Whether telling a friend or colleague about your goals and progress, or enlisting a buddy to work alongside you, shared accountability supports follows through. 
Even just committing to sharing your time-blocking journal or to-do checklist with someone else on a weekly basis makes slacking off unwise and losing face detrimental. Knowing you'll have to explain yourself to others if falling behind keeps inner Rex in check. External motivation augments inner discipline for conquering procrastination habits.

In conclusion, overcoming procrastination requires self-awareness, knowledge of habit science, environmental control and positive reinforcement of new routines with realistic goals and accountability. Implementing a few techniques at a time helps change habits gradually for sustainable long-term behavior transformation. Understanding the struggle between instinct and reason brings clarity, while structure and support lend strength to self-mastery.
