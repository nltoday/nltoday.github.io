Patient advocacy and preventing medical errors are important responsibilities of registered nurses. However, fulfilling these duties can be difficult, especially when workloads are excessive. This article discusses real cases that highlight nurses' obligations and the systemic issues that sometimes impede their ability to properly care for patients.
### Recognizing Medical Prescription Errors 
My favorite story of a nurse catching a doctor's mistake involved **an internal medicine specialist hurrying to renew a patient's seizure medication**. In their haste, the doctor accidentally prescribed [Viagra instead of Levetiracetam](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-yoga-chi-chi-namaste-dog-chihuahua-dog), not realizing these were completely different drugs. Fortunately, the **medication administration record mix-up was noticed before the wrong drug reached the patient**. Catching such potentially serious prescription errors is a vital part of nurses advocating for patient safety.

### Intervening with a Colleague Misusing Drugs
In one Texas hospital, a registered nurse was gradually taking sharps containers from patient rooms over several months. She created a list of patients receiving IV opioids and would extract leftover medications using stolen needles. Eventually, multiple witnesses saw her **self-inject with drugs while on the job**. The nurse was fired and required to complete a program to keep her license after **diverting controlled substances from patients for personal use**. Nurses must intervene to stop any colleague endangering patients through substance abuse or other unethical acts.
### The Toll of Excessive Workloads 
A day in the life of a medical-surgical nurse highlighted the difficulties of heavy patient assignments. With **10 patients and 30 medication pumps to program before noon**, one nurse described being overwhelmed on the phone to her sister, an ICU nurse with only two patients that day. The med-surg nurse's distress shows how **unsafe patient-to-nurse ratios can compromise quality care**. 
### Speaking Up About Safety Concerns
Nurses are obligated to report mistakes, adverse events, or any situations that could harm patients. However, voicing such concerns can generate pushback, especially when workloads are unreasonably high. One ER nurse wrote an article advocating for reasonable nurse-to-patient ratios after a medication error almost happened due to the demands of her assignment. In response, the hospital suspended her without cause, showing how the system sometimes fails to support those who uphold patient advocacy.
### Caring for Too Many Severely Ill Patients
For ICU nurses trained in specialized lifesaving skills, caring for a large number of critically ill patients at once could invite errors. One experienced open-heart nurse described how managing just one or two post-op cardiac patients allowed focus on intricate care, rapid interventions if needed, and close monitoring of lab results and equipment. Attempting to care for 10 or more such complex patients simultaneously would exceed safe limits and compromise the level of diligence required.
### Providing Compassionate End-of-Life Care
Even with fewer patients, the emotional labor of end-of-life nursing deserves recognition. One oncology unit nurse recounted the intimacy of sitting with a dying patient, holding their hand through final moments as their sole caregiver. With six or more patients assigned, that level of emotional support and comfort could not be reasonably provided to all. Compassion fatigue also risks developing from the relentless exposure to suffering that larger assignments impose. Patients deserve nursing care where their humanity, not just tasks, can be dignified until the very end.
### Reform Through Collective Action and Political Will
To create real change, nurses must unite and advocate together for safe staffing through their unions, regulatory bodies, and political representatives. An association of Massachusetts nurses campaigned at the state level until a law was passed in 2004 establishing maximum nurse-to-patient ratios by unit type. Their success shows the power of collective action to reform flawed systems and protect both patients and the caregivers at the bedside. More support is still needed, but victories like this one provide a model for advocacy that can positively impact nursing practice and patient outcomes on a wider scale.
