Having a strong understanding of HTML and CSS is crucial as they form the building blocks of any website. With Codecademy, you can get comfortable with common HTML tags like `<div>`, `<p>`, and learn basic CSS properties and selectors within **2-3 days**. The key is to focus on structuring web pages with semantic HTML and styling elements with CSS rather than trying to memorize every tag and property.
