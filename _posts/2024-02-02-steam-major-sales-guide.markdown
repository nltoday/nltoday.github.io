### When Are the Next Sales?
Steam holds two major seasonal sales each year - the Summer Sale in late June or early July, and the Winter Sale around Christmas in late December or early January. Besides these major sales events, Steam also features smaller publisher-focused sales throughout the year.
While the exact dates of Steam's seasonal sales typically aren't announced far in advance, dedicated Steam sale trackers like WhenIsTheNextSteamSale.com provide estimates and leaks about upcoming deals based on previous years' schedules. For example, the [2022 Steam Summer Sale](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-is-my-valentine-funny-valentines-day-heart-dog-172-chihuahua-dog) is rumored to run from **June 22nd to July 5th** based on an unofficial leak, though Valve has yet to confirm. Staying updated on sale speculation and release calendar leaks is a good way to start preparing for major discounts.

### Add Games to Your Wishlist
One of the best ways to keep track of deals on specific Steam games you want is by adding them to your wishlist. Any time a game in your wishlist goes on sale, Steam will send a notification to the email address linked to your account. Having an organized wishlist makes it easy to check for discounts on your most wanted titles across Steam's various seasonal, publisher, and flash sales throughout the year. You can build and manage your wishlist directly from Steam or with the free mobile app.
### Watch For Franchise Bundle Deals
Major game franchises and series often see deep discounts applied to their entire catalogs during Steam sales. Bundle deals assemble multiple games from the **Total War**, Civilization, Tom Clancy's, Grand Theft Auto, or other long-running franchises at steep discounts. For strategy and simulation game fans in particular, keeping an eye out for franchise bundle promotions during sales can net numerous games for a fraction of their normal combined price. These collections provide a cost-effective way to experience several entries in a beloved series.
### Check Daily & Flash Sale Pages 
In addition to publisher focused sales, Steam typically features daily deal and flash sale pages during its major seasonal events. These rotate games in and out of a small selection of deeply discounted titles over the course of the sale period. Some standout discounts may only last for 8-24 hours so it's worth checking the featured daily and flash sales pages each day to catch any must-have games at their lowest price points. Following deal alerts on sites like isthereanydeal.com can also help you stay on top of which games are featured in these limited-time lightening deals.
### Average Discount Amounts to Expect
When browsing deals during Steam sales, it's good to have a sense of typical discount percentages to know what constitutes a good or great offer. In general, most games will see price cuts in the **50-75% off** range during major sales. According to historical sale data, **66-75% discounts** are common and bring prices down to their lowest seasonal levels for many titles. However, deeper discounts of **75-90%** or more on older games are certainly possible if you're willing to wait patiently for a standout offer. Knowing the average discounted price levels can help strategically pick up a number of games at once during big sale promotions.
### Take Advantage of Refunds 
While sales are a great opportunity to build up your game library, it's understandable to occasionally end up with something you just don't want to keep after the purchase excitement wears off. Don't fret though - Steam has a very forgiving return policy. As long as you play under two hours of a game and request a refund within two weeks of buying it, Valve will give you your money back with no questions asked. This risk-free way to "test drive" games during sales means you don't have to pass up potentially good deals just because you're unsure if a title is totally your cup of tea. With refunds providing a safety net, feel free to pick up more than a few discounted games to try out.
### Get Ready, Set, Save 
Between Steam's seasonal summer and winter sales, ongoing publisher promotions, and daily deal lightning rounds - there is no shortage of opportunities throughout the year to grow your game library affordably. By adding desired titles to your wishlist, tracking estimated sale dates, and understanding typical discount levels - you'll be well equipped to maximize savings when the next major Steam discounts arrive. So check sites like whenisthenextsteamsale.com , keep an eye on your wishlist emails, and get your wallet prepared - the digital bargains are always just around the corner.
