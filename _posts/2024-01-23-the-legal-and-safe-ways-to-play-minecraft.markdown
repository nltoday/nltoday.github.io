Minecraft is one of the most popular games in the world, allowing players to let their creativity run wild in a digital sandbox. However, as with any popular product, there are risks to be aware of when it comes to getting the game for free online. In this guide, we'll explore the legitimate and safe options for playing Minecraft, as well as warn of potential dangers from illegitimate free downloads.
## Minecraft Education Edition is Completely Free
### **Minecraft Education Edition longtail-keyword** 
Minecraft Education Edition is a completely free version of Minecraft specifically designed for educational use in schools. While many assume this means it has limited features compared to the paid versions, in reality Minecraft Education Edition is functionally identical to Bedrock Edition (the version available on mobile, consoles, and Windows 10). Players have access to all the same blocks, biomes, mobs, and gameplay as the paid versions. 
The only limitations are that worlds can only be accessed on the device they were created, and Realms multiplayer servers require a paid subscription. However, for solo or local multiplayer gameplay, Minecraft Education Edition provides the full Minecraft experience without any costs. Best of all, there are no risks of downloading viruses or illegal content. Minecraft Education Edition is directly available from Minecraft's official website, so it's 100% legitimate and safe to play.

## Playing on Friends' Accounts Can Be Safe Too
### **Account sharing longtail-keyword**
While technically against Minecraft's terms of use, sharing an account with friends can be a safe way to play Minecraft without purchasing it yourself, if done responsibly. The account owner would need to fully trust whoever they share login details with. It's important no payment information is compromised. Additionally, any worlds or creations on that account would be accessible by the other player. 
Provided all sharing is done between people the account owner personally knows and trusts, this can allow taking turns playing without incurring direct costs. Just be aware official multiplayer using Realms would not be possible this way. Account sharing may also violate Terms of Use down the line. But for occasional shared singleplayer, it removes virus risks compared to illegitimate downloads.
## Beware of "Free Minecraft" Download Sites 
### **Free minecraft download sites longtail-keyword**
Many search engine results will point to sites claiming to offer a "free Minecraft download" without purchase. However, in almost every case these prove to be scams that install malware, viruses or unauthorized illegal game copies instead of the true Minecraft experience. No legitimate website will provide the full paid version of the game completely free, as prominent game studios require income to continuously develop and maintain their titles. 
When a product everyone wants is promised for free, it's almost always too good to be true. These fake download sites exist only to infect users' devices with harmful software to steal passwords, bank details, or use the device to spread more malware. No amount of Minecraft is worth compromising the security of one's computer or digital life. The only truly safe options are either the paid Java/Bedrock editions from Minecraft.net or Minecraft Education Edition for educational purposes.
## Best to Purchase the Real Deal From Official Sources
### **Purchasing minecraft longtail-keyword**
For the full, official Minecraft experience with all legitimate features and multiplayer access, the only option is to purchase from the official storefronts. There are a few different editions available depending on platform:
- Java Edition - Available for Windows, macOS and Linux from Minecraft.net for $26.95. Best for modding. 
- Bedrock Edition - Available on Windows 10, Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, iOS and Android via respective stores. Usually $26.95 as well.
- Legacy Console Editions - Available on PS3, Xbox 360 but no longer updated. Can find used copies.
Purchasing from official stores ensures the game will be properly licensed to the account. Worlds, skins and marketplace content will not be at risk of disappearing due to illegitimate access. It also helps support continued development of Minecraft into the future. For most players, the enjoyment gained from the game is well worth the few dollars it costs to buy once legitimately.
## Summary - The Key Takeaways
In summary, there are safe and legitimate ways to play Minecraft without resorting to illegal "free" downloads online that usually contain malware instead of the game. Minecraft Education Edition provides the full experience for education purposes at no cost. Limited account sharing with trusted friends can work too within reason. But for the most official access across devices, it's best to purchase one of the paid editions to properly support Mojang Studios' continued efforts developing this block-building phenomena for many years to come. Always be wary of sites promising the improbable - if something seems too good to be true, it often is.
