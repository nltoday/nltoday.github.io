The Arrowverse introduced its first major television crossover event in 2016 with "Invasion!". This multi-show story brought together the heroes of four CW superhero series - Supergirl, The Flash, Arrow and Legends of Tomorrow - to unite against an invasion of alien Dominators. 
### # How Did It All Begin?
The "Invasion!" crossover was first teased at the end of the [eighth episode](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-holiday-funny-santa-saint-bernard-dog-christmas-tree-2) of **_Supergirl_**'s second season, titled "Medusa". **Barry Allen/The Flash** and **Cisco Ramon** unexpectedly arrived in National City to warn **Kara Danvers/Supergirl** about strange events occurring on their Earth. A small team-up between the heroes hinted at a larger crossover to come across the four shows.

### # The Flash Kicks off the Main Event
The true beginning of the crossover properly started with **_The Flash_**'s **eighth episode** of season three, named "**Invasion!**". Strange encounters with invisible aliens led **Team Flash** to investigate further. They learned the aliens, revealed as the **Dominators**, had been covertly abducting metahumans and were preparing for an invasion of Earth. Realizing the scope of the threat, Barry decided to recruit the help of allies like **Team Arrow** in Star City.
### # Star City Faces the Dominators 
In **Arrow's eighth episode** of its fifth season, also titled "**Invasion!**", **Oliver Queen/Green Arrow** and **Team Arrow** found themselves targeted by the **Dominators** as well. They had been secretly monitoring metahumans and vigilantes to prepare. Oliver agreed to work with **Barry Allen/The Flash** to track the **Dominators'** movements and defend their cities. However, it seemed the aliens' powers made them difficult opponents.
### # A Meeting on the Waverider 
On **_Legends of Tomorrow_**'s **seventh episode** of season two, dubbed "**Invasion!**" like the others, **Barry Allen/The Flash**, **Oliver Queen/Green Arrow** and others met on the **Waverider time ship** of the **Legends**. There, they decided the only way to defeat the advanced **Dominators** was to recruit even more powerful allies. They realized **Superman** of Earth-38, **Kara Danvers/Supergirl's** Earth, may be their best choice. A plan was hatched to bring in the **Man of Steel**.
### # Gathering the Forces to Take On the Dominators 
In a follow up episode of **_Supergirl_**, the combined heroes appealed to **J'onn J'onzz/Martian Manhunter** to help contact **Kara Danvers/Supergirl** on Earth-38. In a thrilling scene, she, **Clark Kent/Superman** and **Lois Lane** arrived on Earth-1. With the recruitment of these mighty allies, **Barry Allen/The Flash**, **Oliver Queen/Green Arrow**, **Kara Danvers/Supergirl** and the **Legends** knew they possessed the strength needed to fight off the technologically-advanced **Dominators**. They strategized how to properly utilize each hero's unique powers and talents to gain the upper hand in the coming invasion.
### # The Climactic Conclusion 
Across the final climactic chapters of each show, the heroes executed their plan to **outwit** and **overpower** the **Dominators**. After **several huge fights** across **National City, Star City** and **Central City**, they were able to **expose** the aliens' hidden **motivations** for invasion. Through the combined efforts of **The Flash, Arrow, Supergirl, Superman** and others, Earth's protectors triumphed in the end. Their victory proved the strength of **teamwork** and cemented their **places as the greatest superheroes** across the **Arrowverse**. The "Invasion!" crossover established a new era where the shows regularly joined forces for **epic crossovers**.
