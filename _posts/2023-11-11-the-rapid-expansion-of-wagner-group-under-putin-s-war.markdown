### Recruiting Convicts and Rebels for Combat
Evgeny Prigozhin's Wagner private military company has been aggressively recruiting fighters wherever it can find them. Sources reveal that Wagner has been releasing prisoners from Central African Republic jails who were convicted of serious crimes such as murder, rape, and armed robbery. According to former Wagner mercenaries, about 50 such prisoners have disappeared in recent months after being recruited, with their families given no information on their whereabouts. 
Wagner recruiters have also been picking up rebels detained for terrorist attacks in CAR villages, known for their extreme brutality. With full authority granted by the local government, Wagner continues operating across Africa and the Middle East while shrouded in secrecy.

### A Glimpse into Prison Recruitment Tactics  
In a shocking video leaked earlier this year, Yevgeny Prigozhin was seen directly appealing to [Russian prison inmates convicted of serious crimes](https://store.fi.io.vn/work-hard-so-my-rat-terrier-live-a-better-dog-lover-2) to join Wagner's forces in Ukraine. Offering pardons and high salaries, Prigozhin visited penal colonies across Russia to personally recruit inmates. Sources from multiple prisons confirmed Prigozhin's recruiting visits and prisoner testimonies describe the businessman promising freedom for those who survive **six months of frontline combat** in Ukraine.  
Experts question how effective these undertrained, undisciplined recruits could be. However, Russia's acute personnel shortage leaves few options for Putin as casualties mount in Ukraine. The leaked videos provide a rare glimpse into how far the Kremlin has come from fielding a professional military, relying instead on an assortment of contract soldiers and **now convict recruits** to wage its war.
### Wagner's Growing Role in Propping Up the Putin Regime
Originally operating in secrecy across war-torn regions, Wagner is increasingly functioning as an official extension of the Russian state. The group now boasts a massive headquarters and is directly aiding Putin's war effort by filling out decimated battalion tactical groups. 
Wagner founder Prigozhin has also taken on a public face, defending prison recruitment online. Experts believe the Kremlin relies on Wagner and similar proxy forces for tasks likerecruiting convicts that would be politically damaging if directly tied to Russia. As casualties rise and sanctions crush its economy, the Putin regime will likely depend further on Wagner and other shadowy groups to advance its objectives abroad while preserving plausible deniability at home.
### Expanding Franchises Across the Globe?  
Despite only operating officially in Russia and Africa so far, Wagner Group has seen exponential growth under Putin's patronage. Swelling from 250 fighters to a massive 40,000-strong force in under a decade, the group now has ambitions to franchising out its model internationally. 
There are rumors that Wagner is actively seeking partnerships with veteran special operators from foreign countries to help establish new branches. However, the group still values experience from elite special forces as it works to gradually spread its influence even wider. As political and economic pressures intensify on Moscow, Wagner's offshore franchises could provide a route for the Kremlin to project power while distancing itself from responsibility.
### A Grim Benchmark of Putin's Priorities  
The willingness to recruit convicts and combat veterans at massive scale marks Wagner as a unique hybrid force. But it also raises difficult questions about priorities for Putin and how far Russia has strayed from maintaining a professional military. 
Inmate testimonies describing Wagner recruitment visits as opportunities for "freedom or death" in Ukraine underscore the high-risk, expendable role convicts now play in the war. International law experts argue this constitutes illegal use of mercenaries and endangers civilian lives due to lack of proper combat training. 
Further normalization of conveying convict armies abroad could set a sobering precedent. As the death toll surges in Ukraine, it seems Putin prioritizes maintaining pressure through any means necessary over upholding military standards or protecting conscript lives. The rapid growth of Wagner Group serves as a sobering benchmark for how far Russia has pivoted its war strategy towards opacity and deniability.
