## Should I Stay or Should I Go? 
Jenna was at a crossroads in her marriage. She and her husband Ben had been together for 5 years and largely got along well. However, there was one major issue dividing them - whether or not to have children. 
Jenna had always dreamed of being a mother and starting a family. From a young age, she envisioned raising kids of her own one day. However, Ben did not share the same desire to become a parent. He enjoyed their current lifestyle with the freedom and flexibility to pursue their individual interests and hobbies without kids. 
After numerous discussions that went nowhere, Jenna realized they simply wanted different things that were incompatible long-term. **She needed to make a choice between staying in her marriage without children or pursuing motherhood through other means like divorce or waiting and hoping Ben would change his mind.** The decision weighing on her was not an easy one.
### Time for an Ultimatum
Fed up with going in circles, Jenna decided it was time to give Ben an ultimatum. She sat him down for a serious talk and laid all her feelings on the table. Jenna explained how deeply important having a family was to her and that she couldn't imagine not experiencing motherhood. She told Ben he needed to decide once and for all if he truly never wanted kids or was willing to reconsider. 
Ben was caught off guard by the ultimatum but understood where Jenna was coming from after years of failed discussions. He took some time to think it over carefully rather than give an impulsive answer. In the end, Ben's stance remained the same - he did not feel ready for parenting responsibilities and enjoyed their childfree lifestyle too much to change it.

### A Difficult but Necessary Decision
With Ben unwilling to compromise, Jenna realized staying married would mean never fulfilling her dream of having kids. That was not a sacrifice she was prepared to make. As hard as it was, divorce seemed to be the only option if she wanted a family **since being a single mother through other means like adoption or surrogacy was not preferable.**
She filed for divorce, moving out of their shared home into her own apartment. The separation period was emotional as they worked through lingering feelings while disentangling their lives legally and financially after so many years together. Ultimately, both believed it was for the best even if difficult in the short term. Now Jenna could start a new chapter focused on motherhood.
## A Rocky Road to Parenthood
While newly divorced, Jenna was determined to begin her parenthood journey as soon as feasible. She explored her options seriously, weighing the pros and cons of each path. Adoption held appeal but required a lengthy approval process she didn't want to spend years undergoing alone. Surrogacy also carried higher costs and legal complexities as a single woman. 
### An Unplanned Pregnancy
In the end, fate would deliver Jenna's chance at motherhood in an unexpected way. She reconnected with an old flame Alex who also longed for children one day. They began casually dating and growing closer. However, during one intimate encounter, the normal precautions fell through and Jenna became pregnant. 
At first, both panicked about the unplanned situation. Alex worried he wasn't ready to be a father either while Jenna feared raising a baby alone. After the initial shock wore off, her maternal instincts kicked in and Jenna couldn't imagine terminating the pregnancy now. She decided to continue with the unplanned but wanted pregnancy.
### Becoming a Single Mother
Though supportive of Jenna's choice, Alex did not feel equipped to be an actively involved co-parent. He told her he would offer financial assistance from afar but could not commit to a long-term parenting partnership. While disappointed, Jenna respected his honesty and prepared mentally to embark on single motherhood. 
The road ahead would be difficult but she was determined to give her child the loving home she never had growing up. **Jenna poured all her energy into caring for herself during the pregnancy and preparing for baby's arrival as a soon-to-be single mom.** She found community in other solo parenting networks for extra support during this new chapter.
## Life with a Newborn
At 35 weeks, Jenna gave birth to a healthy baby boy, Thomas. The flood of maternal love she experienced in those first moments more than made up for any prior doubts or fears. Holding her newborn in the hospital, Jenna felt deeply grateful to have realized her dream of parenthood at last.
### Adjusting to Motherhood 
The transition home was predictably exhausting yet rewarding. Jenna navigated long nights, endless feedings and diaper changes alone while learning on the fly. Family visited to lend extra hands when possible but she handled most of the newborn tasks independently with just Thomas by her side.
Some days felt overwhelming mentally and physically, especially during colicky crying fits. But Jenna powered through using all her maternal strength, deriving profound joy watching Thomas learn and grow each day. Slowly, their rhythms synchronized as she adjusted fully to solo parenting.
### Finding Her Village
Word spread of Jenna's success as a new single mom, inspiring other solo parents locally. She connected deeply with this chosen family, leaning on them for advice, babysitting help and community.Together they formed support systems, learned from each other and grew stronger in parenthood.
Jenna was proud and humbled witnessing Thomas achieve new milestones with her village by her side. Though the path was unconventional, she had more than she ever imagined - a healthy, thriving child and caring community of chosen relations. After years hoping, Jenna's dream of motherhood was finally realized.
