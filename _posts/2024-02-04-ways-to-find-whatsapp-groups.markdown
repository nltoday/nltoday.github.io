### Easiest Way to Find Your Own Groups
The simplest way to see which WhatsApp groups you have already joined is by messaging yourself on the app. First, save your number in your contacts and then locate it to see the WhatsApp message button. Click it to open your chat and then scroll down to view the "Groups in Common" section, which lists all the groups you share with yourself. This allows you to easily check how many groups you're currently a part of without any searching needed.

### Find Groups Through [Facebook Groups](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/alcorta) 
Facebook remains one of the top social media platforms for connecting with others who share similar interests. Many Facebook groups exist solely for the purpose of sharing **WhatsApp group links and topics**. By searching terms like "WhatsApp groups" or "WhatsApp group links" on Facebook, you can locate these groups and join. Once a member, simply make a post asking if anyone can share links to groups related to your interests or message group members directly. Frequent posters often provide active group invites through comments or private messages.
### Discover New Groups on **Blogs and Websites**
In addition to Facebook, some blogs and websites curate constantly updated lists of public WhatsApp groups organized by topic or category. A top site for this is Top Communities, which maintains an extensive database of groups covering everything from hobbies and news to business and education. By exploring their directories, you're almost guaranteed to find several relevant groups without needing personal invites. Other general interest sites occasionally feature WhatsApp group roundups as well.
### Ask Friends For **Referrals and Invitations**  
Of course, one of the easiest ways is to leverage your own social networks. Simply ask close friends and contacts if they belong to any groups related to your **hobbies, interests or profession** that you could join. People are usually happy to refer others to communities they actively participate in. You can also privately message friends on WhatsApp and request an invite to specific groups they may be admin of. Personal referrals often have high success rates for acceptance.
### Use Generic Group Names As **Search Queries**
While WhatsApp itself does not offer a search feature, you aren't completely without options. By crafting generic group names as Facebook search queries, you have a chance of stumbling upon relevant public groups. For example, searching "photography enthusiasts WhatsApp group" or "coding help group WhatsApp" may surface posts by admins sharing invitation links. It's a long shot but worth a try if all other methods fail. Joining even just one new community often opens doors to others. 
### Ask Within Existing Groups For **Related Community Recommendations**
Once you've joined some initial WhatsApp groups, another underutilized technique is questioning members directly for additional group recommendations. In most active communities, regulars will be plugged into many similar circles. By simply asking in your signature line or during idle conversation if anyone can recommend any other interesting groups, other members may offer invites they control or provide specific group links or names to search for on other platforms. Established groups become a gateway to expanding your overall network.
### Stay Updated on Group Sites and Forums For **New Group Announcements**
Rather than intermittent searches, consider regularly checking sites like Top Communities that index WhatsApp groups. Group owners and moderators frequently post notices of newly formed circles looking for members. Subscribe to their email newsletters or social channels to get prompt alerts whenever fresh groups launch within your categories of interest. Dedicated WhatsApp group forums may also have specific subsections where people advertise their latest communities. Be an active viewer to quickly hop on board ground-floor groups before membership caps.
### Conclusion
In summary, there are many productive ways to find WhatsApp groups that don't require the app itself to have official search or explore features. By leveraging existing communities, websites, blogs and your connections on alternative social networks, anyone can expand their membership in private message groups covering their favorite topics. With a combination of the methods above, continuously building your WhatsApp group network has never been easier.
