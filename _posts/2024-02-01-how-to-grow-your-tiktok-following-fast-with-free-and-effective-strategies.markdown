## Target Your Niche Audience 
Choosing a specific niche or topic helps you attract the right followers who resonate with your content. Instead of trying to please everyone, focus your efforts on a particular subject you're passionate about. For example, if you love cooking, create cooking-related videos. This allows you to better connect with your target audience and grow a highly engaged following. You'll start seeing increases in views, likes and new followers as more people from your niche discover your account and see your videos in their For You feed. Targeting a niche also makes it easier to produce compelling **cooking tutorial videos** or **healthy recipe demonstrations** that provides value to your audience.
## Optimize Your Posting Times
The time you post can significantly impact how many people see your videos. Take time to experiment posting at different hours of the day and days of the week. Analyze the analytics to see when your videos perform best. Once you find the optimal timeslots, consistently publish new content during those time periods. For example, you may find posting around lunchtime on weekdays or late evenings on weekends get you the highest views. Make it a habit to publish **food videos** or **cooking challenge videos** at the times that work best for your followers.
## Engage in Trends 
Jumping on trends is a great way to reach new audiences on TikTok. Look for popular sounds, challenges, or videos trending on the discovery page and put your own creative spin on them. You can also duet or stitch trending videos from other creators to pull their followers to your account. Participating in trends helps get your videos in front of more eyes. For a cooking niche, some trends you could try are **three ingredient recipe challenges** or **what's in my fridge cooking videos**.
## Cross Promote on Other Platforms
While building your TikTok presence, promote your account on other social networks as well. Share links to your new TikTok videos on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest or your blog to gain followers from existing communities.

Hashtags help surface your videos to the right audience beyond just your followers. Include relevant hashtags related to your niche like #cooking, #baking, #recipes, #foodie when posting new videos. You can even create your own hashtag that becomes synonymous with your brand. Hashtags allow people searching specific topics to more easily find your videos. With food related hashtags, include ones for dishes you demonstrate like #chickenalfredo or preparation methods #onepotmeals.

Getting involved in the TikTok community through comments and interactions increases your chances of gaining new followers. Like, comment and share videos from accounts in your niche. You can also start conversations by asking questions. Respond to comments on your videos to build rapport. Engagements show people you're an active member and encourage them to check out your profile too.
