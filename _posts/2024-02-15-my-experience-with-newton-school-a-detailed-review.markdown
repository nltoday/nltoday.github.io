### Why I Applied
Like many others, I was attracted by the colorful advertisements of Newton School on Instagram. They promised a 6-month course to learn full stack development along with guaranteed job placements. Being unemployed, it appeared like a golden opportunity.

### Problems Started Early On  
Within a month of starting, Newton School stopped taking online classes for everyone except students from IITs. Even though I was performing well, ranking among the top 4 students, I was denied access to classes without reason. 
### Unexpected Fee Demands
When I asked about it, Newton School demanded I pay â‚¹50,000 upfront to continue the course - something they never disclosed during admissions. Many others faced similar treatment. It became clear they lured students with fake promises but had no intentions of actually training us without extra fees.
### Subpar Teaching and Support  
Those who could afford the fees found the quality of teaching and support disappointing. Teachers became unavailable for doubts and project assistance. Pre-recorded lectures from past batches were passed off as "live" sessions. Communication from mentors was also poor or absent.
### Placement Assistance was a Sham
After 6 months, Newton School denied providing placement assistance citing insufficient "mentor hours" - something entirely out of students' control. Even with good projects, they kept finding excuses to avoid placements. It was evident they had no real industry partnerships. 
### Legal Intimidation for Sake of  Commissions  
When I sought placement on my own with help from friends, Newton School took no credit. Instead, they threatened legal action to force me into paying hefty commission under their dubious "Income Sharing Agreement". They kept harassing me with calls for months over the same.
### Fake and Paid Reviews Mislead Others
It was clear Newton School's glowing online reviews and recommendations were mostly fake, having ties to the founders or paid employees. They even posted fake reviews on Quora under different identities to suppress negative views. Genuine reviews from unsatisfied 90% were cleverly hidden away.
### Better Learning Alternatives Exist
In hindsight, I should have opted for reputed platforms like Udemy or Coursera which offer higher quality [online course](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahua-ride-shotgun-vintage-moon-broom-witch-halloween) at more reasonable prices without traps or false commitments. Their learning resources and self-paced models are far more effective for **tech skills** growth compared to the dubious training practices of Newton School and similar startups.
### Concluding Thoughts  
My advice is to thoroughly research any edtech institute before enrolling - check reviews from several independent sources, ask about placement rates and look for red flags. Students deserve transparency and good learning experiences free from misleading claims or unjust profiteering motives. I hope sharing my honest review prevents others from similar troubles.
