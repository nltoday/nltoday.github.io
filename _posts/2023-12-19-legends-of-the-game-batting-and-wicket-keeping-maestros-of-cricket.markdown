## Unorthodox Batting Brilliance
Virender Sehwag was known for his unorthodox yet hugely effective batting style that terrified bowlers around the world. Some key highlights of his illustrious career included:
### **Aggressive opening batsman with supreme self-belief**
Despite initial doubts over his technique when he was asked to open the batting for India, Sehwag proved the doubters wrong with his fearless approach at the crease. He believed in his own abilities and backed himself to take on any bowling attack, which made him one of the most entertaining batsmen to watch during his prime.

Sehwag struck fear in the hearts of bowlers everywhere with his unconventional yet effective style of play. He was the only Indian batsman to consistently dominate world class spinners on turning tracks in Sri Lanka. His **“see ball, hit ball”** approach changed situations single-handedly and broke many bowling attacks.
