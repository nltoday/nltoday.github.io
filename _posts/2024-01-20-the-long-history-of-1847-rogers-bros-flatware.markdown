Rogers Bros was one of the most famous and prolific names in American silver and silverplate manufacturing throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. Their [1847 Rogers Bros](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/aldinger) flatware pattern remains one of the most popular and recognizable patterns today. However, the true story behind this iconic brand name is complex with many twists and turns.
### The Rogers Brothers Origins
The Rogers story began in 1847 when Asa, William, and Simeon Rogers established a small silver shop in Hartford, Connecticut to manufacture solid silver utensils. Known for their craftsmanship and designs, the brothers gained popularity throughout New England. In 1853, William and Asa Rogers expanded the business, incorporating as Rogers Brothers Manufacturing Company. Meanwhile, their brother Simeon established his own successful silversmith operations.

### Transition to Silver Plating
By the 1860s, economic factors led many American silversmiths like Rogers Brothers to transition from producing solid silver items to silver plating base metals to lower costs. In 1862, the brothers signed a deal with Meriden Britannia Company to produce their designs in silverplated form under the **1847 Rogers Bros** stamp. This allowed the trademark to reach a mass market for the first time.
### Growth and Success
Over subsequent decades, the **1847 Rogers Bros** name grew tremendously in popularity and recognition across the United States and beyond. By the late 1800s, dozens of companies were manufacturing wares under the brand often without any connection to the original Rogers family. This led to inconsistent quality and legal disputes over trademark usage which continue to this day.
### Mergers and Acquisitions 
In the late 19th century, large-scale consolidation swept the American metalware industries. Rogers Brothers Manufacturing merged with William Rogers & Son and several other firms connected to the Rogers family in 1898 to form the massive new **International Silver Company**. This made International Silver the primary creator and defender of authentic **1847 Rogers Bros** patterns for decades.
### Reinventing Tradition
As tastes changed in the early 20th century, International Silver began introducing new designs while maintaining signature **1847 Rogers Bros** styles like Haviland, Oneida and Franconia. Stylized adaptations of historical patterns kept the brand relevant through multiple design eras. Reinvention of tradition remains key to enduring brand recognition today.
### Ownership Transitions
Ownership of the historic Rogers trademarks went through several transitions in the 1900s. In 1929, **Oneida Ltd** acquired most Rogers assets. Oneida continued creating new patterns steeped in the classic Rogers aesthetic. In the 1980s, **Community Silver** obtained the Rogers patterns and later Foley bought this division, becoming the modern custodians of **1847 Rogers Bros**.
### Heritage and Authenticity
Today, only flatware and hollowware explicitly stamped **"1847 Rogers Bros"** can claim direct lineage to the original silversmith brothers. However, the Rogers artistic vision lives on through interpretations of their designs which remain staples of pattern silver and gifting. Careful brand stewardship ensures this heritage of American metalcraft endures.
### Collecting 1847 Rogers Bros Today 
Antique **1847 Rogers Bros** pieces from the 1800s command high prices from devoted collectors. However, reproductions and modern interpretations also have significant value reflective of the brand's enduring appeal and familiar artistic language.Whether collecting vintage patterns or contemporary interpretations, **1847 Rogers Bros** represents the pinnacle of American silversmithing tradition and design.
### Legacy of an Iconic Name

Through multiple ownership transitions and generations of artisans, both veritable antiques and modern pieces built on the original aesthetic keep the pioneering spirit of Rogers alive.
