### # Discovering my Attachment
As far back as I can remember, I had a strong attachment to pull-up diapers. From the age of 7 until 10, I regularly wet the bed and would wear my wet overnight pull-up into the late morning or early afternoon instead of changing. While others may have seen this as abnormal, it brought me comfort. By high school, I started regularly ordering better adult diapers online and wore them whenever I wasn't at school or work. [Wearing diapers for comfort and security](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/aberle) became an important part of my daily routine.

### # Following in my Brother's Footsteps     
Seeing how my twin brother relied on diapers due to his developmental issues, I started to feel envious of the extra time and care he received from our mom during diaper changes. At age 10, I intentionally began wetting the bed so that I too could wear diapers again. Within a few short months, I progressed to having daytime accidents as well. Our mom made the decision to put me back in diapers full time until I was accident-free. **Wearing diapers for attention and bonding with family** became a regular part of my life from then on.
### # Exploring Diapers as an Adult      
During my late teenage years, I found myself missing the comfort of diapers even after accidents stopped. At 18 years old, around the same time my younger sister became incontinent, I decided to try diapers again, purchasing some women's Depend underwear from a store in another town. The feeling of security and childhood nostalgia they provided was just as I remembered. **Wearing diapers as an adult for nostalgia and comfort** led me to make diapers a long-term lifestyle choice.
### # Embracing My Journey      
Today at age 19, I continue to wear diapers 24/7 for reasons both emotional and physical. While my mother no longer helps with changes, she understands and supports my needs, still providing diapers. **Wearing diapers with acceptance and support from loved ones** has allowed me to accept this part of myself. Though not a conventionally easy path, embracing my journey with diapers brings me fulfilling attachments I treasure.
### # Looking Towards the Future       
As an adult diaper wearer, I aim to live openly while prioritizing self-care. Over time, I hope to build community with others in similar situations to feel less isolated in my experience. **Wearing diapers openly while finding community and support** could help sustain my well-being for years to come. Overall, I am proud of how far I have come in journeying with diapers and excited to see where this aspect of my identity continues guiding me.
