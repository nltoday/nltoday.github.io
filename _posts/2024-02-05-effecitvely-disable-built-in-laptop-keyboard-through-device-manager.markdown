### Identifying the Issue
Many users face unwanted keyboard inputs even when the keyboard is closed. This leads to frustration and loss of productivity. The root cause could be dust or key presses getting triggered accidentally. [Unwanted keyboard input issues](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/adkinson) become more prominent after system updates as new drivers are installed. It is important to troubleshoot and identify the specific keyboard creating problems.

### Checking for Latest Drivers
One should always ensure having the latest keyboard drivers installed. Outdated drivers could be one reason behind glitches. To check for updates:
- Open Device Manager and expand 'Keyboards' 
- Right click the keyboard and select 'Properties'
- Check the 'Driver' tab for the date and look for any updates
- Visit the laptop manufacturer's support site to download the latest driver 
Updating to the latest version may fix bugs introduced in older releases. However, if the issues persist even after updating, it's time to consider disabling the problematic keyboard.
### Restricting Automatic Driver Installation 
Before uninstalling the driver, it is wise to restrict Windows from automatically reinstalling it on restart. This can be done through Group Policy Editor:
- Open gpedit.msc and navigate to 'Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Device Installation'
- Double click 'Prevent installation of devices not described by other policy settings' and set it to 'Enabled'
This will stop Windows from reinstalling the uninstalled driver without our permission.
### Uninstalling the Built-in Keyboard Driver
Now we can safely uninstall the driver: 
- Open Device Manager and expand 'Keyboards'
- Right click the internal keyboard and select 'Uninstall'  
- Confirm the uninstallation on the popup window
The internal keyboard should now be **functionally disabled** without a driver.
### Testing the Fix
Reboot the system to see if the issue is resolved. During startup, the keyboard LEDs may not light up indicating the driver removal was successful. Try typing or gently pressing keys to confirm there is no accidental input. 
If the problem persists, check for any other possible culprit like fragmented files causing ghost key presses. Otherwise, the driver removal has fixed the unwarranted keyboard operations.
### Re-enabling the Keyboard 
To bring back the keyboard functionality:
- Open Device Manager and right click an empty space to update driver software  
- When prompted, select 'Have Disk' and browse to point it an .inf file from the manufacturer's driver package.
- Once found, the driver will reinstall and the keyboard will be up and running again.
Don't forget to revert the Group Policy setting to allow automatic driver installation in future.
### Alternative Methods for Permanently Disabled Keyboards 
In some cases, even after trying different keyboards, the issue doesn't go away. Here are some alternatives:  
- Connect an external keyboard for all operations and completely disable the built-in one in BIOS.
- If BIOS access isn't possible, execute PowerShell commands to **permanently disable the PS/2 port driver** and connect an external USB keyboard.
- As last resort, open the laptop and physically disconnect the internal keyboard's ribbon cable from the motherboard. 
While inconvenient, these ensure the problematic keyboard no longer disturbs work.
### Troubleshooting Other Possible Culprits
Before completely disabling the keyboard, it's worth investigating other components that may be contributing to the phantom inputs:
- Check for any damaged or sticky keys that trigger presses when laptop is closed. Clean them with compressed air.
- Test if the touchpad is working correctly or accidentally moving mouse cursor. Disable it if erratic. 
- Examine if the laptop hinges are putting pressure on any keys while closing. Readjust if needed.
- Look for any swelled batteries exerting pressure inside. Replace to rule out this unlikely cause.
- Try using the laptop on a solid surface away from electromagnetic fields.
Isolating the actual source is important for a lasting solution without compromising usability.
