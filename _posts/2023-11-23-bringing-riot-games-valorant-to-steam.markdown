Almost a decade after its launch, Steam remains the dominant platform for PC gaming. However, some developers choose to release their games outside of Steam. In this article, we will discuss why Riot Games' Valorant is unlikely to come to Steam and the advantages of Steam overall.
### Valorant's Success Outside of Steam
Riot Games developed Valorant as a competitive first-person shooter that directly competes with games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. However, Valorant is only available through Riot's own platform. As the creator of hugely successful **multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game League of Legends**, Riot has already established an extensive userbase and reputation outside of Steam. Since Valorant's 2020 launch, it has seen strong player numbers and ranked highly in streaming views. As one of the few large developers operating independently of Steam, Riot likely feels they do not need Steam to further Valorant's success.

### Steam's Advantages for Developers and Players
While bypassing Steam's revenue share is appealing for developers, the platform provides many benefits. Steam offers developers an **easy-to-use digital storefront and content delivery network** to reach a massive existing PC gaming audience. Users can track their game libraries, connect with friends, and discover new titles on Steam. The service also provides developers with robust **multiplayer, cloud saves, achievements, trading cards**, and more features to enhance their games. For players, Steam regularly holds massive sales, allowing them to build substantial game collections at deep discounts. Its community features foster vibrant game discussions and make connecting over multiplayer seamless.
### Riot's Self-Sustaining Ecosystem
Despite Steam's strengths, Riot has little incentive to bring Valorant there currently. [As the largest PC game company worldwide](https://store.fi.io.vn/cottagecore-aesthetic-axolotl-mushroom-hat-shroomxolotl-129/men&), Riot owns the League of Legends IP and brand, allowing them to shape dedicated esports scenes and generate ongoing revenue streams. They operate their own launcher, friends system, and store to distribute not just Valorant but other future games. Much like how Epic Games maintains its own platform for Fortnite and other titles, **Riot aims to control their own destiny rather than rely on third parties like Steam**. Unless player interest in Valorant noticeably declines outside of Steam, the shooter seems set to remain on Riot's standalone platform indefinitely.
### Steam's Ongoing Relevance 
While giants like Riot, Epic, and Blizzard have launchers for their own games, Steam retains its position due to accumulated benefits for both studios and audiences. Developers utilizing Steamworks features can save substantial resources versus building equivalent tech in-house. Players get a centralized place to easily access all their games, connect with the global PC community, and benefit from Steam Sales. Going forward, Steam will continue coexisting with other platforms by emphasizing its **convenience and unparalleled game discoverability functions**. Even as self-publishing options emerge, Steam endures as the cornerstone of the PC gaming ecosystem.
### Expansive Catalog and Dedicated Fanbase
Another reason Valorant may never arrive on Steam relates to the platform's massive existing catalog. With a library of over 50,000 games, Steam constantly surfaces a wealth of new and classic titles for its 500 million registered users to discover. In comparison, Riot's platform exclusively hosts their own games so far. Releasing on Steam could potentially dilute Valorant player numbers across the platform's sprawling selection. The first-person shooting genre also remains dominated by games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Team Fortress 2 which have stewarded dedicated communities on Steam for over a decade. It may prove difficult for Valorant to gain traction amongst Steam's hardened fanbases for similar games. Unless player interest sharply declined, keeping Valorant exclusive maintains its visibility for Riot's dedicated audience.
### Focus on Own Platform and Ip Control
In summary, **Riot Games has little incentive to bring Valorant to Steam currently.** As one of the premier developers operating independently of Steam, Riot aims to fully control their own player ecosystem and IP. Thanks to the ongoing popularity of League of Legends, they have established a large dedicated audience for their games outside of Valve's platform. Unless user engagement with Valorant noticeablywanes in the future, it seems the competitive shooter will remain exclusive to Riot's customized launcher and storefront. Between their existing fan base and benefits of self-publishing, Riot can concentrate on cultivating Valorant and their brand separate from Steam's third-party involvement for the foreseeable future.
