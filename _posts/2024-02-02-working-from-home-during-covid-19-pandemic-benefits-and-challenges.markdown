### A Blessing in Disguise 
The ongoing covid-19 pandemic has affected the lives of people across the world. While it has brought untold misery to many, it has also opened new opportunities for some. As a [data engineer working for a US client](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/akridge), I have been working from home for the last 3 months due to the pandemic. Initially it seemed like a restriction but I soon realized it had its benefits. Being able to stay safe with family during these uncertain times has been a privilege. My wife, who also works in the IT sector, is relieved to see us under the same roof. We are both saving money as well as time otherwise spent on daily commutes and personal expenses.

### Relishing Hometown Life  
Given a chance to work remotely, my wife and I decided to spend these days at our hometown near Nashik, Maharashtra. Here we are enjoying the simplicities of life away from city chaos. Breathing fresh air, having home cooked meals and spending time with extended family have worked wonders for our physical and mental well-being. I am also helping my father in agricultural activities after office hours. Lending a supporting hand in farm work helps me stay fit. The change of environment has rejuvenated me.
### Challenges of Remote Working
While working from home has its perks, it also poses challenges. Maintaining a proper work schedule and securing reliable internet connectivity can be difficult tasks. It is really hard to stay focused without a dedicated workplace. Any technical glitches that would have been fixed within minutes in office take longer to resolve remotely. With immense workload pressure, it is also not possible to contribute much in household chores. ** Late night client meetings often disturb family members. Additionally, the lines between professional and personal hours get blurred as office work spills over into weekends and evenings. All this leads to mental fatigue over long term.
### Reinforcing Family Bonds 
One of the biggest positives of spending time at our native is strengthened family ties. My wife is able to contribute more in household activities with my mom's support. This free up precious time for each other and for our personal hobbies. We indulge in recreational sports and games with cousins on a daily basis, helping us maintain fitness and refreshing our minds. Frequent interactions with extended relatives have deepened our bonds. Our parents are also happy to have their children around during these trying times. Overall, staying connected to roots has brought us inner joy and strength.
### Planning for Post-Pandemic Future
With my current experience, moving back permanently to native seems like a viable option worth considering. Land and living expenses are significantly lower here compared to city life. Income generated from agricultural activities can supplement our salaries over the long run. Additionally, relocating would give us optimum work-life balance sans daily commutes and high rents. However, uncertainties over stable internet and occasional power cuts remain concerns. One way could be negotiating with employer to allow **permanent work from home** for locals. With advancements in communication technology, such hybrid working models may become common post Covid era.
### Striking a Balance 
Overall, remote working during pandemic has been a mixed bag offering both opportunities and difficulties. While the perks of staying with family in serene hometown are highly appreciable, professional constraints cannot be ignored either. Perhaps, the ideal scenario would be to strike a balance - Spend majority of the year in native reconnecting with roots, while going to present workplace for short project-related visits. This hybrid model would help optimally leverage mental and financial benefits of both city and village lifestyle. With continued support of employers, employees may carve flexible yet mutually fruitful careers going forward.
### Envisioning an Agriculture Startup  
As someone passionate about farming since childhood, I am exploring options to convert 5 acres of my agricultural land into a small startup. With technical knowledge and business management skills gained over years, establishing a **mixed-crop precision farming** venture is a long-cherished dream. Taking initial steps like soil testing, selecting suitable high-yield crops and automating irrigation. In future, more modern techniques around pest control, supply chain and marketing can be incorporated. If successful, it will support livelihoods of local farmers too. With favourable government policies, localized Agri-business ventures could help catalyse rural economy on large scale.
### Conclusion
To sum up, the ongoing pandemic has opened new opportunities as well as avenues for positive lifestyle changes. While remote working comes with its challenges, staying connected to roots offers immense mental satisfaction. A balanced hybrid model leveraging benefits of both urban employment and rural living seems viable going forward. Establishing localized Agri ventures could also boost rural economy on mass scale. With continued support and innovative solutions, the post Covid world may witness more flexible yet impactful career and business models.
