### Early Days
It is said that rugby union was popularised in France by Pierre de Coubertin in the late 19th century. As the founder of the International Olympic Committee, de Coubertin felt that rugby would make French men more masculine and rugged, countering what he saw as an "effeminate" culture. While the sport gained some followers, it remained far less popular than football for many decades.

### A Southwestern Stronghold
Rugby first took firm root in southwest France, centred around Bordeaux. [Many attribute this to the influence of British sailors and merchants](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/ahl), who brought the game with them as they frequented the ports. The pastoral, tight-knit communities of the region warmly embraced rugby. To this day, every village has its own team competing fiercely under the church bells each Sunday. Rugby here is more than a sport - it is a social institution and a point of local pride.
### Spread Through the South 
In the early 20th century, rugby exploded in popularity across the southwest and the rest of southern France. **Charismatic coaches transmitted their passion for the game to new generations of players.** Southern cities like Toulouse and Montpellier emerged as hotbeds for the sport. Rugby clubs proliferated and local derbies became spectacles that whole communities would attend. While football remained number one nationally, rugby usurped its place in the south.
### Rise of Professionalism
The advent of professionalism in 1995 was a boon for French rugby. **Television coverage exposed new audiences to exciting, technically proficient rugby.** Top 14 clubs could now attract the very best talent from around the world with lucrative contracts. Standards rose dramatically as players dedicated themselves fully to training. French rugby began to make its mark internationally, reaching three Rugby World Cup finals. 
### An Appeal to French Sensibilities
There are reasons beyond geography for rugby's popularity in France. The fluid, running style of play that the French perfected is both visually pleasing and requires intelligence, skill and teamwork. Meanwhile, the physical confrontation satisfies a desire for passionate aggression. Rugby allows the French to showcase both their creative flair and their toughness.
### Rugby Culture Throughout the Nation
While rugby remains strongest in the south and southwest, its culture has permeated the entire country. Over 400,000 players are registered across 2,000 clubs nationwide. Major cities like Paris, Lyon and Clermont-Ferrand have successful pro teams drawing large crowds. The national team Les Blues are followed avidly wherever they compete. Rugby has truly become France's second sport, with aspirations to one day surpass football at the top. With their proven quality, that goal may not be far off.
### Cementing Rugby's Status 
French rugby is still striving for a breakthrough World Cup win that could propel it to new heights of popularity nationally. The talent and passion for the game are undoubtedly there. Meanwhile, the Top 14 continues to entertain millions of TV viewers weekly with skillful, competitive matches. As long as clubs like Toulouse and Clermont sustain their tradition of excellence, and the national team remains a force, rugby's standing in France is secure for generations to come. The pioneering work of Pierre de Coubertin is complete - rugby is now deeply ingrained in the French sporting psyche and culture.
