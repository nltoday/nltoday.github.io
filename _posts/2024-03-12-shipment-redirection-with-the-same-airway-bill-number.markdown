## Reasons for Shipment Redirection
Courier companies often redirect shipments to new addresses or destinations under the original Airway Bill number (AWB) for various valid reasons. Some of the common causes of redirection include:
### Wrong Pincode Provided
One of the most frequent reasons is an incorrect pincode being provided by the sender. Since shipment tracking and movement is managed based on the pincode, the parcel ends up getting delivered to the wrong location. Upon noticing the address mismatch, courier staff redirect it to the destination with the accurate pincode.

### Request by Sender or Receiver  
Redirection may also occur as requested by the consignor or consignee. For example, if the receiver's office address was updated but the old address was mentioned, they can ask for it to be sent to the new location instead. Similarly, senders can initiate a change if they provide the wrong address initially.
### Dual Address Customers
Large corporations and businesses often maintain more than one delivery point - their head office address and local branch addresses. In such cases, redirection allows routing the shipment to the alternative address linked to the same AWB number, as preferred by the customer.
## Tracking Redirection under the Original AWB
When a shipment faces issues like incorrect pincode or address that necessitates redirection, courier companies update the new delivery location details in their system against the original AWB number. This ensures seamless [tracking of redirected shipments](https://store.fi.io.vn/play-well-with-others-otter-lover-animal-marine-biologist-1) using the same tracking number throughout the transit journey.
Customers can continue monitoring shipment status updates on the courier website or via SMS alerts by entering only their original AWB number provided at the time of booking. The redirection is reflected in status changes visible to them for end-to-end **visibility of shipment movement**. This offers convenience to customers rather than assigning a separate tracking code for the redirected package.
## Customer Benefits of Same AWB Redirection
Allowing redirection while retaining the original AWB brings significant advantages to customers:
### Single Tracking Number 
It eliminates confusion that could arise from having multiple tracking codes issued for a single package. Users only need to remember one AWB to trace shipment progress at any stage.
### Seamless Visibility
As status updates persist under the same tracking mechanism, customers have seamless visibility into interruptions caused by redirection and resumption of transit to final destination. 
### Convenience 
Managing redirection with a single AWB number, instead of assigning new tracking codes, offers convenience to customers through a unified shipment tracking experience on a single identification code.
## Conclusion
The ability to redirect shipments to alternate addresses or destinations while retaining the original Airway Bill number ensures convenience and seamless tracking for customers. It prevents issues arising from having to deal with multiple tracking codes for a single package movement impacted due to reasons like incorrect addresses. Courier companies like BluDart thus enhance customer experience through this unified redirection and tracking mechanism using the same AWB.
