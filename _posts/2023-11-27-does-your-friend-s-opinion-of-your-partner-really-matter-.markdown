Friends play an important role in our lives. So it's natural to value their opinions, especially when it comes to significant relationships. But does a friend's disapproval necessarily mean you should break up? Here are some perspectives on how much friend's opinions really matter in relationships.
### Attraction Matters Most 
At the end of the day, attraction is personal. Whether friends approve or disapprove, what truly matters is if *you* find your partner physically and emotionally attractive. As one Redditor shared, his aunt initially said his girlfriend was ugly, but he knew that wasn't true - *he* thought she was hot. Two months later, even his aunt admitted she was pretty. [physical attraction](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/adkisson) and emotional connection form the core of any relationship. As long as those exist between you and your partner, outside opinions become less relevant.

### Friends Don't Define Your Happiness 
It's understandable to value friends' views, but their disapproval shouldn't dictate your relationship choices or happiness. Friends may not fully understand your partner like you do as someone in the relationship. Dumping someone just because friends say unfavorable things is letting others control your life. As another Redditor pointed out, he cared what friends thought but wouldn't break up solely due to that - he dated people **he found attractive**. Your happiness in a relationship depends on how you and your partner feel about each other, not outsider judgments.
### Beware Of Hidden Agendas
Friends' critiques aren't always well-intentioned or objective. Sometimes jealousy, personal biases or selfish motives color their opinions. One Reddit poster recalls how quickly his ex turned on her after friends made rude remarks - it damaged their relationship. Be wary if friends become unusually hostile towards a partner for vague reasons. There may be underlying reasons for dislike unrelated to genuine concern for you. Don't let friends manipulate you into **second guessing your relationship choices**.
### Supportive Friends Want Your Happiness  
Of course, not all friend opinions stem from jealousy or bias. Genuinely caring friends want your well-being and may privately raise valid concerns if they see flaws impacting you negatively long-term. The key is how the feedback is delivered. Supportive friends discuss issues respectfully and accept your autonomy over decisions. They don't constantly badmouth a partner or try controlling who you date. If most friends are consistently disapproving without reasonable justification, it says more about them than your partner. Focus on friends aiming to understand you and respect what makes you happy in life and relationships.
### Weigh Friend Input Carefully
In the end, no one knows your relationship like you do as an active participant. But isolating yourself from all outside input isn't wise either. The healthy approach is thoughtfully weighing different perspectives - including friends' - then making your own informed choice. Give friends a respectful hearing if concerns seem sincere and backed by clear rationale. But remember the final call is yours after reflecting on your and your partner's feelings, priorities, values and compatibility. Outside views alone shouldn't disrupt a good relationship or undermine your self-confidence and views of a partner.
### Prioritize Respect In Any Relationship 
Regardless of friend opinions, showing respect towards your partner is paramount. As the Reddit story highlighted, readily agreeing with biting friend criticisms destroyed that man's relationship when his loyalty should have been with his girlfriend. Prioritizing respect means standing up for your partner to friends if needed, instead of joining in rude attacks. It means openly communicating with your partner regarding any friend issues that surface instead of keeping them in the dark. With respect and open communication, many relationship issues stemming from friend opinions can often be constructively addressed.
