### The Accidental Death
In the Injustice universe, Damian Wayne was trained by his father Batman to be a lethal fighter and skilled assassin. However, even the best fighters are susceptible to losing control in moments of rage. During a heated argument with Nightwing, Damian threw a baton in anger that struck Richard Grayson and caused him to fall and break his neck on the rocks below. It was [clearly an accident](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/agrawal), as Damian had no intention of killing his mentor and friend. Still, the loss of Nightwing weighed heavily on both Damian and Batman.

### Joining the Regime
Unable to find forgiveness from his father, Damian aligned himself with Superman's regime in the aftermath of Nightwing's death. Superman valued Damian's talents and did not hold him responsible for the accident. Under Superman's leadership, Damian grew as a fighter but strayed further from the principals of non-lethal justice taught by Batman. Though Nightwing was gone, his **legacy would live on** in unexpected ways.
### The Gift of Nightwing
Years later after Superman's defeat, Damian was imprisoned for his role in the regime. On his birthday, he received a surprise visit from the ghost of Richard Grayson, who now calls himself Deadman. Grayson bore no ill will towards Damian, understanding the accidental nature of his demise. As a gift, Grayson bestowed upon Damian the **mantle and uniform of Nightwing,** seeing the good still left in the son of Batman. This gesture helped Damian rediscover his true calling to uphold justice without killing.
### Redemption through Nightwing
Donning the Nightwing suit inspired Damian to walk a **new path of heroism**. He worked to save others without taking lives, just as Grayson had taught him before. With Nightwing's guidance from the afterlife, Damian sought redemption for his past sins. He proved his skill and heart could be used to aid others rather than dominate them. Though he could never undo the accidental death of his friend and mentor, Damian found peace by honoring Nightwing's memory through **selfless acts of bravery and compassion.**
### Facing Deathstroke
To truly redeem himself in his father's eyes, Damian challenged Deathstroke, one of the deadliest assassins in the world, to single combat. Even weakened, Slade Wilson was a formidable foe who had bested many heroes. But Damian had been trained by the best and now fought to uphold an **ideology of non-lethal triumph over evil**. Through agility, skill and determination rather than brute force, Damian was able to defeat and disarm Deathstroke without killing him. In that moment, Batman saw that his son had learned Nightwing's most important lesson well.
### A Legacy Realized
By honoring Richard Grayson's memory and **continuing his fight for justice without killing**, Damian Wayne proved he had moved beyond his accidental role in Nightwing's death. He realized Nightwing's legacy was one of hope, redemption and peaceful triumph over darkness. Though the original Nightwing was gone, his spirit lived on through Damian. And through the son of Batman, Richard Grayson's impact on the DC world would resonate for generations to come.
