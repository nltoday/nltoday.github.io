### Handling Fever
Monitor your baby's temperature closely, especially if they have a fever. [Keep your baby cool](https://store.fi.io.vn/i-like-my-chihuahua) until the fever passes by using methods like sponging with lukewarm water, keeping the room temperature moderate, and dressing them lightly. Avoid using medication to reduce fever unless it rises above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, as fever itself helps fight the infection. Consult your pediatrician for the right approach.

### Soothe With Skin-to-Skin Contact 
Cuddling and **skin-to-skin contact** can help soothe a fussy baby with a cold. Hold your baby, chest-to-chest, for as long as they will allow. **Your body heat** will help regulate their temperature and the physical closeness provides emotional comfort. Nurse or feed whenever they seem hungry to boost their immunity.
### Use a Humidifier or Steam
Dry indoor air makes breathing difficult, especially for babies. Place a cool-mist humidifier or steamer in the baby's room to add moisture to the air. Aiming for 30-50% humidity helps loosen mucus and promotes healing. Change the water daily and clean the humidifier regularly to avoid mold growth.
### Massage With Essential Oils
For babies over 6 months, gentle massage before bedtime can relieve congestion. Mix 2-3 drops of eucalyptus, peppermint or thyme essential oil with 2 tablespoons of sweet almond or coconut oil. Gently rub it on the chest, back and feet. These oils' anti-inflammatory properties soothe symptoms when diluted and used properly. Supervise young infants closely during any essential oil use. 
### Try Saline Drops
If your pediatrician approves, use saline nose drops or a nasal aspirator to flush out nasal congestion, especially before sleeping. Saline's salt water helps loosen and drain excess mucus, making breathing easier. Suction carefully with a bulb syringe; don't insert anything into the nose. Watch for proper technique in youtube videos first.
### Opt for Natural Remedies Over Medicines
Unless fever is very high, resist the urge to treat symptoms with over-the-counter drugs meant for adults. Natural home remedies which support the immune system and provide comfort often work best for babies. Consult a doctor for the right decision in severe or persisting cases. With care, rest and supportive care, the cold will soon clear up.
### Feed Frequently and Let Them Sleep
Frequent nursing or breastmilk feeds provide antibodies, fluids and comfort to aid recovery. Allow longer periods of sleep, which boosts the immune response. Keep a healthy feeding schedule and watch for adequate wet diaper outputs. Milk feeds help fight the virus faster than any medication can.
### Use Aromatherapy Safely  
For older infants, diffusing 3-4 drops of eucalyptus, lemon or tea tree essential oil in steam or a cool mist diffuser promotes deep breathing. Make sure to use kid-safe, pure-grade oils and observe baby for any reaction. Ajwain or ajowan seeds roasted and tied in a cloth also ease congestion due to mild expectorant properties when near the crib. Avoid direct contact with the skin.
### Consult the Pediatrician for Severe Cases  
Most colds clear within a week with home care. However, see a doctor if baby seems getting worse with high fever, labored breathing or is very irritable. Antibiotics won't treat a viral infection but may be needed if it has progressed to the chest or ears. Staying hydrated, eating well and occasional medication under guidance ensure full recovery at the earliest.
