Games on Steam are offered through a variety of methods, from full paid versions to limited free access. Let's break down the different options and what they mean for your library.
### Keep Games Forever with Giveaways
Steam occasionally offers full games completely free as "giveaways." **Once added to your library, these free games are yours to keep and download forever**. For example, PayDay 2 and Left 4 Dead 2 were given away, allowing players to enjoy them at no cost long-term. This is a great opportunity to expand your collection with high-quality **titles you can access anytime in the future.**

### Time-Limited Free Access 
Some games provide temporary free access, usually for a **weekend or week-long promotional period**. These include the option to "play free this week." While you can install and play during the allotted time, the game **will not remain in your library after the trial ends.** You must purchase the full version to keep accessing it. This lets vous sample games without commitment.
### Subscription-Based Games
A smaller number of Steam titles operate on a ** paid subscription model rather than a one-time purchase.** If a game offers "free access" but requires maintaining an active subscription, you only maintain rights to play while subscribed. The moment the subscription lapses, access is revoked until renewing payment. Carefully read subscription details to understand ongoing costs.
### Free-to-Play Games 
Many online multiplayer games on Steam have switched to a "**free-to-play" model sustained by optional in-game purchases**. These games can usually be downloaded and played without restriction. However, some Story or cosmetic content remain locked behind [microtransactions](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/dog-father) for additional funds. F2P offers baseline access without commitment while allowing extra support through microtransactions. 
### DLC and Expansions
Most paid games release downloadable extra content like story Episodes, character/weapon packs, maps and so on. **These expansions require separate purchase above the base game price** to access their content in-game. Free giveaways usually include only the core game without DLC. Ensure any "free" offering specifically states if it provides expansions as well.
### Carefully Check Game Details
With so many access varieties, it pays to **carefully read all details of any "free" game offering on Steam.** Understand exactly what is provided in the free version versus expansions requiring payment later. Also note time limits and costs of ongoing access. Following these guidelines will help maximize your free and fully-owned games collection through Steam's various offers and promotions.
