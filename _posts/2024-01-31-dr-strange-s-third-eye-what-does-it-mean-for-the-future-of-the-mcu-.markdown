## The Darkhold's Corrupting Influence
Doctor Strange's decisive victory over Scarlet Witch came at a steep cost - his soul. In a desperate move to match Wanda's powers acquired from reading the Darkhold, Strange delved into the cursed tome himself. This granted him new [magical abilities](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-gamer-computer-video-game-lover-gaming-dog-chihuahua-dog) and knowledge but also left him marked. Much like the corrupted variant he possessed, Strange now has an ominous third eye, a sign of the Darkhold's corrupting influence. 
### A Warning Ignored  
In the first Doctor Strange film, Mordo warned that the bill always comes due for tampering with mystical forces beyond one's control. By reading the Darkhold, Strange has defied this warning. The book is well-known to warp the minds of its readers and transform them into villains threatening the entire **multiverse**. Strange was foolish to think he could resist its evil so easily.

### A Slippery Slope to Darkness
Strange's third eye shows he has started down a dangerous path. We've seen what became of other Darkhold readers like Scarlet Witch - their power came at the price of sanity. There is no guarantee Strange can stay in control of the darkness within him. Over time, the corrupting energy may continue to spread until he full embraces his dark side, becoming a threat greater than any the Sorcerer Supreme has faced before. 
## lingering Questions
Strange's fate remains unclear. Will he find a way to undo the Darkhold's effects before it's too late? Or has he already been irreversibly changed? His meeting with the demonic Clea at the end of MoM sparks many questions about his future character direction.
### A Fall from Grace?  
Strange's hubris in taking such a risk could be his downfall. Perhaps his third eye is just the first sign he will slowly spiral into villainy himself. Seeing a former hero corrupted would be a bold storytelling choice for the MCU. It may also create an unexpected enemy for Earth's next Sorcerer Supreme.
### Redemption or Destruction?
Then again, Strange is a skilled magic-user and perhaps the most powerful being on Earth. If anyone can resist the Darkhold, it would be him. With help from Clea and other heroes, there is still hope he can overcome the dark magic sealing his fate. But the road back from the brink of evil is long and uncertain. Only time will tell if Strange's story ends in redemption or self-destruction.
## Setting the Stage for Strange 3  
However Strange's corruption plays out, it ensures the sequel will be one of the darkest and most consequential films in the MCU yet. By the time Doctor Strange 3 arrives, he may have transformed entirely into an antagonist or remain a shaky ally at best. Either path would lead to epic showdowns that push Earth's heroes to their limits. 
### A Multiverse of Storytelling Potential
With the possibilities of the multiverse now open to the MCU, Strange's corruption also offers limitless directions the film could take. It may involve dimension-hopping travels, confrontations with evil variants, or reality-bending battles that span countless worlds. Wherever the story leads, one thing is clear - Strange's third eye has created immense potential for both him and the MCU going forward.
The fate of the Sorcerer Supreme will be one of the most captivating arcs in the MCU's future. His battle against the Darkhold's influence sets the stage for the most epic and emotionally complex Doctor Strange adventure yet.
