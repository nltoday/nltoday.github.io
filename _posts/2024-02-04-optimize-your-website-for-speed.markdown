Speed is one of the most important factors for any website. In this article, we will explore various techniques to optimize a website and deliver a faster experience for users.
## Image and Video Optimization  
### Better Formats and File Sizes
Images and videos account for a large portion of data loading on a website. [Optimizing image file formats](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/albro) like WebP and converting images to the right size can significantly reduce payload. Only including images that provide value and removing unnecessary ones helps as well. Compressing video files without losing quality is also recommended.

### Lazy Loading Images
By implementing lazy loading, images are only downloaded once they are visible within the viewport. This defers loading of images that may not be seen by the user. Libraries like LazyLoad make this easy to set up. Combined with responsive images, it ensures the right sized image is served for each view.
### Image Compression and Size Reduction  
Using tools like TinyPNG, JPEGmini or ImageOptim can help compress images without losing noticeable quality. Some free services allow bulk compression for optimization. Resizing images to only what is needed and trimming excess white/empty space can reduce their size as well.
## Code Optimization
### Code Minification and Concatenation
Minifying code removes whitespace, newlines and comments to decrease file size. Concatenating CSS and JavaScript files into single bundles means fewer HTTP requests. Using minification and concatenation tools built into frameworks or automation tools like Gulp achieves this easily.
### Reduce Requests with Bundling 
JavaScript bundles consolidate related code together to reduce duplication. Similarly CSS frameworks allow grouping styles in one file without bloat. Server-side includes (SSI) also bundle frequently used header/footer snippets into one file.
### Defer Non-critical Assets  
Deferring non-critical CSS, JavaScript and other assets until after page load allows initial render without blocking. Libraries like LoadCSS and DeferJS make defer loading simple to configure.
### Browser Caching for Repeated Assets
Files like images, CSS and JavaScript used across pages can be cached by the browser to load instantly on revisits. Setting long cache expiration headers informs caches these assets haven't changed.
## Server Optimization
### Improve Hosting Performance
Choosing a hosting provider with fast servers located near your users lowers latency. CDNs like Cloudflare provide caching, minification and HTTPS which drastically boosts page load times. 
### Database Optimization
Slow database queries bog down performance. Reviewing query efficiency, adding indexes where needed and caching query results speeds things up. NoSQL options are faster for non-relational data.
### Enable HTTP/2 Protocol
HTTP/2 allows multiplexing of requests on a single connection lowering reliance on TCP. It also supports header compression and server push which speeds up delivery of assets. 
### Leverage Browser Caching 
Setting browser caching policies for assets alongside cache control headers ensure browsers retrieve cached versions for repeat visits without unnecessary revalidation.
## System Optimization
### Use a Static Site Generator
Static site generators pre-render pages at build time so no server-side processing is needed at runtime. This results in blazing fast load times compared to traditional CMSes. Highly optimized frameworks are another good option. 
### Remove Render-Blocking Resources  
Resources like JavaScript and CSS block rendering if linked in the head. Defer or async non-critical assets so initial render isn't delayed and tracking codes at foot.
### Leverage Browser Caching Effectively  
Browser caching prevents unnecessary revalidation of unchanged assets on revisits. Leverage it well by setting optimal Cache-Control/Expiry policies for different asset types.
### Implement Service Workers
Service workers act as proxy servers sitting between web apps and the network. They enable features like offline availability, periodic updates and improved routing.
## Performance Monitoring
### Continuously Track Performance 
Tools like Google Lighthouse, WebPageTest and GTmetrix provide audits to surface issues. Integrate monitoring into workflows to catch regressions early.
### Address Top Issues Identified
Prioritize performance suggestions from audits based on potential gains. For example, optimizing critical rendering path items have high impact on speed. 
### A/B Test Optimizations
A/B test potential performance changes before launching to understand actual user impact. Metrics like page load, interaction and abandonment rates provide valuable insights.
In summary, a holistic approach across all aspects of the technical stack is needed to truly optimize website performance. The techniques discussed here aim to reduce payload and expedite delivery for an exceptional user experience. Continuously monitoring optimizations is also crucial to maintain speed over time.
