Within the first two weeks of a zombie apocalypse, society as we know it would completely collapse. Basic infrastructure and services that we rely on daily would fail one by one. As undead monsters roam the streets hunting humans, survival will depend on how well people can adapt to this new chaotic world without modern conveniences. Here is a look at what would likely happen during those initial dark fortnight.
### Lights Out
Electric grids around major population centers would fail within a matter of days without constant maintenance and management. Power stations require living operators to run properly and zombies have no understanding of complex machinery. Backup generators at critical facilities may keep the lights on temporarily but fuel will run out fast without replenishment. Within a week, [large scale power outages](https://yt.io.vn/collection/alan) would plunge urban areas into darkness permanently. Rural regions reliant on solar, wind or micro-hydro power may hold out longer. 
As power dies, so too will essential services like traffic lights, hospitals, communications networks and security systems. Without status updates, the true scale of the disaster would remain unknown. Panicked calls to overwhelmed 911 would stop answering within hours of the outbreak. Those trapped in high-rises or subways would be stranded as elevators and entrances lock down. Looting and lawlessness would spread under the cover of darkness.

### Water Works Fail
Modern water supply systems depend on a continuous **electricity-powered infrastructure**. Without power to activate treatment plants and pumping stations, potable water would rapidly become scarce. Storage tanks at elevated positions maintain water pressure through gravity flow but these have limited capacity. Most cities would see pressure falter within 3-5 days and pipes run completely dry within 2 weeks. 
With no working plumbing, sanitation becomes a top priority. Toilets will cease flushing and contaminated water may spread diseases. Boiling and purification of any remaining water sources like streams, lakes, and rain collection becomes essential for drinking. But wood and gas stoves also require fuel that is in short supply. Dehydration and waterborne illnesses would threaten survivors.
### Fuel Crisis 
Gas stations rely on electrical pumps to transfer **gasoline and diesel** from underground storage tanks to vehicles. These pumps would stop working once regional grids go down. Reservoirs hold about a week’s worth of fuel supply on average. Panic buying in the initial outbreak days would deplete stations within 2-3 days as zombies spread.  
Without fuel, generators stall and there is no transportation for supplies or evacuation. Scavenging gas directly from tanks becomes very dangerous without proper equipment. Coal, firewood, ethanol and biodiesel may provide alternatives for some engines if found but long-term fuel security is impossible. The oil infrastructure collapses within 10 days, rendering most motorized transport unusable.
### Communications Breakdown
Cell towers have backup batteries but need refueling generators which fail after roughly 48 hours without human intervention. Satellite phones may connect remotely located survivors for longer depending on available batteries or solar chargers. But signal congestion from mass calls would overload most networks within days.  
Without coordination between governments, military and disaster response teams, the crisis spirals further out of control. Isolated individuals and communities have little information about local conditions or the broader spread of the outbreak. Organized rescue or quarantine becomes virtually impossible. Mass panic and disorder ensues as the connected world abruptly ends.
### Food Insecurity
Grocery stores last 1-2 weeks at most without shipments to replenish emptied shelves as panicked buyers clear out perishables and long-life staples. Commercial farms need heavy machinery, fertilizer, fuel and manpower that rapidly disappears. Within 10 days, most survivors transition to subsistence as supplies dwindle. 
Rural areas fare better initially with backyard gardens and stockpiled canned preserves. But rotting produce in overrun fields spreads diseases while ransacked barns leave livestock to wander or be eaten. Commercial fishing and shipping halt, eliminating seafood. Malnourishment and hunger-related accidents become daily struggles. Strict rationing and foraging extends survival for some, yet starvation looms without long-term agricultural plans.
### Medical Collapse
Hospitals rapidly fill beyond capacity from both infected bites and regular injuries amid social disorder. Shortages of equipment, doctors and medications mean only the most critically wounded receive triage. Makeshift field clinics may offer limited first aid but widespread plagues flourish without mass immunizations or proper sanitation. Antibiotic stockpiles last mere weeks.
Chronic illnesses destabilize without consistent treatment. Minor wounds or infections turn fatal. Hospices and morgues become deathtraps as corpses pile up attracting zombies. Palliative care and hospice remain the only options for many as modern medicine crumbles. Survivors resort to herbal remedies and last-ditch procedures without sterilized environments or pain management.
### Security Deteriorates  
Within days, with communications down and emergency services drained, law and order fade. Police stations and military bases fall under constant attack from both infected humans and panicking survivors. Small arms and improvised weapons proliferate on the black market as people arm themselves for defense. But ammunition stores dwindle without factories.
Roving gangs form to scavenge dwindling supplies through looting and raids, bringing a new layer of chaos and violence. Territorial disputes erupt between settlements as everyone fears becoming the next victims. Checkpoints, barricades and night patrols attempt to establish control but anarchy spreads the anarchy faster than any authority can rebuild amid constant threats. Vigilantism and mob justice fill the gaps left by collapsed institutions.
Trust between survivors dwindles, yet cooperation remains essential for long term chances. While some communities band together through shared defenses, others splinter under paranoia, hunger and loss. Beyond the initial outbreak’s victims, violence and accidents claim a steady stream of lives over those desperate first two hellish weeks. Only the most resilient, adaptive and cooperative enclaves stand a hope of enduring the new post-apocalyptic normal.
