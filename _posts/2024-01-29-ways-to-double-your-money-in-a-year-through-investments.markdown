### Getting Started with Direct Equity Investment 
Direct equity investment in the stock market is one of the ways to double your money within a year. To get started, you need to open a demat account, have a laptop or computer with an internet connection, and at least Rs. 1,00,000 for investment. **Moneycontrol.com** is a good website to research companies. When selecting a stock, look for companies that are profit-making, dividend-paying, listed on both NSE and BSE, have a market price not more than 2-3 times the book value, daily average volume of over 10 lacs in NSE, current market price not less than Rs. 10 and trading within 10% of its 52-week low. Small-cap and mid-cap companies give better returns than large-cap stocks.

### Key Strategies for Direct Equity Investment
Never book a loss by selling at a loss price. Avoid fear and greed during market fluctuations. Invest money in parts at decreasing levels to average out the purchase price. Be patient and hold investments for at least a year to avail long-term capital gains tax benefits. Most stocks double from their 52-week low price within 1-2 years - small-caps within 3-6 months and mid-caps within 6-12 months. Nobody can buy at the absolute lowest and sell at the highest, but using selection criteria and gradual investment averaging strategy can optimize returns over a period.
### Intraday Trading for Higher Returns
Intraday trading allows you to reuse the same capital daily for higher returns. Stocks usually trade within +/-2% of the previous day's close. One gets opportunities to recover at least 1% from the day's low. Even earning 0.5% net daily profit after brokerage can give 122.5% annual returns. **Earning just 0.1% daily** can give 20% annual returns after taxes which is double the returns from debt investments. Reusing Rs. 1 lakh daily at 0.1%, 0.5% or 1% net daily profit can give annual profits of Rs. 20,000, Rs. 1 lakh and Rs. 2 lakhs respectively. 
### Investing in Mutual Funds
Investing in **medium-risk mutual funds** is another way to potentially double your money in a year. Choose funds from large AMCs with a good track record. A JP Morgan mutual fund investment garnered 10% interest in just one year though the second year return was less than 3%. Investing for longer periods gives better returns. Systematic investment plans (SIPs) in mutual funds help average out market fluctuations.
### Opportunities in Government Bonds and CDs
Lower risk investment options include government bonds and fixed deposits (FDs). Government bonds have assured returns and stability though the interest rates are moderate, around 6-7% annually. [Bank FDs](https://yt.io.vn/collection/ake) have interest guaranteed by banks with slightly higher interest than bonds. **CDs or Certificate of Deposits** offered by banks are for a fixed tenor like 6 months, 1 year and offer interest rates marginally higher than FDs.
### Taking Calculated Risks with Options Trading
For seasoned traders, options trading on proven stocks provides leverage and opportunity to double money with restricted risk. Options give the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset. Trading options requires in-depth understanding of **Greeks like Delta, Gamma, Vega** and strategies like covered calls, protective puts etc. to hedge risks. With options, the potential loss is limited to the premium paid but profit is unlimited depending on price movement favourability.
### Conclusion
From direct equity to mutual funds, bonds, FDs and options, varied investment options exist to potentially double money in a year based on individual risk appetite and experience. Careful stock selection, multi-level investment averaging, holding for long-term and exploring leverage through options with restricted risks can optimize returns if markets cooperate. But there are no guarantees and investment decisions need evaluation based on ongoing research and guidance from experts.
### Additional Ways to Grow Money
A few additional avenues to explore for growing money at varying risk levels include cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum which saw astronomical returns in the past when uptake increased rapidly. While returns can be massive, it is a highly unregulated and volatile asset class. Another option is **forex trading** which allows leveraging capital to traders small exchange rate movements, though it requires deep market understanding. Lastly, peer-to-peer lending platforms facilitate lending to consumers and businesses with interest paid monthly. Returns are better than savings but lending needs to be evaluated prudently factoring default risks. Overall weighing risk and returns carefully suits individual goals and risk tolerance. Diligent research and discipline remain crucial for long term success with any investment avenue.
