### Young Heroes Take Shape
The first generation of great heroes were beginning to come of age. [Thalia Grace](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-holiday-funny-santa-shetland-sheepdog-christmas-tree-2), daughter of Zeus, was born on December 22nd, 1987. Not long after, **Nico di Angelo** arrived in the world on January 28th, 1924. Of course, this date would later be retconned to 1997 for narrative purposes. Meanwhile across the Atlantic, the blood of Egyptian gods also began to stir. Carter and Sadie **Kane** entered the world in 1995 and 1997 respectively.

### A New Threat Emerges 
A little over a decade later, as the worlds of gods both Greek and Egyptian continued to intersect, a trio of heroes that would help save Western Civilization as we know it came into being. On August 18th, 1992 **Percy Jackson**, son of the sea god Poseidon, took his first breath. That same summer, **Annabeth Chase**, daughter of Athena, arrived on July 12th. The satyr protector **Grover Underwood** followed on June 5th, 1977. Unfortunately, the seeds of a terrible threat were also being sown. **Luke Castellan** was born sometime between 1985-1986.
### A New Prophecy is Made 
The early 2000s saw these heroes begin to come into their own. In the winter of 2004, a disturbing prophecy was issued that foretold a great conflict that could end in the destruction or salvation of Olympus. It named seven heroes who would play pivotal roles, including **Percy Jackson**, **Annabeth Chase**, and **Grover Underwood**. The following years would see them rise to meet this challenge, facing threats both mortal and divine. 
### A New Generation Emerges
With Western Civilization secured once more by the original heroes, a new cohort of demigods began to take the spotlight. **Jason Grace**, son of Jupiter, arrived on July 1st, 1994. That same summer, **Piper McLean** and** Leo Valdez** came into the world on June 3rd and July 7th respectively. The Roman praetor **Reyna** followed in 1993-1994. Across the sea in Asia, a powerful child of Mars named **Frank Zhang** was born in 1995. And in the Underworld, **Hazel Levesque** rejoined the living in 1927.  
### New Threats Emerge in the Modern Age
As the 2010s dawned, a period of relative peace allowed this next generation of heroes to mature. But evil was stirring once more. In 1998-1999,**Meg McCaffrey**, an impetuous but gifted daughter of Demeter, made her arrival. She would find herself embroiled in apocalyptic events unfolding in the modern world. At the same time, Norse and Egyptian myths continued to intertwine, giving rise to extraordinary figures like **Magnus Chase** (1995), **Alex Fierro** (1994-1995), and Jinn **Thomas Jefferson Jr.** (1844-1845). These warriors braved new perils that threatened all mythology.
### Legacy of Heroes Lives On
From the 1920s to the 2010s, gods and mortals alike worked to defend humanity from cosmic forces of chaos and destruction. Though every generation faced its own trials, the combined efforts of heroes from Thalia to Magnus ensured Western Civilization endured. Their legacies inspired demigods for generations to come. With new protectorates like Camp Jupiter and the Norse campsites mobilizing a united front, the future remains secured. For now, peace has been won once more across the mythological worldsâ€”but undoubtedly new heroes will be needed to answer whatever challenges arise next. The legacy of these original champions lives on.
