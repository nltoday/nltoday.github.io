Reaching out to Instagram's support team for assistance with issues on the platform is usually recommended once basic troubleshooting steps have been unsuccessful. This guide provides a detailed look at potential causes for the "Also share to feed" toggle disappearing from the "Share to Reels" section on Instagram, and recommended solutions.
### Checking App and Account Settings
The first things to check are the app version and account settings. Make sure the Instagram app is fully updated to the latest version available. Then, navigate to the account settings within the app and ensure the "Also share to feed when sharing to Reels" toggle is enabled under the "Share to Feed" option. Outdated apps or incorrect toggle settings could cause the issue.
Minor app or device-related issues are often easily resolved with basic troubleshooting methods. Force closing and restarting the Instagram app, logging out and back into the account, or even restarting the device may fix temporary glitches. These simple steps are worth trying before assuming a more complex problem.

### Considering Testing and Experiments
Instagram regularly tests new features and conducts A/B experiments on select users or devices. It's possible the disappearance of the toggle is intentional as part of a temporary experiment. However, contact with support can help determine if this is the case or identify any actions needed on the user's end. 
### Contacting Instagram Support
If the basic troubleshooting steps are unsuccessful in restoring the missing toggle, contacting Instagram support directly is advised. The Instagram Help Center provides clear instructions for submitting a request regarding "Reels" issues through their online contact form. A brief but detailed explanation of the problem along with contact details allows the support team to properly investigate and resolve the issue.
### ruling Out Device or Network Issues
Before concluding it's an app-related bug, it's worth considering whether any other device, software or network-level problems could be impacting the Instagram experience. For instance, issues with phone storage space, outdated operating systems, insecure networks or VPN configurations sometimes interfere with apps in unexpected ways. Reviewing and troubleshooting these other areas can uncover root causes not directly related to Instagram.
### Problem Persists After Troubleshooting
If all troubleshooting steps, experiments with settings and account actions, and contact with support fail to restore the missing "Also share to feed" toggle, the problem may indicate an ongoing app bug specific to certain device or account configurations. In such situations, the best approach is to keep notes on all troubleshooting tried, regularly check for app updates, and follow up periodically with support and on forums to monitor any communications about known issues or fixes being investigated by Instagram's development team. Patience and persistence are key when encountering complex problems beyond one's direct control to resolve.
### Maintaining Open Communication with Instagram  
Any persistent or recurring app issues can potentially be addressed more effectively if the user maintains open communication channels with Instagram support throughout the troubleshooting process. By providing updated information on troubleshooting status, device details, screenshots if possible and steps already completed, ongoing support cases allow representatives to investigate further or potentially flag the issue to relevant teams as a priority bug. Collaboration usually leads to the best outcomes when resolving technical problems with major platforms and services.
