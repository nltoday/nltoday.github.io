## Understanding Developers' Decisions   
Game development involves complex calculations regarding target platforms, budgets, and technical requirements. Like any business, video game companies aim to maximize profits while meeting consumer demand. 
Publishers must weigh server infrastructure costs against other development needs and marketing budgets. Maintaining dedicated servers at scale requires enormous ongoing investments that directly impact the bottom line. For massive online games, server costs could easily reach millions per month.
### Evaluating Tradeoffs
Developers consider many factors when choosing server models. **Matchmaking peer-to-peer** offloads hosting to individual machines, minimizing direct costs. However, this can degrade the player experience versus dedicated servers. 
[Hybrid models](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-doberman-pinscher-dog-pup-sleeping-v-neck-t-shirt/women&) incorporate elements of both. For example, hosting gameplay centrally but relaying matchmaking through peers. This balances costs and performance. However, developing such systems adds complexity.

### Analyzing Platform Potential   
New releases often prioritize flagship consoles, evaluating each market's **player base size and monetization opportunities**. Focusing quality efforts yields the best return. Over time, as revenue allows, additional platforms may receive dedicated servers through content updates and sequels.
## Estimating Infrastructure Demands at Scale
Hosting the hundreds of thousands concurrently online in games like Call of Duty presents immense technical and financial hurdles. Even moderate player counts demand vast server farms.
### Calculating Hardware Needs
Each concurrent user connecting to play requires computational resources. For a game hosting **300,000 daily active users**, the minimum hardware to simply facilitate gameplay could easily approach millions monthly before other costs. 
Factor in additional layers like integrated services, moderation, and maintenance, and overall multi-million dollar bills are inevitable without overwhelming player numbers or revenue streams.
### Projecting Growth Expenses
As userbase and engagement grow over a game's lifetime, so too do hosting demands. Unforeseen viral breakthroughs could spike concurrency well beyond projections, exponentially increasing unbudgeted server costs. 
Publishers aim to accommodate rising player needs profitably through careful scaling and monetization, but large-scale dedicated hosting introduces overhead risks that impact long-term viability.
## Prioritizing Profitability Against Technical Ideals   
At their cores, video games remain businesses. While dedicated servers provide a technically ideal experience for users in competitive online shooters, their costs challenge commercial viability compared to cheaper alternatives. 
Developers constantly weigh technical, financial, and consumer factors to strike a balance. With patience and support, consumer demand may eventually make dedicated servers attainable across all desired platforms and communities.
