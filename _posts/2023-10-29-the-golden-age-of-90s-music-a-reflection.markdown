Western music in the 1990s was one of the most diverse and iconic decades for popular music. Often referred to as the "golden age" of pop and rock, the 90s saw the rise of grunge, hip hop's mainstream breakthrough, and the rebirth of boy bands and bubblegum pop. Let's take a look back at some of the defining hits and genres that soundtracked the 90s.

The gritty lyrics and melodic angst of grunge struck a major chord and came to represent the era.

East Coast acts like Wu-Tang Clan and The Notorious B.I.G. brought a grittier New York flavor.

New kids on the block had paved the way in the late 80s, and colourful boy bands like Backstreet Boys and NSYNC, fueled by the growing teen pop market, achieved remarkable fame and success on a global scale. Meanwhile, women artists like Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, and Celine Dion dominated the airwaves with their massive ballads and vocal prowess. The Spice Girls also brought "Girl Power" to the mainstream.

Across the pond, Britpop bands Oasis, Blur, Pulp, and Suede dominated British rock with their melodic, Gallagher-fueled anthems. These sounds captured the post-grunge zeitgeist and brought global recognition to cool, guitar-based rock. 
### Latin Pop Crosses Over
Latin music also made major inroads, as Latin pop-rock exploded in popularity. **1990s Latin crossover artists** Stars like Enrique Iglesias blended English and Spanish lyrics over infectious beats to create the template for the Latin pop boom to come. Santana's "Supernatural" album fused Latin and African rhythms into radio-crushing rock hits. Ricky Martin's Latin-infused dance-pop brought bilingual pop to the masses and signaled a new era of inclusion.
### EDM Takes Root
The latter half of the 90s also saw the birth of modern dance and electronic music. **1990s electronic dance music genres** Pioneering DJs like The Chemical Brothers in the UK and The Prodigy on both sides of the Atlantic fused rock guitars and drums with electronic beats and samples. In clubs, genres like techno, house, drum & bass, and trip hop emerged as dominant underground dancefloor sounds. This ushered in a new synergy between rock, pop, and electronic music that has since come to define modern mainstream music.

Genres like grunge, hip hop, britpop, trip hop, latin pop, and electronic dance music all flourished and in many cases redefined popular music. Iconic artists cemented their legacies while breaking commercial and creative barriers. The decade's memorable hits continue to resonate as some of the most beloved pop anthems ever created.
