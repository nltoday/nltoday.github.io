## AlexNewtron: Creator of Roblox's Most Popular Game
The honor of creating Roblox's **first game to reach 1 billion visits** belongs to AlexNewtron for **MeepCity**.

### The Most Official Badges
The player holding the **Guinness World Record for most official Roblox badges** is scorpion67890. By taking advantage of **exploit that allowed duplicating the Bricksmith badge**, scorpion67890 managed to amass a total that surpasses even Roblox administrators and developers. While this broken badge count will never be officially recognized, it remains an interesting footnote. The only other known player to ever have more badges was skate36, but their account was banned after abusing exploits. Scorpion67890's record, even if artificially inflated, will likely stand the test of time.
