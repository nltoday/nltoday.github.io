Overcoming hurdles through determination and grit
We all face failures and setbacks in our quest for success. But it is how we get up after each fall that truly defines us. My journey of cracking the GATE exam through multiple attempts is a testament to never giving up in the face of adversity.
### Early missteps and valuable lessons 
After completing my B.Tech, I rushed into giving the GATE exam without sufficient preparation in 2013. While I managed to secure a campus placement, I realized too late that I lacked the effort needed to clear the cutoff. Lesson learned, I geared up for GATE 2014 but a new job and lack of focus lead to another unsuccessful attempt. These early stumbles taught me the importance of [focused preparation](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/akridge) and not taking the exam lightly.

### Targeting a dream job and falling short
In 2015, I finally took the exam seriously after setting my sights on jobs in Coal India. I allotted two hours daily over four months for rigorous practice and revision. While I made significant progress, it still wasn't enough to clear the eligibility criteria. Refusing to be disheartened, I vowed to keep trying until I achieved my goal.
### Turning the tide with perseverance 
Continuing to learn from past mistakes and putting in extra hours of practice, I started demonstrating consistent improvement in subsequent attempts. In 2016, after the fifth try, I finally breached the cutoff and secured admission to the prestigious IIT BHU for my Masters. The cumulative effort had paid off when it mattered the most.
### Achieving new heights at IIT BHU 
My two years at IIT BHU proved to be truly transformative. I topped exams, secured multiple job offers, and broke placement records for my department. The cherry on top was improving my GATE score substantially in 2017 despite minimal preparation. Success was sweet, yet I knew my journey had only just begun.
### Breaking into the coveted PSU sector 
Armed with the confidence and skills gained at IIT, I prepared vigorously for GATE 2018 while also completing my Masters thesis. With meticulous practice solving hundreds of problems, regular mock tests and self-analysis, I achieved new heights; interview calls from major PSUs like ONGC and selection offers followed. My perseverance had finally opened doors to a bright future.
### Never giving up and evolving as you grow
Looking back, I can see how far I have come compared to my initial stumbles. Constant self-reflection and willingness to learn from mistakes have been my guiding philosophy. My story proves that success is never out of reach - you just need to keep evolving, remain persistent through hardships and never lose sight of your goals. Years later, the journey continues to reinforce that with determination and grit, you truly can achieve anything.
