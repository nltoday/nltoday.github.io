### Why You Need a Graphics Card
Without a dedicated graphics card, your computer will rely entirely on the integrated graphics built into the CPU or motherboard to handle 3D graphics and gaming. While integrated graphics have improved in recent years, they still cannot compare to the performance of even a basic standalone graphics card. A computer without any graphics card will only be able to display 2D content and is not suitable for modern gaming.

### Evaluating Integrated HD 2000 Performance 
The Intel HD 2000 integrated graphics that come with second-generation Sandy Bridge processors from around 2011 are quite underpowered for modern gaming. Older 2D and less demanding 3D games from the early 2000s may achieve 30fps, but more advanced 3D titles will struggle tremendously. Benchmarking shows the HD 2000 is lucky to manage just 6fps on low settings in many games. Integrated graphics are best suited for basic productivity tasks and 2D applications rather than immersive [3D gaming performance](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/paw).
### A $15 Upgrade Can Make a Huge Difference
A inexpensive dedicated graphics card like the AMD Radeon HD 7570, costing around $15, can significantly boost gaming performance over onboard graphics. The extra graphics processing power and dedicated video memory allow playing games that simply won't run on integrated graphics. Entry-level discrete graphics cards provide several times more graphics horsepower, transforming an otherwise limited system into a capable 1080p gaming PC. Even a low-budget graphics card is a worthwhile upgrade for those seeking to play more recent 3D **games on a tight budget**. 
### Benefits and Limitations of eGPUs
While eGPU solutions can boost the graphical abilities of laptops and small form factor PCs, they are generally unnecessary for standard desktop computers. Desktop systems have expansion slots that support full-length graphics cards. Adding an eGPU requires a Thunderbolt port, which was uncommon on older desktop platforms like 2nd gen Intel CPUs. Performance can also be negatively impacted transferring data over Thunderbolt instead of the faster PCIe interface. For desktop gaming, an **internal graphics card** is almost always a better option than an external eGPU setup if expansion slots are available.
### Which GPU for Moderate Gaming on Haswell? 
Integrated graphics performance improved significantly with the 4th generation Haswell architecture and its HD 4000/5000 graphics. Older titles from the early 2000s can run reasonably well, with some3D graphics-intensive games from the era also playable above 30fps. For moderate PC gaming on Haswell systems, a budget GPU around the $100 price point like the AMD Radeon R7 260X provides smooth 1080p frame rates in many recent titles when paired with a Haswell CPU.While still limited, the jump in graphics from Haswell integrated to a lower mid-range ** dedicated GPU enables much more extensive gaming**.
### Conclusion
For the best gaming experience, a dedicated graphics card provides a huge leap in performance over relying solely on integrated graphics. Even entry-level discrete GPUs transform integrated-only systems into capable 1080p gaming PCs within a modest budget.Those seeking smooth gameplay should consider a graphics card, while integrated graphics suffice for light usage. With steady enhancements, modern integrated solutions can handle less demanding 3D, but a graphics card remains essential for true PC gaming.
