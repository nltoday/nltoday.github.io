## A Zealous Pharisee
Saul was born in Tarsus to devout Jewish parents who were **Pharisees**. As Pharisees, they strictly adhered to the **Law of Moses** and sought to shield their children from Gentile influences. Despite coming from a household that likely despised all things Greek, Saul was able to fluently speak both Greek and Latin. At age 13, he was sent to Jerusalem to study under the esteemed Rabbi Gamaliel, where he spent the next 5-6 years mastering Jewish history, scripture, and theology. 
## Developing His Legal Skills
After completing his studies, Saul pursued a career in **Jewish religious law**. He zealously protected and promoted strict observance of the Torah. As a rising lawyer, his goal was likely to one day join the **Sanhedrin**, the highest Jewish religious council. Saul's extreme views didn't allow for compromise on matters of faith. This legal training and devotion to orthodoxy fueled his future persecution of early Christians.
## Witnessing Christian Growth
Saul was in Jerusalem during Peter's defense before the Sanhedrin. He may have also attended the trial of Stephen, whose martyrdom he witnessed. By this time, the **Christian movement** had grown considerably in Jerusalem and throughout Judea, presenting a threat to traditional Jewish beliefs. As a loyal Pharisee, Saul saw it as his duty to quash this heresy by any means.
## A Radical Conversion
While traveling to Damascus to **arrest Christians**, Saul experienced a dramatic encounter with the risen Jesus. Struck blind, he heard a voice say "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?". His life was transformed, and he began to understand Jesus' death and resurrection in a new light. His former education now helped him vigorously defend the faith he once tried to destroy.
## Spreading the Gospel in the Greek World
As "Paul," he felt called to take the message of Christ predominantly to Gentiles. Fluent **Greek** allowed Paul to communicate effectively throughout the Roman Empire. His **theological writings** built on his rabbinic training while adapting the gospel message to Greek modes of thought. Despite persecution, Paul tirelessly planted churches from Asia Minor to Rome. His leadership and evangelism were instrumental in Christianity's spread beyond Palestine.
## A Transformational Leader and Theologian 
Paul's zeal, education, and life experiences uniquely equipped him to defend Christianity, contextualize its message for various cultures, and provide the early Church theological and structural guidance. His letters comprise a large portion of the New Testament and offer profound **insights on faith, salvation, spirituality** and living as Christians. Paul's universal vision of the gospel radically reshaped both Judaism and the nascent Christian movement. He remains one of history's most influential figures.
