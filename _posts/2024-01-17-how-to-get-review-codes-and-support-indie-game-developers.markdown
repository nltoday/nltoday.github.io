With so many video games launching every month, it can be challenging for smaller developers to get their titles in front of reviewers and publications that will help drive awareness and sales. As a reviewer, building positive relationships with developers is key to gaining early access to new releases. Here are some tips for working with indie studios to cover their games while also being transparent about the review process.
### Show your enthusiasm and track record
When contacting developers for the first time, introduce yourself and your site or publication. Provide examples of past reviews to demonstrate the quality of your work. Be enthusiastic about the developer's previous games or about the new title you want to cover. Showing sincere excitement for their games helps build trust.
Highlight any [relevant audience analytics](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-cat-gift-for-men-women-girls-boys-feline-kitten-lovers-v-neck-t-shirt/men&) like average monthly visitors or social media followers to illustrate the potential reach of your coverage. Share specific details on how you plan to promote the game through your review and what the post-release plan is. Dev teams want to know their games will get exposure to interested players.

### Offer valuable feedback during development 
Some indie studios welcome pre-release feedback to improve their titles before launch. Ask if they would value playtesting earlier builds and providing constructive critique privately. This allows you to potentially influence the game for the better while giving the developer another perspective. They may be more inclined to provide review codes long-term knowing you aim to help, not just get free games. 
### Purchase games when needed
While review codes are ideal, reality is developers have limited quantities. Let studios know you're also willing to purchase review copies as needed. Purchasing demonstrates your commitment even without a free key. Clearly disclose purchases to readers for transparency. Buying titles supports devs directly too.
### Maintain respectful communication
Be polite, professional, and respectful in all interactions. Thank developers for their consideration whether they can provide a code or not. burned
