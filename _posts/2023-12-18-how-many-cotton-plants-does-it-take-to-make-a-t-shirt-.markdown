## The Fabric Makeup of a T-Shirt
Understanding the fabric makeup is key to determining the number of cotton plants required. A typical t-shirt is made from [cotton knit fabric](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-holiday-party-this-is-my-bernard-dog-christmas-pajama-2) ranging from **150-190 grams per square meter (GSM)** in weight. Heavier fabrics above 190 GSM are less breathable for t-shirts. 
The most common t-shirt fabrics fall between **160-180 GSM**. Lighter fabrics below 160 GSM would be too thin while heavier fabrics above 180 GSM would be stiff. Within this standard GSM range, the number of t-shirts produced from 1 kilogram of fabric can vary.
### Fabric Composition
Cotton knit t-shirt fabrics are usually composed of **100% cotton** or a cotton-polyester blend. Pure cotton fabrics are more breathable and comfortable against the skin while blends are stronger, lighter, and less expensive to produce. A **65/35 cotton/polyester blend** is very common for basic tees.

### Production Efficiency
The number of t-shirts yielded from 1 kg of fabric also depends on efficient cutting and minimal fabric waste. **Minimizing excess material** through accurate pattern making and cutting is key to maximizing production rates. Typically, **8-10%** of the fabric is lost to trims and imperfect cuts.
## Yield Rates for Common T-Shirt Fabrics
Now that the key fabric factors are understood, we can examine typical yield rates for 1 kg of various t-shirt fabrics:
### 160 GSM Cotton Jersey Fabric 
A lightweight **100% cotton jersey** weighing 160 GSM can produce around **5-6 t-shirts** in sizes medium through extra large from 1 kg of fabric. Any excess pieces may increase the yield slightly.
### 170 GSM Cotton/Polyester Blend
A **65/35 cotton/polyester blend** at 170 GSM average weight produces approximately **4.5-5 t-shirts** from 1 kg of fabric after accounting for typical waste percentages. 
### 180 GSM Heavy Jersey Cotton
Heavier **180 GSM 100% cotton jersey** suitable for cold weather tees yields about **4-4.5 shirts** from 1 kg due to the denser fabric composition.
Understanding these common yield rates based on fabric type helps determine the amount of cotton needed to produce a given number of t-shirts. Let's examine this in more detail.
## Calculating the Number of Cotton Plants Required
To calculate the cotton plant requirement, we first need to determine how much fabric is needed to make an average t-shirt. Then we can trace that fabric amount back to the cotton source.
### Average T-Shirt Fabric Requirement
A medium-sized basic t-shirt averages around **150-180 grams** in weight depending on fabric density and piece specifics. Using a conservative **165 gram average**, the fabric required to make one t-shirt is **165 grams**.
### Fabric Yields and Waste Percentages 
As discussed earlier, yields and waste percentages vary by fabric:
- 160 GSM jersey cotton yields 5-6 shirts/kg with 8-10% waste 
- 170 GSM cotton/poly blend yields 4.5-5 shirts/kg with 8-10% waste
- 180 GSM heavy jersey cotton yields 4-4.5 shirts/kg with 8-10% waste
### Cotton to Fabric Ratio
It takes approximately **2.2 pounds (1 kg) of cotton** to produce **1 pound (454 grams) of greige fabric** after accounting for losses in ginning and spinning.
### Total Cotton Requirement
Now putting it all together, for a **165 gram t-shirt made from 160 GSM cotton jersey fabric**, the cotton requirement would be:
- 165 grams fabric needed per t-shirt
- Yield is 5-6 t-shirts/kg for 160 GSM cotton jersey  
- 1 kg fabric requires 2.2 lbs (1 kg) of cotton
- So 165 grams of fabric needs approximately 220 grams of cotton
Therefore, the estimated number of cotton plants required to make **one 165 gram t-shirt is approximately equal to the cotton harvested from 1-2 cotton plants**.
Of course, yields can vary in real-world production. But on average, the cotton from about **1-2 typical cotton plants** would likely suffice to supply the raw material for a single t-shirt.
## Additional Considerations
While the calculations provide a general guideline, some additional caveats are worth noting:
### Crop Variability
Cotton plant yields depend heavily on varietal genetics and local growing conditions each season. This introduces natural variability in average cotton yields per plant.
### Fiber Quality Impacts Yields  
Longer, finer cotton fibers produce higher quality fabrics but lower crop yields compared to shorter, coarser varieties. Quality considerations impact yields.
### Supply Chain Inefficiencies
Real-world textile production introduces inefficiencies beyond ideal lab conditions. Actual cotton needs factor in supply chain yields well below theoretical maximums.
### Fabric Specifications Vary
Fabric weights, fiber contents, weaves all impact yields. The above should be considered average guidelines rather than absolute rules. Actual amounts may differ by +-25%. 
With these caveats in mind, the estimate that it takes the cotton harvested from approximately 1-2 typical cotton plants to make a single average 165 gram cotton t-shirt still serves as a useful baseline for understanding cotton-to-fabric-to-garment traceability. Of course, optimizing all steps could improve these figures.
