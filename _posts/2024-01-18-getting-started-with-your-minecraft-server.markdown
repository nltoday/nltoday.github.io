### Hosting Options
There are a few different options when it comes to hosting your Minecraft server. The first question to ask is whether you want a free server or want to spend a small amount of money for better performance and features. Free servers have very limited capabilities while paid hosting provides a more enjoyable experience.
Free servers like [Aternos](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-forever-poodle-1) are great if you just want to play casually with a few friends. With Aternos, all you need is an email address to create your server. Once created, you can start the server by clicking a button and provide your friends the server name to join. The downside is free servers like Aternos have **limited RAM** which impacts performance and number of players. Over time, lag creeps in as the world generates more chunks.
For a few dollars per month, **exaroton** provides high-end on-demand servers with much better performance. Exaroton uses a credit system where you only pay for the hours your server is actually running. This flexible model means you don't waste money when nobody is online. Exaroton servers have options to adjust **RAM** and come with many useful features in their custom control panel. The sliders make it easy to optimize server settings. Overall, exaroton provides a much smoother experience compared to free options.

### Setting Up Your Server
To set up an exaroton server, you first need to purchase some credits. Credits can be bought in packages starting from $5 which should last most casual players a few months. Once purchased, go to the "Create Server" page and name your new server. The next step is important - select 2GB of RAM using the slider to keep costs low. 2GB RAM is plenty for 5-10 player maps. 
Now click "Start" to boot up the server. This may take a few minutes. Once started, you can access the live console to manage plugins, players and more. To join, open Minecraft and choose "Multiplayer" then "Direct Connect". Enter your server IP or name and hit join. Repeat the process on any friends' Minecraft clients to join your world.
With an exaroton hosted server up and running, you have access to many useful features. Live server stats show **RAM and CPU usage** so you can optimize settings over time. Automatic daily backups keep your map safe in Google Drive. Access controls let you manage operators and player permissions. Best of all, you only pay per hour used so it's affordable long term.
### Choosing a Game Mode
When first creating your server, you'll want to choose a **game mode** that suits what you and your friends enjoy most. The vanilla Minecraft game modes are Survival, Creative and Adventure. 
Survival mode is the classic gameplay where you must gather resources to craft tools, build shelter and battle monsters at night. This mode has near-infinite gameplay potential through construction projects, redstone contraptions and exploration.
Creative mode removes resource scarcity, allowing players to fly and instantly access all blocks. It's perfect for building massive projects without constraints. Many servers run a Creative world separately for construction and a Survival world for gameplay.
Adventure mode limits breaking and placement of blocks. It focuses gameplay around solving puzzles and exploring pre-built structures. This mode is well-suited for map-based servers with custom quests and challenges.
You may also want to install modpacks, plugins or datapacks to introduce new dimensions, mobs, weapons and more. Popular modpacks like **SkyFactory** totally transform the early game grind. Get creative with your friends to shape your ideal Minecraft experience!
### Growing Your Server Community 
Once your server is running smoothly, it's time to spread the word! First, share the IP address or custom domain name with your closest gaming friends on platforms like Discord. Word-of-mouth is the best way to build an initial player base.
After a few weeks, your regulars may want to invite their own friends. Consider using a simple **whitelist system** to approve new players one-by-one until you develop a friendly community. Ban any troublemakers immediately using banned player lists.
Posting your server details on public **Minecraft server lists** can expand your reach. However, always apply staff discretion when accepting newcomers at first. Have mods or admins online during peak hours to deal with any problems that arise.  
Server events and community builds keep veterans engaged while enticing newcomers. Organize mini-games, hide & seek maps, build challenges or lore-based quests for collaborative fun. Develop server traditions over time to cement your players' attachment to your shared world.
### Advanced Server Customization
Once your server stabilizes with a consistent player base, consider more complex setups. Install powerful plugins for war zones, factions, towns and economies with virtual currencies. Hundreds of plugins exist on sites like **SpigotMC** and **Bukkit** for all sorts of functions. 
Modded servers open a galaxy of new possibilities. Popular modpacks like **RLCraft** and **All The Mods** take vanilla to extraordinary new levels. Installation can seem daunting but dedicated modded servers promote their communities for years. With modpacks, the sky is your limit!
As an alternative, Fabric and Forge allow picking individual mods Ã  la carte for bespoke modpacks. Using datapacks, players can weave their own lore and quests into the default game. Resource packs let maps have distinct visual styles too.
The deepest dive is building network "hub" servers with IP forwarding between different instances, minigames, plots, mob arenas and more. For extreme customization, consider learning basic JavaScript, MySQL and server-side programming for next-level features! With patience and creativity, your Minecraft server can become an online world of its own.
