## Mega Creations, Automated Farms and More
### Mini-Games with Friends
Creating mini-games is a fun way to keep things interesting in Minecraft when you're not working on big builds. Some ideas my brother and I enjoy are **elytra obstacle courses, pixel art hide and seek,** and mystery scenarios where strange events occur that players have to figure out. We also like setting up [scavenger hunts with rare collectable items](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-matching-funny-santa-riding-shetland-sheepdog-christmas-3-2) hidden around our world. Coming up with these types of activities provides a change of pace and gets our creative juices flowing for bigger projects.

### A Massive Mob Farm
One of the largest builds I've undertaken is an automated mob farm high up in the desert biome. Starting from bedrock, I constructed a tall dark room reaching over 100 blocks into the sky. Water streams carefully directed fallen mobs into minecart collection systems underneath. Building something so vertically ambitious was a big challenge but also very rewarding to see functioning at peak efficiency. With its **industrial design optimized for high mob rates,** this farm truly felt epic in scale.
### A Guardian Temple Rising from the Seas
Another massive structure I've built is an underwater guardian temple spanning multiple oceans. Careful use of water breathing potions and night vision allowed construction of the massive coral foundations rising from the ocean floor. Luminescent glowstone and sea lanterns illuminated the monumental pillars connecting various domed chambers. Within these underwater halls, guardians spawned efficiently thanks to specialized spawning platforms. Requiring immense resources and time invested, completing this expansive temple felt like a true achievement.
### Four Cave Spider Spawners Under One Roof
My most time intensive build so far involved combining the power of four cave spider spawners discovered in very close proximity. After many design iterations, I constructed water channels and a central bubble column to efficiently collect the spiders. The complex redstone powered lighting system allows toggling the farm on and off for safe operation. Decoration with a haunted dark theme fitting the danger of cave spiders added great atmosphere. While the technical aspects provided many challenges, seeing this mega farm finally completed and producing was hugely satisfying. 
### An Automated Witch Farm
Taking advantage of a witch hut bounding a swamp biome, I designed and built an elaborate fully-automated witch farm. The multi-level construction includes portions extending over 100 blocks into the sky. Water streams guided witches into killing chambers where crimson fungi and trap doors maximized spawn rates. From there, hopper minecart collection systems transported drops into chests and filtered unwanted clutter items. The scale and complexity of this project pushed my technical skills but the rewards of endless potion ingredients make the effort quite worthwhile.
### A Thriving Iron Golem Village
For my largest villager-based project, I constructed a massive self-sufficient golem village. Surrounding walls enclose over a hundred villagers and numerous breeding, job site and golem spawn platforms. Waterways and minecart networks efficiently transport the generous iron produced throughout. Decorating the village perimeter with winding paths, gardens and fountains gave the build a lively appealing atmosphere. Though a huge investment of time and resources, the enjoyment of seeing this ambitious village thrive continues to be very satisfying.
### Future Bigger Builds
With each new megastructure I learn valuable lessons that push my skills and creativity further. Some future goals include recreating real world landmarks like the Eiffel Tower or Great Wall of China in an epic scale fitting of Minecraft. Multibiome spanning bridges and monuments also intrigue me. By continuing to challenge myself with bigger and more ambitious builds, I know my abilities will keep growing along with the size of my creations. The only limits are those we place on our own imaginations!
