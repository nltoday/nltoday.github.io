## Preparing for the Written Exam
Before starting my preparation, I sought guidance from my ISRO seniors and conducted online research to understand how to prepare for the ISRO written exam. They informed me that the exam assessed GATE syllabus along with additional subjects like **Software Engineering, Computer Graphics, Microprocessors, and Web Technologies**.  
I had given the GATE exam earlier in the year, so revising those topics was not too difficult. I then prepared the additional subjects in a superficial manner to have some background knowledge. For **Software Engineering** and **Microprocessors**, I reviewed previous GATE questions. I also referred to online sources like GeeksforGeeks and TutorialsPoint for a quick understanding of the topics. 
Importantly, my seniors mentioned that **many previous year GATE questions were directly reused** in the ISRO exam. Taking their advice seriously, I ensured revising previous year question papers at least twice with focus on the **numerical questions that could be solved quickly**. I also made it a point to thoroughly understand all theoretical questions.
## A Surprise at the Written Exam
On the exam day, I was expecting around 30% direct questions but only 3-4 came from previous papers. The rest were entirely new. This caught me off guard initially but I managed to attempt 35-40 questions in the first pass. After multiple revisions, I increased it to over 52 questions. 
However, I was unsure of crossing the 170+ marks cutoff based on last year. With partial guesses on 7-8 questions, I finished around 60 questions feeling quite dissatisfied with my performance. 
The answer key revealed I had scored over 160, safely clearing the written. But I never expected to secure a top 10 rank, which came as a huge surprisewhen the results were announced.
## Preparing for the Interview
I had around 2 months to prepare for the interview phase. Doing my homework, I focused on **5 subjects, programming languages, and 1 project** as advised by seniors. I studied **CSA, OS, DBMS, CN, TOC, C, Java** in-depth and basics of other topics. 
For favorite subjects, in-depth reading and practice problems were crucial to gainvisualization skills. Not everything from books is important - I focused on popular **GATE concepts and techniques**. Reading many candidates' experiences also helped understand what to target. 
**Network Security** knowledge proved highly beneficial. **BTech Mathematics topics like Numerical Analysis, Discrete Maths and Graph Theory** were also emphasized.
## The Interview Experience
On the D-day, I reached the guest house early to relax and revise important points. My interview was scheduled after lunch. 
It was a panel of 8-9 interviewers ranging across subjects. Initial ice-breaking questions gauged my qualifications and favorite topics. Thereafter, different interviewers probed me on varied subjects like **CSA, Networking, Instrumentation and Electronics** through almost 15 questions.
Though I couldn't recall 2 answers, I gave my best through adequate explanations and practical examples. Leaving confidently, I was selected with AIR 4 score - a proud moment for me and my family.
## Takeaways for Aspirants 
- Thoroughly prepare GATE and additional topics emphasized for ISRO 
- Consult seniors and gather necessary exam insights
- Target popular concepts over everything from books
- Strengthen favorite subjects with in-depth practice
- Maintain composure during interviews through adequate preparation
With focused preparation and believing in oneself, one can achieve dreams like becoming an ISRO scientist. I wish the best to all aspirants in their pursuit of excellence.
