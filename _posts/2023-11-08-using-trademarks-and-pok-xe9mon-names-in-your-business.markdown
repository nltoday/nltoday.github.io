### Protecting intellectual property
Businesses need to be cautious when using others' trademarks and intellectual property. **Trademarked names, characters, and logos** are the property of their owners and require permission for commercial use. Failing to do so leaves businesses open to legal risks like **cease and desist orders, lawsuits, and infringement penalties**. The smartest approach is to contact trademark holders and explore [licensing deals](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-matching-outfits-for-holiday-poodle-dog-christmas-tree-2) if interested in leveraging their brands.

### What are trademarks?  
A trademark is a type of intellectual property that distinguishes the source and quality of goods or services. Registered trademarks receive additional legal protections and rights of exclusivity for their owner's commercial use. Famous marks like Pokémon character names have achieved extensive recognition worldwide and command strong protections. As such, unlicensed adoption of another's trademarks is forbidden without permission.
### Using Pokémon names requires permission
The Pokémon franchise and all its creative works are owned by The Pokémon Company. This includes over 800 fictional Pokémon characters with unique names, types, and designs. Names serve as trademarks identifying the source and brand. As such, commercial exploitation of Pokémon names - whether registered or not - requires authorization. Simply put, businesses cannot legally name products, services, or companies after Pokémon characters without a deal. 
### Exceptions for regular words as names  
However, if a Pokémon name also happens to be a regular word with an independent meaning unrelated to the franchise, limited unlicensed use may be possible. For example, names like "Slowpoke" or "Ditto" are real words not strongly identifiable solely with Pokémon. Use of mythology-inspired names like "Golem" could also escape issues depending on contextual factors. But any adoption risks being challenged, so clearance is safest.
### Strong trademark protections for original names
For names original to and inextricably linked with Pokémon like "Pikachu" and "Charizard," protections are at their maximum. These serve as the strongest identifiers of the franchise worldwide. Any commercial use of these names - from products and services to company and domain names - would almost undoubtedly lead to enforcement action. Licensing is absolutely required to leverage the immense brand equity and recognition such trademarks command. 
### Seeking permission through licensing
The smartest path for any business interested in leveraging Pokémon or incorporating Pokémon names into their own offerings is to contact The Pokémon Company directly. Explain the planned use and scope of activities and inquire about **licensing terms and royalty structures**. A mutually agreeable deal can unlock officially authorized use while providing revenue for the IP owners. But without permission, the risks of legal battles and infringement claims loom large over any projects involving famous trademarks.
