### Conceptualizing Your Vision  
The first step is to carefully conceptualize an original game concept that draws inspiration from multiple franchises without directly copying or infringing on their intellectual properties. Developing a unique story, gameplay mechanics, and characters that incorporate familiar elements in new ways is crucial. **crafting compelling crossover experiences while respecting legal boundaries.**
Developing a comprehensive design document outlining all key aspects of the proposed game in detail will help communicate your vision and address any potential legal concerns. Clearly illustrating how the finished product will differ substantially from the source materials through new combinations and implementations is important to establish from the beginning.
