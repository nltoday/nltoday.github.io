Getting into an IIT has always been a dream for me. It was tough, but with sheer determination and guidance from phenomenal teachers, I made it a reality. Here is my journey to IIT Bombay.
##  Choosing the Right Coaching Institute
Choosing the right coaching institute is crucial for IIT preparation. After much research, I decided on [FIITJEE Punjabi Bagh](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/bulldog) as it was consistently producing top JEE ranks. I was immediately impressed by the quality of **teaching methodology** and **practice problem sessions**. My teachers **PRB sir and CAR sir**  helped develop a strong foundation and problem-solving skills. Their passion for teaching rubbed off on me and fueled my interest in physics. 
### Mastering the Basics 
In the initial months, PRB sir focused on strengthening the basics which proved invaluable later. He used innovative teaching techniques like **rap songs and skits** to make convoluted concepts digestible. His unique way of explaining formulas using **real-life analogies** cemented my understanding. CAR sir stressed on regularly solving previous year questions to gain experience. Their detailed corrections ensured I learned from my mistakes.

## Guidance from Experienced Faculty
At FIITJEE, I was guided by some of the most **experienced JEE rankers**. My chemistry teacher CAU sir made even the driest organic reactions fun to learn through his engaging lectures on **reaction mechanisms and speedy short cuts**.  For math, MAS sir not only taught formulas but also their diverse applications through high-level **context-based problems**. His assignments called '**brain openers**' were extremely challenging yet stimulating. 
### Mastering Advanced Problem Solving
In the latter months, the focus shifted to tackling intricate problems. MVKJ sir trained us to break down problems systematically using a set of **logically laid out steps**. This strengthened my analytical skills and sped up my solving ability. For physics, PBK sir resolved even the most confusing concepts with utmost clarity and patience during his **concept-heavy lectures**. PKK sir motivated us to keep practicing by setting **scoring targets** and acknowledging improvements.
## Cracking JEE Advanced
Armed with a robust understanding of concepts and honed problem-solving ability, I cleared JEE Mains with a commendable rank. To clinch a seat in IIT, I had to prepare intensively for JEE Advanced as well. My teachers boosted my preparation with specially curated **topic-wise tests and 24-hour revision plans**. With their expert guidance, self-study and more rigorous practice, I was able to crack JEE Advanced and secure admission to **IIT Bombay** to pursue my dream B.Tech course.
## Grateful for Lifelong Learning 
Looking back, I am thankful to my teachers who played a pivotal role in my IIT journey. Even after graduating from FIITJEE, they continue to motivate me through their **passion for pedagogy**. Whenever I visit Delhi, I meet PRB sir to further discuss advancements in topics like **quantum mechanics and electrodynamics**. Their selfless support has fueled my desire to keep learning. I will be forever obliged to the phenomenal faculty at FIITJEE Punjabi Bagh for helping me achieve my IIT dream.
