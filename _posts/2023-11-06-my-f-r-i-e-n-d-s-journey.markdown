### The Beginning
I first started watching F.R.I.E.N.D.S in college nearly a decade ago. All my friends were obsessed with the show and would constantly quote lines from episodes. Curiosity got the better of me and I decided to give the first season a try. From the very first episode, I was hooked. The [witty jokes](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/acklin), **relatable storylines** and most importantly, the friendship between the six main characters drew me in. It was like watching real people that I knew well.

### Becoming the "Seventh Friend"  
Over time, I watched the show obsessively. After college, I would look forward to coming home each night and catching an episode or two before bed. The characters felt like friends that were always there for me. During stressful or lonely periods, rewatching old episodes brought me comfort. It was as if I was silently living with them, an invisible "seventh friend". Whenever I had a question about life or relationships, I could always count on Monica to give me advice in her no-nonsense way. Their banter and hijinks never failed to cheer me up.
### Major Milestones
Some of the most memorable **F.R.I.E.N.D.S episodes** dealt with big life events like **marriage**, **pregnancy** and **career changes**. Watching Ross and Rachel's will-they-won't-they relationship unfold kept me on the edge of my seat. Their first kiss, breakup and subsequent drama had me laughing one moment and crying the next. Monica and Chandler's secret relationship and unconventional wedding remains one of my favorite story arcs. Each character's journey through ups and downs of adulthood felt deeply **relatable**.
### Bittersweet Endings  
All good things must come to an end though. When I reached the final season, I tried delaying it as much as possible. The **series finale** reduced me to tears as I saw the friends go their separate ways after so many years together. Even rewatches of that episode are tinged with sadness knowing there will be no more adventures to look forward to. While bittersweet, the ending provided the perfect sense of closure after 10 years with thecharacters. I took solace knowing I couldalways revisit old episodes to spend more time with my TV best friends.
### A Decade Later
It's now been close to a decade since the show ended but my love for F.R.I.E.N.D.S remains as strong as ever. In fact, I now watch re-runs even more frequently than before - at least 5-6 times a **year on repeat**. With each rewatch, I notice new jokes and subtle character moments I had previously missed. The characters still feel like old friends that I'm happy to catch up with. Their timeless dynamic never fails to transport me back to simpler times andnever fails to elicit laughter. Some things never get old like **classic sitcoms** and **unforgettable friendships**. F.R.I.E.N.D.S will always have a special place in my heart.

Even after all these years, F.R.I.E.N.D.S remains one of the most popular **1990s sitcoms**. Its **universal themes** of finding your place, navigating relationships and cherishing lifelong friendships are truly **timeless**. I'm heartened to know the joy, lessons and memories I gained from the series will be passed on for many more years to come. As Joey would say, how you doin'? F.R.I.E.N.D.S is doin' just fine!
### The One Where It Never Ends
