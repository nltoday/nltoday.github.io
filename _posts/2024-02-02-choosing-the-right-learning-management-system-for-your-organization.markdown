Learning management systems (LMS) have become an essential tool for businesses, schools, and other organizations looking to effectively deliver online training and education. However, with the wide variety of LMS options available, deciding which platform is the right fit can be challenging. This article explores important factors to consider when selecting an LMS and provides an in-depth review of the Edmingle learning platform.
### Comparing Build vs Buy Solutions
Before making a decision, it's important to weigh the pros and cons of building your own custom LMS versus purchasing a commercial off-the-shelf solution. While developing an in-house system gives you full control over features and design, it requires a significant upfront investment and ongoing maintenance costs. Commercial LMS platforms like Edmingle offer out-of-the-box functionality at a lower total cost of ownership over time. They also receive automatic updates and integrations as the platform evolves. For most organizations, a SaaS LMS provides the best balance of flexibility and affordability.
