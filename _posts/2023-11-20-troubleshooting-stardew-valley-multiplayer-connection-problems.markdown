### Ensuring Your Game is Up-to-Date
The first step is to make sure that your copy of Stardew Valley is fully updated. Click the “?” button on the bottom right corner of the title screen to check the current game version. All players must match the latest version for multiplayer to work properly. Outdated clients can cause connection issues.

### Verifying Your Game Mode and Server Settings 
If hosting, start the game using the “Co-op” option on the title screen. In the Options menu, the “Multiplayer” section should appear above “Sound.” Quit and restart if not in co-op mode. 
The **“Server Mode” setting** should be set to “Online” to allow others to connect. This option does not exist on Nintendo Switch.
### Ensuring Sufficient Player Housing
As the host, check that enough cabins have been built on the farm to house all connecting players. A minimum of one cabin is required for two players, two cabins for three players, and so on. Visit Robin to construct additional cabins if needed. 
### Launching Steam/GOG Galaxy for PC Players
On desktop, the “Enter Invite Code...” and “Invite Friend...” options will be missing if Stardew Valley cannot access your account. Ensure Steam/GOG Galaxy is open while signed into a valid profile.
### Temporarily Disabling Security Software
Try disabling anti-virus, firewalls, and any other security programs temporarily. They can block the game's online features. Set exceptions if possible instead of a full disable.
### Checking Your Console's NAT Type
Most systems have a network test that reports [NAT type](https://store.fi.io.vn/wiener-are-always-the-perfect-answer-dachshund-1). More restrictive types like "NAT3" may prevent connecting to others. Look for ways to improve your type, like port forwarding.
### Port Forwarding and DMZ Settings  
If NAT tests show limitations, forwarding ports outlined or placing your device in the DMZ may resolve connectivity issues for certain networks. Consult your router documentation for assistance.
### Rebooting Devices and Troubleshooting Last 
If issues persist, power cycle your system, modem, and router. Sometimes a fresh start helps repair glitches. Consult support if all else fails.
### Potential Steam Username Filtering
There are occasional reports of Steam display names containing prohibited language preventing connections. Try changing your name temporarily to test if this could be the cause.
### Maintaining Relationships in Stardew Valley
To enjoy multiplayer farming together, it's important to build bonds with the townsfolk. Talk to each character daily, give two gifts per week fitted to their tastes, and have beloved presents ready for their birthdays. Certain dialogue choices also boost friendship levels. Nurturing these relationships enhances the multiplayer experience.
### Comparing Games: Stardew Valley vs Graveyard Keeper
When torn between games, consider your preferred pace and gameplay style. Stardew Valley offers relaxing progression through diverse activities whereas Graveyard Keeper emphasizes grind and slow advancement through resource management. While both have their merits, Stardew Valley delivers constant progress more aligned to casual play.
### Additional Troubleshooting for Console Users  
Consoles bring additional online connection variables into play. Check for platform-specific steps:
- Nintendo Switch: Test internet connection under System Settings -> Internet to check NAT type, connection name/speeds. "NAT Type 1" is ideal for hosting.
- Xbox One: Test multiplayer connection at Support.xbox.com. Ensure ports 3074, 53, 80 are open for TCP and 88, 3074, 53, 500, 3544, 4500 for UDP. 
- PS4: Test internet under Settings -> Network -> Test Internet Connection. TCP ports 80, 443, 3478, 3479, 3480 and UDP 3478, 3479 must be open.
### Last Ditch Troubleshooting Tips
If all else fails, there are a few more things to try:
- Update device firmware and operate systems software. Outdated versions sometimes cause glitches.
- Disable any VPN or proxy services that could interfere with networking. 
- Contact your internet service provider to check for outages or configuration issues on their end. 
- Submit a support ticket as a last resort if the issue persists across all troubleshooting steps. Provide devs with logs and details to help resolve.
With patience and process of elimination, many connection woes can be overcome. Consult official game help and community forums as well for additional troubleshooting guidance. Multiplayer farming is well worth the effort!
