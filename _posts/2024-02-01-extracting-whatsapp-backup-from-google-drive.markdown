After storing your WhatsApp chats on Google Drive, the first step is to locate the backup folder. Here are the simple steps to find your WhatsApp backup folder stored on your Google Drive account:
Log into your Google Drive account from any web browser. If accessing from a mobile device, ensure you are in the desktop version of the Google Drive website. Click on the settings cogwheel and select "Manage Apps" from the menu. Scroll down the list of connected apps to locate "WhatsApp Messenger".

You can also locate backups by clicking on the storage usage number under the "Storage" option. This will show all backups including a dedicated "WhatsApp Backup" folder containing your encrypted chat history and media files.

### Limitations of Accessing Backups Directly
While locating the WhatsApp backup folder is straightforward, you cannot open or view the contents directly from Google Drive. Everything inside the backup is encrypted for security and privacy. You also cannot download the backup to access it on other devices. To read or extract content from the Google Drive backup, a third-party tool is needed.
