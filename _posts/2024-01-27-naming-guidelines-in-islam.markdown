When choosing an Islamic baby name, it's important to understand the naming etiquette and guidelines outlined in Islamic texts. Names should not imply worship or servitude of anything besides Allah, include attributes exclusive to Allah, or have meanings referring to sin or immorality. [Disliked names](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-but-psycho-bae-darling-crazy-girlfriend-t-shirt/women&) are also ones with offensive meanings that could subject the child to ridicule. 
The most beloved names according to hadith are  "**Abdullah and Abdurrahman**" as they express complete servanthood and worship of Allah. Other praised categories are names containing aspects of Allah's names and attributes, names of prophets like "**Muhammad**", righteous companions, and names with positively virtuous meanings. Considering how the name will suit the child throughout their life stages is also recommended when deciding.
### Choosing From Beloved Prophetic Names
Names of prophets are highly encouraged in Islam and **prophetic names** like Ibrahim, Musa, Isa and Nuh peace be upon them are excellent choices carrying spiritual blessings. The greatest of all prophet names is of course **Muhammad**, which means "the praised one." Variations include Ahmad and Hamid. 
Other prophet names honoring past righteous guides include Yusuf, Yaqub, Adam, Idris, Dawud, Sulayman, Zakariyya and more. Male companions of the prophet also make superb namesakes reflecting their exemplary character, with Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman and Ali amongst the most famous.
