### Fractured Relationship
M'y dad and I used to have a bad relationship during my teenage years. I would blame him for all the problems I had, wouldn't let him touch me , not even a hug thinking this is pervert(I was really stupid). Once I was like 17, my mom was hospitalized and we went to visit her. On the way back we were talking and I don't remember for what reason (it must have been silly) , I exploded and had one of those teenage histeria , without any reaction from my dad. When we got home , he bursted in tears crying and saying "why are you always angry at me , I love you and do my best for you, you're mom is probably dying and I'm the only one here for you". I don't know how, but that made like a revelation to me : why the f*** was I so stupid and angry for no reason? Why hating a man that loved you since the first day you came to this world.

### Seeking Understanding
Since then I apologized , crying as well, and our relationship got way better. We had great talks together , and I learnt so many things from him that made me what I am today. I gained a deeper **understanding of my father's love and sacrifices.** Unfortunately, two years later he died from leukemia ... And I hate myself for all the years I wasted being hateful. Our time together was cut short, but I'm grateful we were able to repair our relationship before it was too late.
### A Father's Tears
My father cried when I told him I’d been doing cocaine regularly for the past year and that I was being physically abused by the man I was living with. Out of the whole sordid situation, it was my dad’s tears that made me realize just how fucked up my world had become. I sat beside him and held him in his arms while he clutched me desperately and we cried for a long time. Then I got my shit together and vowed never to make him cry again or cause him such deep **father-child turmoil and distress.** 
### A Son's Gesture of Support  
One of the only times I've seen my dad cried (let alone partially be the cause) was back in 2008 during the peak of the financial crisis. I was only 15 or 16 at the time and the only money I saved was from doing chores around the house. I had $100 bucks or so in a giant wad of $1 and $5 bills. My dad was a software engineer and up to that point had been laid off from his job 3 or 4 times already. Finding work was impossible so he turned to a hobby of his (remodeling basements) as a last resort just to make ends meet. This didn't bring in nearly as much money as before but it was barely enough to keep the house we had and put (some) food on the table. One particular week, money was extremely scarce and I overhead my mom and dad talking about how they would pay for gas/bills/necessities/etc... for the week. So, I went to my room and went in the drawer where I kept all my money from doing chores. I opened my tiny wooden treasure chest (yes, it was in an actual mini treasure chest) in the bottom drawer and pulled out my life savings. Once I counted the money and made it all nice and neat I went to my dad, handed him my money and said “here, you take it.” At that moment I could see his eyes completely start to tear up and cry. Very reluctantly, he took the money. We hugged and he thanked me. Up until that point, I had never made my dad cry. My gesture meant to provide [financial relief and emotional support](https://yt.io.vn/collection/aliff) during their difficult time.
### Life Lessons from Dad  
Despite our ups and downs, my father taught me invaluable life lessons that have stayed with me. Through his love, discipline and guidance, he instilled in me the values of hard work, determination and compassion. Even during his frequent bouts of unemployment, he never let tough times break his spirit. He modeled grit, perseverance and unwavering optimism—traits that helped me navigate challenges in my own life. Today, I'm most grateful for the bond we were able to forge before he passed. While I deeply regret the years lost to anger and confusion as a teenager, I'm thankful our relationship healed and we found closer **emotional intimacy and understanding.** The memories and wisdom imparted by my dad continue shaping who I am.
### Facing Adversity with Grace
We all face adversity and make mistakes. The real test is how we grow from challenges. Both my father and I overcame difficult periods—addiction, abuse, financial troubles—and came out stronger on the other side. Through open communication and understanding one another's perspectives, we repaired a fractured bond. My dad faced unemployment, health issues and more with strength, optimism and grace. These qualities inspire me to face hardships with resiliency, learn from failures and appreciate life's precious moments. Most of all, his unwavering love during our lowest points reaffirmed for me the power of **forgiveness, family and facing struggles with compassion.** Our story shows that even strained relationships can heal with time, effort and a willingness to understand each other fully.
### Honoring Life's Short Gifts
My father's premature death two years after we reconciled left me with deep regret over the teenage years wasted in anger. Yet I take comfort knowing we made the most of our limited time and parted on good terms. His final lessons reminded me each day is a gift. Now when I think of my dad, I honor his memory by working to forge closer bonds with my own children. I strive to give fully of myself as a parent, accept them unconditionally and show affection every chance I get. My greatest hope is that they will cherish our relationship as much as I now cherish the one I had with my late father. Each connection and gesture of love matters because we never know when life may be cut short. I will be forever grateful for my dad's short but meaningful presence in my life and all the **precious life lessons** he imparted before he passed.
