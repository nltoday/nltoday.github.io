### Understanding Why the Relationship Ended
When a romantic relationship comes to an end, it is natural to feel hurt, confused, and disappointed. Taking time to introspect and understand what went wrong is important for closure and personal growth. **Did irreconcilable differences arise due to poor communication? Was trust broken due to unfaithfulness? Was the emotional connection lost over time?** Gaining clarity on what caused the breakup will help decide if reconnecting is a good idea.

### Assessing Your Current Emotions 
After a breakup, emotions can be raw and judgement clouded. It is crucial to wait until the initial pain subsides before making any decisions. **Ask yourself if feelings of sadness, anger or regret still linger strongly. Are you able to view your ex-partner and the relationship objectively now?** Only when the initial shock wears off and a calmer mindset returns, a rational discussion may be possible. Otherwise, reconnecting could end up reopening old wounds.
### Checking Their Mental Wellbeing 
A caring text or call to check on an ex's mental health after a breakup is understandable. **Ending a relationship can trigger feelings of loss, low self-esteem and depression.** However, the intention and impact must be carefully considered. Well-meaning gestures could backfire and give false hope if feelings are still present. It is best to leave the decision of reconnecting to the other person and respect their need for space and time to heal.
### Being Clear on Relationship Status
Before reaching out to an ex, one must be clear whether the intention is to possibly rekindle romance or simply maintain a friendly connection. **Without overtly bringing up past mistakes or hurts, have an honest discussion on where each person stands emotionally.** This creates appropriate expectations and avoids raising unwanted hopes on either side. True closure and friendship may be possible only if both feel comfortable with just being in each other's life as acquaintances now.  
### Accepting Permanence of Breakup  
Realistically accept that some relationships have run their natural course and moving on is healthier than clinging to what cannot be. **While caring enough to ensure an ex's welfare, do not get emotionally invested in hoping to reunite.** Well-wishes are better conveyed from a distance through occasional updates instead of direct interaction, especially if issues like mistrust or control still remain unresolved between people. Forcing ties where they no longer exist will preclude both from finding true fulfillment.
### Prioritizing Self-Growth
Use the post-breakup phase for self-reflection on past mistakes and personal growth instead of dwelling in regrets. **Focus energy on new hobbies, social activities and professional development.** Maintain no contact if that enables healthier detachment, and avoid comparing future prospects to the past relationship. In due course of living fully in the present, heartbreak will fade and the capacity to love again without attachment will return. This signifies true emotional maturity and readiness to meet new people.
### Summary
To summarize, checking on an ex can be well-meaning but requires care, discretion and clear intentions. Both parties must be emotionally ready, on good terms and honest about where they stand now. Closure, friendship or just accepting permanence - the decision depends on individual situations and learning from experience. Overall, prioritize moving forward in a healthy, positive way for future relationships instead of clinging to the past.
