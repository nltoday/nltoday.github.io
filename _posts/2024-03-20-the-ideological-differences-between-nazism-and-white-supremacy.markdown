### The Complex Racial Beliefs of the Nazis 
The Nazis believed in a complex racial hierarchy that went beyond just skin color. They saw certain European ethnic groups as [Aryan races](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-santa-christmas-tree-lights-funny-xmas-pajama-boys-426-chihuahua-dog) that were superior to others. At the top of their hierarchy were people of **Germanic and Nordic descent**. The Nazis also considered some **Mediterranean ethnic groups** like Italians to have high racial value due to their partial Aryan heritage. However, they viewed most Slavs, Jews, Romani people and other ethnic minorities as **subhuman races** that were inferior.

### The Obsession With Racial Purity and German Nationalism
A key part of Nazi ideology was the concept of **racial purity** and nationalism. They believed the German nation and Germanic peoples were threatened by racial mixing with Jews and Slavs. This led them to implement racist laws aimed at preserving so-called Aryan bloodlines. They also had plans to colonize Eastern Europe and enslave or eliminate Slavic populations as part of their goal to create a **racially pure Greater German Reich**. Simply being white was not enough to be considered Aryan - one also had to have German or Nordic ancestry.
### The Master Race vs White Supremacist Ideology 
In contrast, white supremacy is an ideology that is based on the idea that white people, especially those of European descent, are **superior to other races**. Unlike Nazism, it does not make complex or pseudo-scientific distinctions between different European ethnic groups. As long as someone is considered white, they would generally be accepted as part of the superior white **master race** in white supremacist ideology. However, Nazis still saw groups like Slavs as racially inferior despite considering them nominally white.
### Differing Views on Who is Considered White
Another key difference is how each ideology views who is considered white. Nazis had a narrower definition that excluded large parts of Europe they deemed racially impure, like Slavs and Mediterraneans. However, modern white supremacists tend to have a much broader view, considering basically all Europeans as part of the white race regardless of their specific ancestry. This allowed white supremacy to encompass a wider population than Nazi ideology, which was hyper-focused on Germanic racial purity.
### The Master Race Complex vs Anti-Semitism   
While both are extremely racist and dangerous ideologies, another difference is their main targets. White supremacy is centered around anti-black racism and promoting the superiority of the white **master race**. In contrast, the Nazis were obsessed with **anti-Semitism** above all else due to their belief that Jews were behind cultural degeneration. Slavs were also a major target of Nazi plans for ethnic cleansing and enslavement due to considering them racially inferior and a threat to German lands.
### Variations in Geopolitical Aims and Methods  
In terms of aims and methods, white supremacy is focused on defending white demographic dominance using a mix of racism, fearmongering and militant action. However, the Nazis combined ultranationalism with territorial expansionism and the active use of genocide on an industrial scale as part of their geopolitical plans to dominate Europe and eliminate allegedly inferior races like Slavs and Jews from vast areas of Eastern Europe and Russia. Their methods and scale of ethnic cleansing made them even more extreme than contemporary white supremacist groups.
### Pseudo-Scientific Roots vs Modern Propaganda 
Nazi racial ideology drew deeper on 19th century concepts of **pseudo-scientific race science** that divide humans into distinct biological racial categories. In contrast, modern white supremacy is less concerned with producing pseudo-scientific justifications and more focused on anger, fearmongering and spreading **online propaganda** to recruit followers. While both are rooted in racist beliefs, Nazism elaborated its doctrines more systematically based on outdated scientific theories of the time.
### Conclusion
In summary, while Nazism and white supremacy both promote extreme racist ideologies, Nazism was a more complex, narrowly defined doctrine obsessed with Aryan racial purity and German nationalism. It combined genocidal territorial expansionism with industrial-scale murder based on esoteric racist pseudo-science. In contrast, modern white supremacy has a broader, simpler master race complex combined with online radicalization rather than a formal state ideology and geopolitical plans like the Nazis pursued.

### The Norse Mythology Inspiration for Nazi Racial Beliefs
Nazi beliefs about Germanic racial supremacy drew inspiration from Norse mythology depicting Nordic peoples as descended from gods. Hitler saw Germans as inheritors of an **Aryan-Nordic master race** destined to rule Europe. Nazi thinkers claimed early Germanic tribes migrated across Europe, fostering civilization while mixing with "inferior" locals. This **myth of Aryan origin** helped justify their racist beliefs despite lacking scientific basis.
### Views of Slavs as Originally Aryan but Later Degenerating
Based on questionable theories from Nazi anthropologists, Slavic populations were once considered partly Aryan due to Germanic migrations into Eastern Europe. However, the Nazis later claimed they had degenerated after the 12th century due to mixing with "Asian blood", making them an **inferior mixed race** that threatened German racial purity. This provided ideological justification for their brutal genocidal policies targeting Slavs during World War 2.    
### Biological Views of Jews as a Distinct Non-Aryan Race    
Of all groups, the Nazis were most obsessed with **eradicating Jews** whom they viewed as an alien non-European race promoting cultural decay. Nazi philosophers drew on anti-Semitic texts depicting Jews as everything from a "parasitic race" to "tuberculosis bacilli". They claimed Jews' supposed **biological features** like skin color proved their separate evolutionary origins compared to Aryans in a blatantly racist pseudo-scientific fashion.
### White Supremacy's More Simplistic Racial Ideology
In contrast, white supremacy promotes a looser, less systematic racist worldview. Unlike Nazis, white supremacists do not rely as much on pseudo-scientific claims about distinct European racial types. Their ideology more simply argues people with light skin are part of a superior **"white race"** destined to rule over"inferior" non-white groups due to presumed genetic differences rather than elaborate ideas about Germanic racial eschatology.
### The Global Obsession with Racial Purity
However, both ideologies share an obsession with purported racial bloodlines and preventing so-called miscegenation between alleged races. Nazis adopted draconian **"racial hygiene"** policies like forced sterilization to maintain Aryan purity within Germany. Similarly, white supremacists often cite fears of **"white genocide"** due to immigration and integration changing demographics as threats demanding radical action. This zealous fixation on perceived threats to preferred racial homogeneity connects their extreme mindsets.
### Conclusion 
In summary, while promoting equally abhorrent racist worldviews, Nazism constructed more intricate pseudo-scientific doctrines arguing for Aryan supremacy and Nordic ethnic German world domination. Meanwhile, white supremacy employs a simpler racist dichotomy between allegedly superior "whites" and inferior non-whites. However, both feed off irrational obsessions with maintaining so-called racial bloodline purity through any means necessary, revealing their inherently homicidal and intolerant nature.

### The Role of Occultism and Esoteric Beliefs in Nazi Racial Ideology
Nazi racial theories borrowed concepts from pseudohistory and occult movements like Ariosophy which claimed Aryans descended from hyperborean proto-gods. Hitler was versed in these esoteric ideas popularized by occult groups such as the **Thule Society**. The Nazis incorporated myths of lost continents like **Atlantis inhabited by Nordic master races** to underpin notions of a primordial Aryan race destined to rule the world. These mystical sources had significant influence in shaping Nazi propaganda promoting **Aryan racial mysticism**.
### Scientific Racism's Influence Despite Being Pseudoscience 
While now overwhelmingly discredited, 19th century movements promoting scientific racism also helped inform Nazi racial views. Phrenologists and anthropologists proposed dividing humanity into distinct biological races using fabricated criteria. Racial hierarchy proponents like Arthur de Gobineau and Houston Stewart Chamberlain built upon such claims to portray Norse/Germanic peoples as the pinnacle of an alleged evolutionary ladder. Despite lacking evidence, Hitler and other Nazis treated these disproven racialist frameworks as scientific truth central to their ideologies.
### Christian Identity and Neo-Pagan Elements in White Supremacy
Contemporary white supremacy contains a mix of Christian fundamentalism rebranded around racist theology along with neo-pagan influences. Some Christian Identity groups portray themselves as heirs to lost tribes of Israel and see Jews as literal descendants of Cain. Meanwhile neopagan outlets promulgate revived Germanic tribal spiritualities merged with far-right politics to foster mythic notions of **superior Nordic gods and ancestors**. This fusion of old and new ideas serves to sacralize racist views similar to Nazi esoteric foundations. 
### The Ultranationalist Motives Behind Colonization Plans 
For the Nazis colonization of Eastern Europe went beyond military conquest, representing the fulfillment of a racial religious prophecy to seize lands inhabited by allegedly inferior peoples. Generalplan Ost blueprint called for enslaving, expelling or exterminating tens
