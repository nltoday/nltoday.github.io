It all started with a job change and desire to learn truck driving. Read about my experience as a driver over the past year and the insights I've gained into this important industry.
### Taking the First Steps
After resigning from my manager role at a software company, I was looking for something new. I had always been fascinated by trucks and driving so I decided to get my commercial license. However, the training process left much to be desired. I received only a brief orientation before taking the test and had to fail the first attempt before passing. My first job was with a local tipper truck, giving me valuable experience though it came with [long hours and low pay](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/dog-father). This humble beginning taught me the realities of the industry.

### Stepping Up to Bulk Transport  
Eager to learn more, I sought hazardous materials certification which opened doors to new roles. One job saw me transporting empty tankers to filling stations across four districts in South India. The **pay was better at 1300 rupees plus allowances** but it required precise handling of volatile goods. Safety had to be the top priority. Another role delivering cement and fertilizer bags proved even more lucrative, paying 7800 rupees per long distance trip. Navigating numerous checkpoints alone in a brand new truck was challenging but rewarding experience.
### Cross-Border Export Journeys
My travels then took me outside India, transporting newly built truck chassis from Chennai to the Bangladesh border for export. As a driver's assistant over four grueling days, focusing on efficient fuel use was key to maximizing our meager 1200 rupee wage. Careful planning and teamwork allowed us to save over 70 liters, proving valuable extra income. These international routes showed me the scope of the logistics industry across South Asia.
### Gaining Insights as a Coal Transporter  
Next I found work moving coal from ships to local power plants using an 18-wheeler. Earning 1200 rupees per round trip of 80km, every kilometer mattered. Small bribes to port officials and excavator operators helped maximize profits despite the **low base pay**. Observing experienced drivers also revealed techniques to bypass checkpoints illegally for faster journeys. Though lucrative, operating outside the law risked fines or worse. As a newcomer, wisely following rules remained the wisest path.
### Learning from Fellow Drivers  
Interacting with other drivers opened my eyes further. Some transported wind turbine components long distances in sophisticated European trucks. Former engineers and professionals switching to driving intrigued me. Harassment from authorities frustrated many experienced drivers, showing politics and "pilferage" plague the industry. Meeting drivers transporting 50 ton loads with care and pride made me respect their dedication. Their camaraderie and street-smarts proved invaluable for navigating challenges on the open road.
### Realizing the Hardships and Hazards  
Witnessing disrespect from other vehicles quickly cured my impatience. Slowing a loaded truck involves serious risks I'd not realized. Drivers face countless difficulties beyond mechanical faults - unreliable pay, abusive cops, unsafe stops, weeks away from families. Accidents remain an ever-present danger, able to destroy livelihoods in an instant. Most worrying of all, many choose not to pass on this life to their children. Only by experiencing these hardships firsthand did I develop true compassion for drivers' sacrifices.
### Looking Back and Looking Ahead
This past year gave me a true insider's view of India's trucking world. Complex networks move the nation's commerce yet receive little respect. While hoping to transition to a **technology role supporting drivers**, I aim promoting their welfare and dignity. All deserve fair treatment enabling pride in their essential work. may this critical industry evolve with advances like better training, infrastructure and support for those moving our economy forward each day on our highways. Safe travels to all!
