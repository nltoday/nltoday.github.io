Social media platforms introduce new features regularly to keep users engaged. However, some features also allow users to hide content from others. One such feature on Instagram is blocking other users from your story views. This can leave the blocked user wondering what happened to the content they can't see. Here are a few possible ways someone may discover if they've been blocked from seeing another user's Instagram stories.
### Asking Mutual Friends
If the blocked user and story poster share friends, asking those friends is a likely first step. For example, if Brian blocked Kurt from his story views, Kurt could ask their mutual friend Scott if he sees Brian's latest story. If Scott confirms seeing it but Kurt can't, that would indicate Kurt has likely been blocked. 
Checking with friends in this way allows the blocked user to get confirmation something is being hidden without directly confronting the person who blocked them. It's a less abrasive initial approach than directly asking the person suspected of blocking. Friends may also provide context on any recent interactions that could have led to the block.

### Comparing Views on Shared Devices 
Taking it a step further, the blocked user could ask to see the blocking person's profile from a mutual friend's device. For instance, if Kurt asked to see Scott's Instagram while they were together. If Scott can see Brian's story but Kurt cannot while looking at the same profile on Scott's phone, that provides fairly definitive confirmation of being blocked.
Observing the difference in what can be seen on a shared device versus one's own profile leaves little doubt about the blocked status. It's a more direct method than just asking a friend but avoids a potentially awkward confrontation with the person doing the blocking.
### Noticing Missing Story Highlights
Story highlights are collections of Instagram stories curated by the user to remain visible on their profile indefinitely. If a blocked user notices story highlights from the suspected blocker suddenly gone missing, that's another telltale sign. People don't usually remove all their story highlights at once for no reason. The timing of any disappearance could coincide with an interaction that led to the block.
Paying attention to any changes in highlights offers circumstantial evidence something may be awry even without direct interaction. It allows discovering a potential block through passive observation rather than confronting questioning.
### Asking the Blocking Person Directly 
As a last resort, the blocked user could choose to directly ask the person they suspect blocked them. A casual, non-confrontational message like "Hey, was wondering if for some reason I can't see your story posts lately?" allows addressing the issue without accusations. 
If the blocking person denies blocking or feigns ignorance, at least the subject has been broached. And direct communication, while potentially awkward, confirms one way or the other if a block truly occurred versus some other technical issue. It provides definitive closure even at the risk of an uncomfortable conversation.
So in summary, subtle approaches like asking friends, comparing views, or noticing missing highlights allow discovering an Instagram block without direct confrontation. But direct communication remains an option of last resort for those willing to risk an awkward exchange to get a clear answer one way or the other.
### Does it Really Matter if You're Blocked?
Upon discovery of a block, the natural reaction may be to feel embarrassed or want to confront the person responsible. However, does being blocked by someone on a social media platform truly impact you negatively?
Some experts argue it doesn't really matter in the long run. Being blocked implies the blocking person does not wish to interact with or see content from the blocked user. But if that person doesn't care about the blocker either, does their blocking action hold any significance? 
If both parties are indifferent toward each other, their social media interaction level becomes a non-issue. The blocked user still maintains full access to all other parts of the platform and their wider social network remains intact. A single blocked connection doesn't diminish their overall online presence or connectivity.
So ultimately, being blocked says more about the blocker's preferences than it does about the blocked user. As long as real-world relationships and interactions remain intact if applicable, what happens in a social media newsfeed holds little consequence. Indeed, the blocked user may even feel relieved from no longer interacting with someone they may not care about either.
So instead of dwelling on who blocked them or feeling self-conscious about it, people could choose to see being blocked as simply creating more space for other genuine relationships online and off. Maintaining perspective allows the blocked to continue enjoying social media freely rather than letting one blocked person rent valuable mental real estate.
### Should You Block Back or Confront Them?  
Once discovering the block, the natural inclination could be retaliation through blocking back or confronting the person responsible. But is reacting the best approach in most cases?
Blocking back could escalate tensions unnecessarily between two users who likely don't interact much to begin with. Retaliating often says more about one's own emotional state than the initial blocker too. It's best in many situations to rise above and remain the bigger person by not stooping to their level with a counter-block.
Likewise, confrontation usually does more harm than good after the fact. Accusations and demands for explanations won't make the block get undone and risk making an awkward situation messier. The blocker also has no obligation to justify their actions to the blocked anyways since social media relationships are casually informal. 
A polite, non-accusatory message inquiring about the reasoning could be warranted in some limited situations. Like if a close friend blocked out of the blue with no noticeable issues between you. But for distant social connections, ignoring it and moving on allows both parties to gracefully exit the exchange.
Perhaps you've both grown apart and communication naturally declined like people do with online "friends" all the time. Why force an interaction and risk further hard feelings where none previously existed? Blocking or being blocked by someone you barely interact with signals it's probably time for both of you to part digitally without conflict. 
So in many cases where the block occurred with a casual online contact versus close friend, it's healthiest to not feed the drama through retaliation or confrontation. Either block back quietly or choose the high road by ignoring it and continuing to focus social efforts where they bring you genuine fulfillment and care in return.
### Can You Prevent Being Blocked?
While getting blocked isn't necessarily the end of the world, preventing it proactively improves social media enjoyment and reduces unwanted hassles. Here are some pragmatic ways to help avoid unnecessary blocks by others:  
- [Check your behavior](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/abdallah) - Critically review how you interact and what you share. Are you prone to antagonism, oversharing private details, excessive negativity or complaints others may find draining over time? Adjusting problematic behaviors helps maintain positive connections.
- **Respect privacy** - Don't share details publicly about others shared privately with you like messages, photos or personal stories shared in confidence. This builds trust your friends can share freely without fear of overexposure.
- **Respond thoughtfully** - Take time to understand different perspectives before reacting emotionally online. Carefully consider how others may interpret your words or actions versus just intent alone. Respond instead of reacting impulsively helps maintain harmony.
- **Set boundaries** - Don't bombard others who aren't close friends with constant messages, tags or story shares. Give space so social interactions stay mutually enjoyable rather than an obligation or chore over time. 
- **Take breaks from social media** - Stepping away periodically helps you gain perspective on balanced social interactions. Come back refreshed versus constantly tapped in where fatigue or annoyance can unintentionally show overtime. 
Small adjustments to how you engage online go a long way towards preventing unnecessary blocks down the road from those you care to stay connected with most. Prevention beats reaction anytime for healthier digital relationships.
