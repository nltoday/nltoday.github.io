### Getting Started with Cross-Play
Cross-play in Minecraft refers to the ability to play together across different platforms like PC, consoles, mobile and more. The most important thing to know is that [PC players must use the Bedrock Edition](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-crazy-boston-terrier-lady-dog-lover-v-neck-t-shirt/men&) instead of the Java Edition to participate in cross-play. Bedrock Edition runs on Windows 10, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, Android and iOS so any player using one of these versions can join a world with friends regardless of the device they are using.

### Compatible Console Versions  
When it comes to consoles, Minecraft cross-play is supported between Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and mobile devices. All console editions are considered Bedrock Edition so there are no compatibility issues. Players simply need to make sure their Minecraft worlds are set to "online" instead of "LAN" or "offline" to see others across platforms. It's also important to note that **Nintendo Switch players require a Nintendo Switch Online subscription** to connect to servers and play online with friends.
### Playing Locally with Split-Screen
Split-screen is a feature that allows two or more players to share the same screen when playing locally on the same device. In Minecraft, split-screen is only supported for **Nintendo Switch and legacy console editions.** When using split-screen on Switch, only one copy of the game is needed as additional players can join the same world without purchasing another license. **Each Switch profile does not require Nintendo Switch Online** either when playing locally this way.
### Combining Cross-Play with Split-Screen
While cross-play makes it easy to join friends across devices, some players may also want the option for local multiplayer using split-screen. Thankfully, **Minecraft does support combining cross-play and split-screen play on Nintendo Switch.** This allows friends to team up whether playing online together or sharing a single screen. To set it up, launch a world on your Switch with split-screen active then have your cross-platform friends join using their respective devices as normal.
### Considerations for PC and Java Edition
When it comes to involving **PC players in cross-platform worlds, there is one important distinction - Bedrock Edition or Java Edition must be used.** Java Edition, which many veteran players know, is only compatible with other Java clients and does not support cross-play. Bedrock/Windows 10 Edition purchased through the Microsoft Store resolves this by running the same codebase as all other Bedrock platforms. Additionally, **PC players who owned Java Edition prior to 2018 were given Bedrock Edition for free but this promotion is no longer available for new players.** In summary, Bedrock Edition unlocks full cross-play support when bridging to non-PC platforms from Windows, Mac or Linux.
### Additional Tips for Smooth Gameplay
Once cross-play is set up between devices, there are a few other things players can do maximize their experience:
- Make sure all participants have a stable internet connection as latency can impact performance across different regions. 
- Adjust game settings individually for controls, sensitivity and options on each system for a tailored feel. 
- Consider features like multiplayer servers or mini-games which provide more structured cross-platform play compared to casual open worlds.
- Use communication apps simultaneously if playing without proximity chat to coordinate activities between platforms. 
Overall, Minecraft makes it very straightforward to share worlds between PC, console and mobile through cross-play. With a little preparation regarding editions and connectivity, players of all types can come together to craft, build and explore without boundaries.
