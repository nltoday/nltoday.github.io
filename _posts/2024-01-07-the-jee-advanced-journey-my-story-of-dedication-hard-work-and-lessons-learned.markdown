JEE Advanced is considered one of the toughest exams in India that tests the best of the best engineering aspirants. In this story, I recount my journey of preparing for and taking the exam across two attempts. I share my experiences, challenges faced, lessons learned and more.
### Beginning the journey
My interest in engineering stemmed from a young age. In Class 12, I scored 70 marks in JEE Advanced 2018 but wasn't fully committed in my preparation. I decided to take a drop year and enroll in a renowned coaching institute to buckle down and **give my 100% efforts to crack JEE Advanced**.

### A year of hard work pays off  
The following year, I left no stone unturned in polishing my fundamentals and practicing previous year papers relentlessly. My dedication paid rich dividends as I scored 99.1 percentile in JEE Main 2019. I also scored well in all my mock tests for JEE Advanced, scoring between 60-70% consistently. Feeling confident about my preparation, I was eager to take the final step.
### Facing the exam - Paper 1
On the examination day, I reached my exam centre well in time despite it being 50km from home. The first paper went smoothly, with most questions being doable within the given time frame. However, physics featured some tricky conceptual problems that caught me off guard initially. Luckily, I was able to solve 2 out of 4 such questions correctly. 
### Boosting confidence in Chemistry  
Where I lacked in Physics, Chemistry came to my rescue and boosted my morale. Most of the questions were direct and concept-based, allowing me to answer confidently within the time allotted. This gave me the much needed boost heading into the final section.
### Tackling a lengthier Math paper
Math has always been my favourite and strongest subject. However, the second paper featured lengthier and more intricate problems than usual. Applying all my focus and knowledge of previous year papers, I was able to solve 41 questions out of 54 within the 3 hours.
### Paper 2 - Harsher reality checks 
The trend continued in the second paper, with Physics being relatively average but Chemistry remaining problem-free. Unfortunately, Math proved to be an even bigger challenge this time around, with problems testing deeper understanding. I managed 40/54 questions in the final stretch. 
### Valuable lessons learned
Looking back, I realized consistent practice is key to score well. While I gave my best, JEE Advanced still found ways to test my limits. This experience taught me invaluable life lessons about resilience, time management and keeping an open mindset. Overall, it was a rewarding journey of self-improvement that I will cherish forever.
### Moving forward with new insights
Despite not making the JEE Advanced cutoff, I don't regret my efforts. I'm proud of how far I came in a year through grit and determination. The insights gained will help me focus on alternative career paths that are a better fit. While the IIT dream escapes me for now, I'm better equipped than before to pursue my goals.
### In conclusion
Preparing for JEE Advanced requires dedication, patience and adapting to varied challenges. While the outcome wasn't as desired, the process of repeated tests and self-evaluation has enriched me greatly. I'm grateful for this opportunity to learn and grow. My journey may have ended, but a new chapter surely awaits!
