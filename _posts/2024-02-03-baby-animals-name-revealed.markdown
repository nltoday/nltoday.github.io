### Introducing The Puggle
Did you know that the baby of an echidna is called a puggle? **Echidnas are small, spiny anteater found in Australia and New Guinea.** An adult echidna can grow up to about 50 cm long and weigh 3-5 kg. Males are generally larger than females. Puggles are about the size of a grain of rice when they are born and continue to grow in their mother's pouch for around 45 days before emerging.

### Learn the Names for Baby Hippos
Did you know that babies of hippos have their own unique names? A male adult hippo is called a bull, while a female adult hippo is known as a cow. However, a baby hippo is referred to as a calf. Female hippos give birth to a single calf that weighs between 30 to 50 kilograms. For the first few months, mother hippos keep their calves under close surveillance in the water.
### All About Hippos 
The scientific name for hippos is **Hippopotamus amphibius.** Commonly known as the common hippopotamus or Nile hippopotamus, hippos are large, semi-aquatic mammals found in Sub-Saharan Africa. They spend their days wallowing in rivers, lakes or mangrove swamps but can also travel on land in the evening in search of food. Hippos have a thick skin that helps protect them from the sun and predators. Their skin also secretes a red fluid that helps protect their skin from infections.
### Characteristics of Adult Hippos
Adult hippos are usually greyish-brown in color though their skin appears almost black when wet. Males grow up to 16 feet long and weigh up to 3,000 pounds. Females are generally smaller at around 11-13 feet long and weigh 1,500-2,000 pounds. Hippos have a huge mouth and sharp canine teeth, which they use for defense. Despite their heavy build, hippos can run up to 30 km/h over short distances usually into or out of the water. Their lifespan in the wild is around 45-50 years.
### Threats Faced By Hippos
Though hippos are massive in size, they still face threats from predators like lions, hyenas and crocodiles when calves are young. But their biggest threat comes from humans. As populations grow, their natural habitats are shrinking. Many rivers and wetlands are being degraded and polluted. Poaching is also a serious concern for hippo populations. Their ivory teeth are prized possessions by some. If proper steps are not taken, certain hippo species may become endangered soon. Conservation efforts are crucial for long-term survival of hippos in Africa.
### Conservation Status of Hippos 
There are currently three recognised species of hippos - the common hippopotamus, the pygmy hippopotamus, and the Chobe river hippopotamus. The common hippopotamus has a population of around 130,000-150,000 individuals spread across 37 African countries. They are classified as "Vulnerable" in the IUCN Red List. The pygmy hippopotamus found in West African forests has a population of only around 2,500. They are rated as "Endangered". The rare Chobe river hippopotamus has under 1,000 individuals remaining in the wild and is rated as "Endangered". Overall, more habitat protection and grassroot efforts are needed to help hippo populations thrive for generations to come.
