### A new beginning  
I still remember why I wanted to join NIFT. It was because I wanted to become a famous fashion designer and a feasible way I thought would be NIFT. Earlier I had thought of some other ways then finally zeroed here because of my creative aptitude. Each day we were learning something new about the ways and trends in the fashion industry.

### A challenging foundation year
The foundation year at NIFT was truly grueling. We were expected to complete an immense number of sheets for every assignment on varied topics like visual representation and rendering (V&R), colour theory, quilling patterns. Sleepless nights were spent trying to perfect these elaborate designs. We all wanted to give up on certain subjects like the dreaded colour chart and pixellation assignments. More often than not, our work needed to be redone, leading to immense stress and workload. However, what got me through was the sense of community among my batchmates. We faced these challenges together rather than alone. 
### Finding my people and purpose  
It was during the foundation year that I found my closest friends who I would spend the next four years with. One week into our orientation, I approached a fellow student to help me with an activity that required partnering with someone who was "overweight", like myself. Little did I know that he would become my best friend for life. I also witnessed some budding love stories during this tumultuous first year. Despite the hardships, connecting with others is what made this year memorable.
### Hectic but rewarding years ahead
The next three years at NIFT were grueling with long lectures, constant evaluations and dreaded juries. However, it did get easier with time and experience. Weekdays were filled with intensive study hours while weekends were spent desperately trying to complete assignments. Friday and Saturday evenings offered some much needed respite through socializing. Internships and graduation projects pushed our abilities and helped gain invaluable industry exposure. 
### Life after NIFT - our choices and challenges 
Graduating from NIFT opens up many possibilities - from stable 9-5 jobs to starting one's own venture. However, one has to be wary of undervaluing their skills in the job search frenzy. I regret accepting an unsuitable role in haste due to fears of unemployment. It is important to believe in one's abilities and opt for opportunities that value you. While at NIFT, we dealt with issues like politics, discrimination and sudden fee hikes. Sticking it out with my friends is what got me through the turmoil.
### Looking back with gratitude 
My years at NIFT, despite many hardships, were truly enriching. I gained profound knowledge and life skills beyond the classroom. Most importantly, I found my people - friends who supported me through thick and thin. While the education system has room for improvement, the connections and personal growth make it a cherished part of my journey. I am grateful for the experiences, both bitter and sweet, that shaped me into who I am today.
### An Alumni's advice
To future aspirants, stay focused on your goals and rely on your peers during tough times. Do not compromise on unsuitable job offers in haste. Most importantly, do not let the shortcomings of the institution undermine your self-worth and capabilities. There are alwaysh and capabilities. There are always opportunities for those who believe in themselves. I wish you the very best in pursuing your dreams and realizing your true potential.
