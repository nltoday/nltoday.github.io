## Pursuing a Commission After Graduation
One of the primary routes for women to join the Indian armed forces is to obtain a commission as an officer after completing a bachelor's degree. **Women graduates have the opportunity to apply for the Combined Defence Services exam conducted by the Union Public Service Commission.** This annual exam tests candidates on their general knowledge and reasoning ability. Those who clear the written test proceed for the Services Selection Board interview and medical examination. Based on the overall performance, women candidates may be granted admission into the Officer Training Academy at Chennai for instruction in their chosen force - the Indian Army, Navy or Air Force. 
### Commissioned Officer Roles for Women
As commissioned officers, women can specialise in a variety of **roles including signals, engineering, law, logistics and aviation**. The Indian Army recruits women officers for the Corps of Signals, Corps of Electronics and Mechanical Engineers, Army Service Corps and Judge Advocate General Branch. Meanwhile, the Indian Navy and Indian Air Force induct women officers as observers, pilots, engineers and administrators across various departments. Commissioned ranks range from Second Lieutenant to Major General. While postings are typically non-combat roles, women have the opportunity for career advancement, leadership duties and serving the nation.

## Joining Through the National Defence Academy 
Previously, entry to the National Defence Academy (NDA) - India's premier tri-service academy - was only open to men after 12th standard. However, in 2019 the government extended eligibility to women as well. ### NDA Entry for Women Graduates The NDA now accepts applications from unmarried female candidates who have completed their higher secondary education (10+2) and are in the age group 16.5-19 years. Shortlisted candidates appear for the NDA entrance exam, following which those who qualify undergo rigorous training at the NDA for three years. On graduation, they are granted commissioned ranks in the Indian Army, Navy or Air Force based on their choice and performance. ### Training and Career Prospects at NDA Successful women cadets enrolled through the NDA undergo training in various streams including science, computer science and architecture & naval construction. After the three-year integrated course and Bachelor of Science degree from the NDA, they join their allotted service branch and embark on fulfilling careers as officers.
## Applying Through University Entry Schemes
Aside from the CDS and NDA routes, the defence forces also recruit women graduates through certain university entry schemes. ### Technical Entry Scheme (TES) Eligible for BE/BTech degree holders in specified streams, the Technical Entry Scheme is a pipeline to join the Indian Air Force as Short Service Commissioned Officers in the flying branch and ground duties branch. Candidates appear for written and physical tests, followed by an interview at the Selection Center. Successful applicants are sent for training at the Air Force Academy in Hyderabad. ### University Entry Scheme (UES) For women with a Bachelor's degree in specified fields, the UES provides entry to the Indian Navy. Candidates apply and, if selected, enroll for one year Naval Orientation Course at the Indian Naval Academy in Ezhimala, Kerala. On completion, they join as Short Service Commission Officers in various branches of the Navy across India. 
## Short Service Commission Opportunities
