## GRE/GMAT, TOEFL, IELTS scores and their importance
Your standardized test scores like **GRE, GMAT, TOEFL and IELTS** play a crucial role in securing scholarships for overseas graduate studies. Universities use these scores to shortlist candidates and higher scores increase your chances of getting valuable scholarships. 
A GRE score of 315, TOEFL score of 110 and GPA of 3.83/4 are considered strong profiles that can help you get scholarships up to 10-50% of tuition fees from reputed universities in the US and Canada. Your overall academic performance also matters as you need to convince the admission committee that you deserve to be funded for your education.
### High standardized test scores open more doors
Universities first filter applications based on **GRE, GMAT, TOEFL and IELTS scores** along with GPAs. They seek out capable students most suitable for their programs. Higher standardized test takers prove their ability and commitment, making them worthwhile investment for scholarships. While minimum scores are set, crossing thresholds makes one stand out from other applicants.

### Proving financial need strengthens applications 
Scholarship providers want to support deserving candidates lacking means but having merit and potential. Explaining financial constraints and inability to fully fund education shows genuine need for assistance. Some may request evidence like bank statements. Convincingly expressing need while highlighting academic excellence helps maximize scholarship awards.
### Strong recommendations from renowned faculty boost chances
