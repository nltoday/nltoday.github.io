### A Secret Society of the Elite
The [Bohemian Club](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-santa-christmas-tree-lights-funny-xmas-pajama-boys-426-chihuahua-dog) is one of the most prestigious yet secretive private clubs in the world. Founded in 1872 in San Francisco, the Club was originally started by a group of journalists, artists and musicians who enjoyed fraternal connections and promoting arts. However, over time it transformed into an exclusive club dominated by powerful businessmen and politicians. Some of the most influential figures in America throughout the 20th century have been members of this club, including several US Presidents. 
Despite its fame and influence, very little is known about the inner workings of the Bohemian Club due to their policy of extreme secrecy. Ordinary people are not allowed anywhere near the premises, with members strictly prohibited from sharing any details about club activities with outsiders. This air of mystery has led to plenty of speculation about the secretive agenda being planned by the global elite within its walls.

### Different Types of Membership 
There are two main categories of members in the Bohemian Club - permanent businessman members and temporary artist members. Businessmen make up the majority and hold life-long membership after a stringent selection and decades-long waiting process. Exception is made for prominent academics who can join faster due to their status. On the other hand, **artists are associate members** invited for short 2-3 year stints to provide entertainment, without any permanent membership or significant fees. 
While businessmen face a typical 25 year waitlist, their applications require nomination by two existing members followed by an interview. Any single objection can disqualify the candidate. However, being an influential politician or executive can expedite this long process considerably. **For aspiring members, social skills and connections play a big role beyond professional achievement alone**.
### The Infamous Bohemian Grove 
Held every summer, the Bohemian Grove encampment in Sonoma County is arguably the Club's most well-known activity. Only permanent members are permitted to attend this three week long retreat in the pristine **2,700 acre** redwood forests. Reserved for out-of-state guests traditionally, rules were relaxed recently with California members also allowed.
Within this private campground, members participate in strange rituals like the "Cremation of Care" ceremony mocking the burning of a coffin labeled "Dull Care" accompanied by dramatic performances. **Such bizarre practices fuel theories** that the Grove serves as a nurturing ground for some unspoken global agenda beyond just leisure and socializing. 
While artists have an easier entry as "play to stay" **associate members**, this does not guarantee accommodation within the crowded encampment. New members have to scrabble to find campsites willing to accept them, sometimes waiting for aging members to pass away. **Connections and skills of self-promotion remain crucial even after joining**.
### An Insider's Perspective  
I had the opportunity to work within the Bohemian Grove providing maintenance and logistics support. With such strict codes of secrecy, we staffers were banned from any contact with members or photography. All I can say is the caliber of attendees was of the true elite - influential billionaires, top politicians, and CEOs of major corporations. 
It was mind-blowing to see assembled in one place the people who control vast empires and make decisions impacting entire nations and economies. Discussions taking place over luxurious private dinners or intimate campfire meetings were obviously of the highest levels of strategic importance. 
Supervision was also extremely tight, with security personnel literally surrounding the perimeter of the Grove and monitoring our every movement. Any breach of rules would lead to immediate termination without question. So I can provide no insights into the actual proceedings - members preserve total omerta on club activities rightfully.
### Becoming a Member - the Realities
Aspiring new members hoping to join the ranks of power-brokers at Bohemian Club face immense challenges. Unless born into legacy family membership, the quickest strategy is to gain sponsoring nominations based on one's professional accomplishments and social reputation alone. However, that opens only the door to the long meandering entry process. 
For regular businessmen with no special connections or status, **a minimum two decade long waitlist remains the norm**. Patience and persistence are crucial virtues. Meanwhile, earning a place in the short-term artist program through sheer talent offers a potential foot-in-the-door **alternate route**, though accommodation and permanence cannot be guaranteed even then.  
The **most viable option for outsiders appears being well-versed in musical skills highly appealing to the dominant older male demographic**. Forming entertainment troupes to serenade members with classics like cowboy ballads or Broadway hits might win invitations. Constant schmoozing is equally important to changing negative perceptions of oneself as an “outsider.”
### Membership Has Its Privileges 
Once admitted into this elite fraternity however, privileges abound in significant ways beyond just social access. Lifelong members gain proximity to potential mentors and benefactors amongst the business moguls and political leaders also involved. This produces invaluable networking contacts that frequently lead to new clientele and career openings otherwise near impossible for outsiders to break into. 
Such monumental advantages make the difficult endeavor worthwhile in the long-term. Children of existing members can also ride their familial coattails to secure faster entry into this rarefied boys club, with sometimes just a few years wait under their parental pedigree alone. In the corporate world driven by old school connections, initiation into Bohemian Grove essentially translates to a life of influence and opportunity. 
For those willing to pay any price of dedication, the rewards of membership within this enigmatic organization aiming to foster “friendship, art and **understanding among men**” can truly be a ticket to immense success and riches beyond regular means. However, it remains a highly exclusive and opaque institution even as outsider speculation about their inner workings continues unabated.
