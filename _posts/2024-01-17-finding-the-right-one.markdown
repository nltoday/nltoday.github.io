## What Does Your Heart Say?
Most people believe that listening to your heart is important when it comes to finding the right partner. To some extent, this seems true - our emotions and feelings obviously play a large role. However, relying solely on feelings can also lead us astray. While the heart may fly for irrational reasons in the early stages due to hormones like [adrenaline](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-santa-christmas-tree-lights-funny-xmas-pajama-boys-426-chihuahua-dog), **oxytocin**, and **dopamine**, this initial attraction is not always indicative of a sustainable long-term relationship.
### Give It Time
Time is needed to see past surface level emotions and truly get to know someone. Their true nature, character, and priorities may not be immediately apparent. Only with time can you understand how they handle conflicts, what kind of language they use during disagreements, and whether they treat others, including you, with kindness and respect. As those initial feelings fade, you can start to see clearly if this person is right for you in the long run. It's important to let your body and mind adjust to being with them before making any definitive decisions.

## Reflecting Inward 
In addition to observing your potential partner's behaviors over time, self-reflection is also key to discerning whether someone is a good match. Ask yourself important questions about how the relationship makes you feel emotionally and mentally.
### How Do You Feel?
Does spending time with this person leave you feeling energized, happy, and good about yourself? Or do you instead feel drained, stressed, or unheard? A healthy relationship should boost your self-esteem and general well-being. If over time you mainly experience negative emotions, it may not be the healthiest situation.
### Shared Values and Priorities 
Do you and your potential partner's important life goals and priorities align? Do they understand and care about the issues that matter most to you? Or are your core values fundamentally different? Finding someone who shares or at least respects your perspective on big topics like family, career, lifestyle, politics, and worldviews will help ensure long-term compatibility.
## Observing Both Sides
When evaluating whether someone could be a life partner, it's not enough to focus only on how the relationship makes you feel or if your needs are being met. A reciprocal dynamic where both people's needs are considered is most conducive to a stable marriage or long-term relationship.
### Do You Respect Them?
Are you able to see things from their point of view with empathy and understanding? Do you make an effort to get to know them on a deep level, including their dreams, flaws, and past experiences? Respect is key for valuing someone fully as an individual separate from yourself. 
### Bringing Out the Best in Each Other  
An ideal relationship transforms both people to be better versions of themselves. Do you naturally want to uplift their spirits and support their personal growth? In what ways do they motivate you to keep improving too? Look for a balanced dynamic where both individuals positively impact the other's development.
### Meeting Halfway
While still being true to yourself, are you willing to compromise when needed to find middle ground? Do you prioritize teamwork and cooperation over being right? Successful partnerships require flexibility from both sides to find solutions both feel good about.
## Red Flags to Watch For
While attraction and emotions are important factors, certain behavioral tendencies can indicate deeper incompatibility or toxicity. Pay close attention to how a potential partner handles stress, disagreements, or difficult life periods. Some concerning signs include:
### Unstable Emotions
Dramatic mood swings, unpredictable outbursts, inability to regulate emotions in a healthy way. Being with someone who makes you constantly walk on eggshells will drain your energy.
### Manipulation
Covert control tactics, guilt trips, gaslighting meant to distort reality and questioning your judgment or perceptions. Their needs always come before respecting your boundaries. 
### Lack of Accountability 
Blaming others for their mistakes, refusing to take responsibility for hurtful actions even after multiple chances. Growth requires being able to self-reflect with humility.
### Self-Absorption
Only caring about their wants and issues without being emotionally available or supportive for your struggles. The relationship feels one-sided rather than a true partnership. 
Being aware of red flags early allows you to ditch potentially toxic dynamics before becoming too deeply emotionally entangled. While no one is perfect, prioritizing kindness, stability and balance in a relationship leads to healthier long-term bonds.
## Making an Informed Decision 
Weighing all factors consciously over an appropriate adjustment period provides clarity on whether someone has potential as a life partner or not. Asking tough questions of both yourself and the other individual results in informed conclusions, as opposed to following temporary feelings alone. Taking the time for thorough consideration leads to sound decisions aligning with your core needs and relationship expectations.
The right person for you enhances your life rather than dragging you down. With patience and self-awareness, you can discern if they truly make you a better version of yourself that you're able to become. But ultimately, a life partner is someone you want to grow _with_ - as equals supporting each other to constantly evolve into your best selves through both good and challenging times. Where there is mutual care, respect, compromise and personal betterment, the foundation for a healthy lifelong bond can be built.
