### [Steam verification can block cracked copies](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/chihuahua-dog)
Steam has robust verification mechanisms to ensure only legitimate copies of games can access its servers and play online. When trying to play a cracked game over a local network (LAN) or online, Steam will try to verify the game licence is associated with a real Steam account. However, since cracked copies bypass the normal purchasing and activation process, Steam is unable to validate the game and will block access to its servers. This prevents botched or pirated versions from playing online multiplayer games through Steam.

### **Game developers can add additional restrictions** 
Beyond Steam's baseline verification, individual game developers also have flexibility to include further restrictions in their titles. Some games may tightly integrate Steam authentication and blocking measures, making it very difficult for unauthorized versions to interact over a network at all. Others may integrate Steam's protections but also permit limited LAN-only play between cracked copies as a compromise. This level of variation means there is no single answer - it truly depends on the specific game as to what level of LAN or online functionality a cracked copy might provide.
### **Third-party programs can sometimes facilitate LAN play**
For games with looser or absent digital rights management, alternative programs not tied directly to Steam may still enable **LAN multiplayer between non-legitimate copies**. Services like Hamachi create virtual private networks that mimic a local area connection between computers on disparate networks. By essentially tricking games into thinking the separate PCs are on the same internal network, programs like Hamachi sometimes facilitate LAN-style play between pirated versions where Steam verification and the game's own protections have been bypassed. However, results will differ per title.
### **Testing is required to determine crack's capabilities**  
Given the variation in how individual game developers implement DRM and online features, the only way to truly know what level of functionality a particular cracked game copy provides is to test it directly. Two non-legitimate copies of the same game title may behave quite differently depending on when and how their crack was produced. Performance over LAN versus online play also cannot be assumed - one method might work where another does not. With testing, players can determine the real limits of multiplayer for that specific unauthorized version. But there are no guarantees of what level of network interactivity may be possible.
### **Legal and ethical issues to consider**
While examining the technical feasibility of LAN or online play with cracked games is an interesting technical question, broader legal and ethical issues still apply. Distributing or using unauthorized game copies circumvents the normal commercial transaction between developer and customer and deprives creators of fair compensation. Some jurisdictions may also consider certain usages or distributions of pirated software as criminal acts. From a harm reduction perspective, the surest approach is to only run legally acquired software titles obtained through official distribution avenues. Nonetheless, the capabilities of individual game cracks remains an intriguing technical discussion separate from such considerations.
### **Official online play requires authentic game copies**  
In summary, while limited LAN functionality may sometimes be feasible between cracked game versions through programs like Hamachi, authentic online multiplayer through official game servers generally demands legitimate licensed copies verified through services such as Steam. Developers incorporate protections precisely because unauthorized distribution harms their business. The degree to which workarounds succeed varies per title and situation. But for completely reliable online play according to a game's intended design, purchasing authentic versions direct from publishers is the only way to guarantee compatibility as intended by creators.
### **Testing is the only way to evaluate crack limitations**
For anyone curious about the precise limitations of a specific pirated game copy, direct testing remains the sole method. Two factors above all others impact what's possible - the DRM and authentication schemes built into the game by its developers, as well as any modifications made by the crack itself. Generalizations don't apply because approaches differ widely. Examining functionality over LAN versus the public internet may also yield dissimilar results. Only hands-on exploration can characterize the real capabilities and constraints for that one unauthorized version in question. Interesting as speculation about worked or unworked methods may be, experimentation offers the surest perspective on a given crack's true colors.
### Conclusion
In closing, while alternative programs sometimes allow limited LAN play between pirated games, official online services like Steam are designed only for authenticated licensed copies as intended by publishers. The degree to which connectivity is blocked varies significantly by individual title and how its developers tailored verification. Curiosity about cracks is understandable from a technical viewpoint alone. But broader ethical issues still stand, making purchase of legitimate versions the only foolproof approach for full intended gameplay online and support of ongoing development. In any event, would-be players have no choice but to test cracks directly case by case to judge real-world function over various network types for any unauthorized version in question. General rules simply do not apply across every possible situation.
