### Beauty, Culture and Challenges 
I have been fortunate to travel to over 60 countries throughout my life. Each place offered new experiences that have helped shape my worldview. Some destinations like **Norway's Trolltunga cliff**, **Iceland's otherworldly landscapes**, and **Portugal's historic Castelo dos Mouros** showcased breathtaking natural beauty and rich culture. However, returning to my family's homeland of Somalia unveiled deeper challenges.
While the sights in Western countries enthralled me, visiting Somalia highlighted the sexism ingrained in some societies. As a woman who grew up abroad, the constant stares and judgments I faced were difficult to endure. Comments about my unmarried status and lack of female genital mutilation cut deeply. Such archaic traditions contradicted the progressive values I hold. Though Somalia is part of my heritage, witnessing its treatment of women firsthand solidified that I do not wish to return. 
Contrastly, my recent trip to China showcased a vibrant modern culture full of historical landmarks. The [pollution issues](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/aliff) in major cities are a concern but efforts are being made to improve air quality. I was in awe of iconic sites like the **Great Wall, Forbidden City** and **Summer Palace**. As a child at heart, I also loved exploring **Shanghai Disneyland**! The Chinese people's warmth and delicious cuisine made me feel very welcome. China proved itself to be a country with deep roots yet open to change - a balance some societies still struggle to find.

### Natural Wonders that Take Your Breath Away
Norway continues to captivate me with its raw natural beauty. Hiking to **Trolltunga cliff** and peering 700 meters over the edge left me breathless, both literally and figuratively. Gazing out at the stunning Norwegian landscape, it felt as if I was suspended between land and sky. Equally impressive were Iceland's diverse **geothermal areas, waterfalls and glaciers**. Whether bathed in summer sun or winter snow, Iceland's untamed terrain leaves an indelible mark. Sweden's **Ice Hotel**, built entirely of ice each winter, also ignited my imagination with its chilly artistic displays. The creativity used to designs such ephemeral architecture was truly inspiring. 
Portugal possessed a charm all its own through historical sites like **Castelo dos Mouros** perched upon a hill. Wandering its stone passages transported me back to Medieval times. In Myanmar, the mystique of the **Bagan Plain's over 2,000 ancient temples** dating to the 9th-13th centuries gave me goosebumps. Peering at the structures sitting among farm fields and forest was surreal. Even glimpsing daily life outside a metro station in secretive North Korea held an eerie fascination. Each destination offered perspective into cultures through their prized landmarks and locally cherished places.
### Sacred Sites and the Human Connection
Two religious landmarks that left a strong impression were Bhutan's iconic **Tiger's Nest monastery** and the awe-inspiring **Machu Picchu** citadel in Peru. Trekking to Tiger's Nest clinging to the mountainside made the solitary pilgrimage that monks endure feel tangible. In Machu Picchu, it was easy to imagine the Incas going about their daily rituals high amongst the Andes mountains centuries ago. 
While many destinations awe with natural or architectural beauty, it is through meeting locals that I truly gain understanding. In Myanmar, chatting with farmers in the countryside gave insight into their resilient spirit despite challenges. Friends made along China's waterways reminded me of our shared humanity beyond outward differences. Even in restrictive North Korea, fleeting smiles from passersby communicated more than any propaganda. These brief yet meaningful connections reinforce that community is what uplifts civilizations - not borders or ideologies alone. Travel expands our borders physically and mentally ideologies alone. Travel expands our borders physically and mentally, a gift I am thankful for each day.
### Continuing My Journey with Gratitude 
Looking back, I feel incredibly fortunate for all the places, people and lessons encountered over a lifetime of travel. While some destinations like Somalia hold complex memories, each adds richness and nuance to how I view the world. There is so much more to experience, and I hope to one day visit destinations like **Peru's Machu Picchu**, **Morocco's cultural melting pot** and **South Africa's unparalleled natural parks**. I am also eager to return to favorites like Norway to witness its **Northern Lights** and Iceland for another **spectacular eruption**. Wherever the future may lead, I aim to approach each new place with humility, openness and gratitude for the inspiring diversity our planet holds. My travels have shown that while cultural differences abound, our shared humanity runs far deeper.
