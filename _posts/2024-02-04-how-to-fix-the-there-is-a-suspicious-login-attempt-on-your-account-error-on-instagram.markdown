## Getting Locked Out of Your Instagram Account
We've all experienced the frustration of being locked out of an important online account. Whether it's our email, bank account, social media, or more - not being able to access what's ours can be really stressful. 
One common issue many Instagram users run into is the "There is a suspicious login attempt on your account" error. This article will go through the most common reasons this might happen, and provide steps to help you regain access to your Instagram account.
### [Checking for Suspicious Activity](https://yt.io.vn/collection/aliff)
The first thing to do when seeing this error is to check for any suspicious activity on your account. Log into your email associated with Instagram and look for any emails you don't recognize, from Instagram or otherwise. Pay close attention to the subject line and sender - phishing emails can look very similar to real ones. 
Check your Instagram login history as well for devices you don't recognize. If you see logins from other countries or unfamiliar places, it's possible your account has been compromised. Change your Instagram password immediately using a new, unique password if you notice any odd activity.

### **Confirming Login Attempts**  
One of the most common causes of this error is deactivating your Instagram account and then trying to log back in. When you deactivate, Instagram marks your account as "inactive" but still valid. Then when you try logging in again later, it sees this as a suspicious new login from a device it doesn't recognize on an inactive account.
To resolve it, the best first step is to confirm the login is really you. Go into your Instagram app and check for a prompt asking if a login was really you. Select yes to confirm and bypass the suspicious activity check. If you don't see the prompt, wait a full day and try logging in again.
### **Entering Verification Codes Correctly**
Another common issue is inputting verification codes incorrectly when logging in. Instagram sends these codes as an extra security step whenever it sees suspicious activity to confirm your identity. But if you make too many mistakes entering the codes, it assumes something fishy is going on and locks you out for a period of time. 
Be sure to double check the codes are entered correctly, without any typos. You can also try clearing your browsing data and cache or using a different device to log in, as saved logins can sometimes cause issues accepting the verification code. Just be patient, and it should allow you to log in successfully after a few attempts.
### **Waiting for Instagram to Reset Security Flags** 
In some difficult cases, you may need to give Instagram time to fully reset any suspicious activity flags on your account. This happens if there were actual multiple failed login attempts from unknown devices before you realized your account was compromised.
While frustrating, the best approach here is extreme patience. Try logging in again after a full 24 hours, and then once more a few days later. Instagram maintains logs of account activity over time, and may need a full reset cycle to feel confident letting you back in without risk of further harm. As long as you're entering the correct verification codes, it should eventually remove all blocks.
## Common Reasons for Login Errors and Solutions 
By now, covering the main typical causes of the "suspicious login attempt" error message provides helpful insights. Let's summarize the key points before diving into additional tips:
### **Inactive Account Logins**
Deactivating then reactivating your account too quickly can trigger this error until you confirm the login attempt. Wait a full day before trying again if possible.
### **Incorrect Verification Codes** 
Too many wrong code entries raises red flags - double check codes are correct and try different devices if issues persist accepting valid codes. 
### **Compromised Account Activity**
Actual suspicious logins from unknown places may require longer waits of 24+ hours for Instagram to fully reset security measures. Monitor account emails and login locations for any unusual activity.
### **Cache, History, Cookie Clearing**
Try clearing browser data, history, cookies - sometimes old login instances cause interference accepting new codes on the same device.
Beyond those main reasons, here are a few additional tips that may help fix the suspicious login attempt error:
## Fixing Login Errors through Additional Steps
### **Use Request Login Review** 
Within Instagram's settings, there's an option to "Request Login Review" which alerts Instagram support staff your account may have been hacked. They'll investigate and help remove any blocks faster.
### **Contact Instagram Support Directly**
As a last resort, explain your issue in detail to an Instagram representative by email or chat. They have tools to manually override security locks in some cases.
### **Wait and Try a New Device**  
Often issues clear up on their own within a day or so. Switching to a completely separate device/network for logins can bypass any device-specific errors as well. 
### **Update Your App and OS**
Outdated versions of Instagram apps and phone operating systems can cause authentication glitches. Ensure both are fully up to date before troubleshooting logins.
### **Change Associated Email Password**
If account was hacked, change the email password too as hackers may still access account recovery options otherwise even after resets. 
With patience and by methodically working through these steps, you should eventually be able to regain access to your Instagram account after hitting the suspicious login roadblock. Let me know if any part needs more explanation!
