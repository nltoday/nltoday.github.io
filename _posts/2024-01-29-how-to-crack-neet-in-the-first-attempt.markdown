Stick to your timetable religiously and divide subjects into small portions that can be completed each day. Take regular breaks in between to avoid fatigue. Keep revising topics covered earlier along with covering new ones as per the schedule. This will help you finish your syllabus on time and in an **organized manner.**
### Thoroughly Revise NCERT 
Majority of the questions in NEET biology section are directly asked from NCERT textbooks. **Thorough knowledge of all diagrams, flow charts and case studies provided in NCERT is a must.** Revise each chapter at least twice - once after completing and then again before exams.  Do not mug up or force yourself to study beyond capacity. Take regular short tests from NCERT to assess your preparation level. Correct your mistakes to improve conceptual clarity.
### Practice from Previous Year Question Papers
Previous year question papers are a goldmine of information on important topics consistently asked over the years. Analyzing **PYQs gives you an idea about high-yield topics to focus more on.** Attempting 10-15 full tests under exam conditions helps you evaluate your speed and accuracy. Analyze your performance to identify weak areas. Consulting solution PDFs also help understand rationales, tips and alternative methods to solve different types of questions. This is one of the most effective ways to boost exam confidence and time-management skills.
### Solve Questions Following the Standards

Discuss questions with peers and teachers to clear doubts. Refer to standard books like MTG, Arihant or previous year paper solutions to check alternative approaches. With regular self-assessment tests, gradually increase your question-solving speed along with maintaining accuracy over 95%.
### Clear Basic Concepts Thoroughly 
For subjects like physics and chemistry, focus on **clearing fundamental concepts over a wide range of topics rather than diving deep into select few.** Try to understand basics intuitively through examples and diagrams instead of relying on rote learning.  Revisit core concepts regularly to retain clarity. Attempting numerical problems is a must to test your understanding and boost problem-solving ability for application-based questions. Clear doubts without delay from reliable sources like teachers or study material videos.
### Take Regular Subject-Wise Mock Tests
Including full-length subject-wise mock tests as part of your preparation is necessary to practice under exam conditions. Identify weak areas that need more work based on analyses of previous mock performances. Taking one subject-wise full mock once a week is recommended. This also helps to address test anxiety issues and boost confidence. Make sure to allot exact exam duration and avoid distraction while attempting the test. Analyze answers to improve for the next round of mock tests.
### Stay Positive and Focused
Preparation for any competitive exam can become tedious involving endless hours of study. **Maintaining a positive mindset and refraining from comparing progress with others is important during this phase.** Take short breaks for entertainment like music, walking etc. to refresh yourself.Staying motivated with achievable daily/weekly goals instills confidence in one's preparation. Follow a nutritious diet and get enough sleep to keep stress levels in check. Believe in your ability to crack the exam in the first attempt through disciplined efforts over the next few months.
