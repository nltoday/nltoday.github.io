## Category-wise analysis  
The JEE Main application form allows candidates to specify their category as general, OBC, SC, ST or PwD. Analyzing the data **based on social categories** provides insights. 
### Reservation policies impact
Reservation policies play a key role in facilitating access to higher education for socially disadvantaged groups. The quota system aims to provide fair representation and promote inclusion and diversity. One can infer that the State and Central government quotas and reservations are enabling more candidates from reserved categories to aspire for architecture and planning programs.
### Diversity and changing demographics  
With a larger pool of candidates from all sections of society writing these exams, the student community in colleges will reflect India's diverse demography. This trend is desirable as it fosters an atmosphere of cultural exchange. In the long run, it can help address socio-economic disparities through academic empowerment and career growth.
