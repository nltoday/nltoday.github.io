### Family Commitments and Discipline 
The lifestyle of an [Indian Police Service](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-holiday-santa-riding-rottweiler-dog-christmas-2), **Indian Administrative Service**, or **Indian Forest Service** officer is very busy. Often, they do not get time to establish their family well. If the civil servant in this country is honest, they generally face too many problems as it is easy to find corrupt individuals involved in corruption here. So, the stress to deal with such situations is quite normal. 
I can share the daily routine of my father who has 6 years of his service left. He has always been an honest officer. His day starts at 5:30 am, when my mother gets him a cup of tea. They look at the beautiful trees near their house together. By 6:00 am, he is doing his fitness routine and shaving as it is mandatory for every officer to maintain their figure and facial hair. My father used to wake us before leaving for work but never tidied his own bed! We hated his alarm clock. By 7:00 am, he is reading the newspaper. Around 8:00 am, he begins some paperwork. At 9:00 am, he gets ready in his uniform and has a light breakfast.

### Work Commitments and Long Hours
My father leaves for his unit office by 9:30 am. A constable is always provided to take care of his uniform and shoes. My father has his lunch break at 1:30 pm, where my mother sends his lunch with the constable. He is always busy with paperwork and meetings for most of the day. He gets home around 7:30 pm for family time until 8:30 pm. Dinner is at 9:30 pm followed by a small walk and sleep by 10:30 pm. However, **extraordinary events like terrorist attacks** or election duties mean he may leave home at 6 am and return at midnight with no knowledge of what he ate that day. 
### Fun Memories and the Importance of Discipline
One of my fondest memories is of a trip to Goa my father took us on in 2010. When we were on a cruise, I saw my father dancing just like in the song 'I Am a Disco Dancer' to the amusement of my mother and I. It was funny to see our parents dancing like youngsters at 45! My father always insisted I wear shoes rather than sandals or heels like my friends. Children of officers often realize the importance of money due to their parents making them understand the value of their hard-earned salary. 
### Stress of the Job and Long Hours
My father's **most stressful experience** was during the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks. He was called to work at 1:30 am and we did not hear from him until the next evening. Meetings with senior officials and preparing for inspections add to the challenges. Not only do they have little personal time, finding time to talk to family is difficult too. My son learned to send voice messages to my father on WhatsApp when he was young. Most officers work 9+ hours daily and over 100 hours some weeks during emergencies. Their weekends and holidays are usually still working days spent clearing complicated files. 
### Sacrifices, Salary, and Rewards 
The **only family vacation** officers get is one annual trip under Leave Travel Concession. Leaves beyond a week are only permitted for marriage. Their **salary is Rs. 40,000-65,000** which is less than other professionals for similar long hours and stress. Many IAS officers after decades of service have savings of just Rs. 10 lakhs with no property. Despite sacrifices, the happiness of connecting villages and relief efforts is unparalleled. A poor villager bringing them vegetables out of affection is rewarding. Though the job requires much personal sacrifice, the respect and impact of their work makes it worthwhile for dedicated officers.
### Daily Routine and Responsibilities  
A typical day starts with waking up at 5:30 am. After breakfast and reading the newspaper, work begins around 9:00 am. Officers are responsible for a wide range of tasks from reviewing paperwork and attending meetings to overseeing disaster relief or election operations. The work day usually stretches from 9:30 am to 9-10 pm on regular days. During emergencies or peak seasons, they may work up to 36 consecutive hours or 100+ hours in a week. Despite long hours, efficiency is key as the public depends on timely clearances and approvals. Officials also supervise subordinates while ensuring policies and rules are followed correctly. 
### Challenges on the Job
One of the major challenges is having to report to politicians and ministers who may be unreasonable at times. Dealing with protests, strikes or hostile groups demanding various favors is another daily difficulty. A small mistake can take a political angle rapidly. Many officers have faced assaults or false cases in retaliation for lawful actions. Work also entails challenging subordinates as officers cannot directly recruit, transfer or punish staff under them. Maintaining integrity and fairness while navigating political pressures tests an individual's strength of character. The sacrifices mean officers have limited personal finances despite national importance of their roles.
### Rewarding Impact and National Service
Despite challenges, most civil servants find their job hugely fulfilling for the positive difference they can make to citizens' lives. Connecting villages, supplying water, managing elections smoothly or providing relief in disasters leave officers with a deep sense of purpose. For dedicated individuals motivated by public service, small acts of gratitude like a villager's gift reaffirms their commitment. While the lifestyle demands significant personal sacrifices from family life to finances, the prestige and respect that comes with the job is high. Those who complete decades of service feel they have contributed invaluable nationwide experience. More than a career, it is a commitment to the national developmental mission.
### Conclusion
In summary, the life of a civil servant in India is one with immense responsibilities, long working hours and personal sacrifices but also tremendous opportunities to drive change. Upholding high standards of integrity and efficiency while navigating political realities tests character. Family ties face challenges due to the demanding schedule. However, for motivated public servants, the rewards come from positively impacting fellow citizens and the knowledge that their service is critical for the country's progress. It is an fulfilling profession for those who can make the lifestyle adjustments required to take on such a vital national role.
