Earning opportunities and experiences are what shaped this person's academic and professional path over the course of more than a decade. Read on to learn about their perseverance through exams, career shifts, and self-realization that ultimately led to acceptance into one of India's top B-schools.
## Early Years in Academics and the Start of a Career  
After **graduating with an electrical engineering degree** in 2012, they began working for **Accenture Consulting** to gain industry experience. While building their career, they kept challenging themselves academically by appearing for exams like IIFT, NMIMS, and SIBM in 2013 but did not join any programs at the time due to a keen interest in their current role. 
## A Change of Pace and New Challenges at SBI
In 2013, they made a career shift and started working as an officer with **State Bank of India (SBI)**. Over the next year, they balanced their job responsibilities while preparing to take the CAT exam again. Appearing for CAT'13, they scored in the **99th percentile** and had the option to pursue further studies but chose to gain more experience in their role for another year instead.
## Continued Self-Development and High Achievement  
In 2014, they reappeared for CAT and achieved an even higher score of **99.88 percentile**, showing their dedication to continuous self-improvement. This opened doors to top B-schools like **IIM Ahmedabad, IIM Calcutta, FMS, and more** for the 2015-2017 academic batch. After much deliberation, they decided to join **IIM Calcutta** to further elevate their management skills.
## A Fulfilling Career Path with SBI 
During their 12 years with SBI, they experienced **numerous transfers** across branches in different parts of the country gaining diverse exposure. One of their most enjoyable postings was as branch manager of a small rural outpost near the **Nepal border**, where they found the work environment and people to be very warm and pleasant. 
## Pursuit of Higher Studies despite Obstacles
Around the same time, feeling the need for more advanced studies, they applied for MBAs in the US but were denied a student visa. Undeterred, they decided to give the CAT another attempt while posted at a remote village branch of SBI, balancing full-time work responsibilities and self-study without formal coaching.
## Succeeding at CAT and IIM Interviews  
With sheer determination and hard work, they not only **cleared CAT'14 with flying colors** but also aced interviews for IIMs like IIMA despite the added challenges of work experience and age compared to other candidates. They credits their unusual profile of a working professional with industrial and rural job experiences for helping them stand out positively during the selection process.
## An Unprecedented Journey culminates at IIMA 
Finally in 2015, they realised their long-standing dream of studying at one of India's top B-schools. As the **oldest student in their batch with the maximum work ex** at IIMA, they inspired others on campus with their unique success story. In retrospect, they are grateful for all the opportunities and people they encountered throughout their **non-linear but very rewarding career and academic journey**.
## Valuable Lessons and Takeaways
Their story teaches us that success comes through **grit, perseverance and an open mindset**. No matter the obstacles, remaining optimistic and constantly upgrading one's knowledge and skills can help one achieve their true potential. Industries and roles may change over time but continued self-development is key to achieving professional and personal goals throughout one's lifetime.
