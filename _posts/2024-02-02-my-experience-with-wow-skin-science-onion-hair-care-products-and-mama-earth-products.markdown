WOW skin science is an Ayurvedic and natural skin and hair care brand from India. Here I share my experience using several of their onion-based haircare products along with comparison to Mama Earth haircare products.
### Improving Hair Quality and Reducing Hair Fall
I have dry and curly hair prone to dandruff and hair fall. After trying various commercial brands with no noticeable benefits, I decided to switch to natural products. I purchased the **WOW skin science red onion and black seed shampoo, conditioner and hair oil** kit based on positive reviews about its natural ingredients helping hair quality and reducing hair fall. Within two months of use, I noticed my hair was less dry and frizzy. The [rich botanical formula](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/alban) nourished and softened my hair texture. While I didn't see hair regrowth, the existing hair had grown significantly longer with less breakage. The hair oil in particular left my hair very shiny and smooth after massages.

### Increasing Hair Loss from Biotique and Mama Earth Products 
While the WOW skin science hair oil worked wonders for my hair, unfortunately the shampoo caused excess hair grease and fall. My scalp became irritated and dandruff increased severely. This prompted me to try **Mama Earth onion seed hair oil and shampoo**. However, to my dismay the hair loss increased even more to the point where just running my fingers through hair resulted in handfuls falling out. Neither the Biotique nor Mama Earth products seemed to suit my scalp's needs.
### Positive Results from WOW Skin Science Skin and Body Care Products
Changing to alternative WOW skin science products, I noticed vastly improved results. I started using their entire **natural skin and body care range containing only botanical extracts and essential oils without any harsh chemicals or preservatives.** The face wash, serum, scrub, and body lotion deeply nourished my skin without adverse effects. My complexion appeared brighter and softer. I particularly liked how the serum protected my skin from signs of aging and UV damage. The lightweight body lotion absorbed quickly to moisturize skin for hours without greasiness. Overall I'm very satisfied with WOW skin science's gentle yet effective natural skincare formulations.
### Choosing Wisely for Optimal Hair and Skin Health 
While natural hair and skin products seem promising on paper, it's important to test thoroughly and note individual suitability. Popular brands don't necessarily work for everyone. For me, the **WOW skin science hair oil and entire skin care range suited my needs best out of various commercial and natural options tested**. But their shampoo aggravated scalp issues. It's wise to patch test, observe effects over a few weeks, and swap products if any negative reactions occur. With the right natural product choices tailored to one's unique hair and skin type, it's possible to attain healthy, glowing, and problem-free locks and complexion.
### Improved Confidence and Self-Esteem  
Making the switch to natural products that truly work for my hair and skin without irritation uplifted my self-image greatly. Signs of damage like frizzy, thinning hair and blemishes started fading away. My scalp feels cleaner and soothed after using WOW skin science hair oil. The radiant glow from their skincare boosts my confidence whenever stepping out. Even family members compliment the improvements. Overall handling my locks and complexion with **Ayurvedic formulations sans harsh chemicals** elevated both my physical and mental well-being tremendously. I feel much happier and comfortable in my own skin.
### Recommended for Those Seeking Gentle Yet Potent Solutions
In conclusion, I would highly recommend exploring WOW skin science's natural options to anyone suffering hair, skin issues or seeking kinder formulations. While results may vary per individual, the brand delivered visible benefits to me without side effects - something commercial products failed to do. My life has become much easier managing healthy hair and skin with their fuss-free, 100% natural products. For those priorities wellness over synthetics and want potent solutions through traditional remedies, WOW skin science is an excellent choice worth considering.
