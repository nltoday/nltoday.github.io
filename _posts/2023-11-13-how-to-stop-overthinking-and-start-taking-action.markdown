## Understanding the Root of Overthinking
Fear is usually the root cause of overthinking. The fear can manifest in different forms like over analysis, over planning, procrastination, indecisiveness or perfectionism. At the core, it is meant to protect us from failure or uncertainty of success. Due to this fear, we try to think until we are certain of achieving success. However, getting to that point of absolute certainty is impossible since we can never imagine and think of all possible scenarios.  
### It Stems from Inside, Not Outside Circumstances
Where does this fear come from? Not from outside circumstances, goals, people or deadlines. It emanates from inside us. When negative thoughts arise based on our conditioning, our defense mechanisms react and we experience the feeling of fear. We are afraid of our inner **thoughts about 'failure'**, not failure itself. Most thoughts are reactions based on past experiences and memories.

## Understanding the Nature of Thoughts
### Thoughts are Like Dust Kicked Up by the Revving Engine
Most thoughts are just like dust kicked up when revving the engine more than needed. When that happens, we worry about the thinking and think even more to eliminate those extraneous thoughts - like revving the engine even more to kill the dust. 
### Thoughts are Not Reality
Reality exists outside our minds but what we experience is our inner thoughts about reality. The thoughts themselves are not real. So the anxieties and bad feelings that emerge from thoughts need not be taken too seriously. Thoughts can seem real but they are more like ghosts seen in the shadows - not substantively real.
## Letting Thoughts Be to Stop Overthinking 
### Stop Resisting and Feeding Extraneous Thoughts  
We need to do the opposite of what we normally do when finding ourselves thinking too much. Instead of worrying and trying to reduce thoughts, we must relax, slow down and take a break. Like dust already raised, we can't control thoughts that have already arisen. So we let those extra thoughts come up without resisting or feeding them. Then they will start fading away on their own.
### Act Despite Thoughts, Not Because of Them
In short, stop doing anything to directly stop thoughts. Then we will see that we can act despite our thoughts. We will see our actions do not have to depend on our thoughts, as most thoughts are just noise to be ignored. And as we get more comfortable simply letting thoughts be, our fear gets smaller and our actions become bigger.
## Getting from Thinking to Taking Action
### Connect with Your Body to Stay Present  
Focus on deep belly breathing, wiggle your toes, stretch - this helps stay present versus lost in thoughts. 
### Develop the Habit of Doing 
Get into the routine of taking action opportunities like making your bed each morning. Small, regular actions train a proactive habit over hesitating in thought.
### Automate Simple Decisions
Free up mental space by automating decisions like what to eat for breakfast daily. Less time spent on trivial choices leaves more for impactful actions.
### Schedule Spontaneity Each Day  
Talk to strangers, choose fresh routes - if not spontaneous by nature, build it with daily planned spontaneity. 
### Make Time to Decompress and Destress
Constant thinking and action can fatigue body and mind. Ensure relaxing timeouts like yoga to release built-up stresses preventing bold action. 
## Staying Process-Oriented Over Outcome-Driven
While ambition and diligence serve well, constantly seeking specific outcomes can also frustrate. Learn to value growth processes more than endpoints. Have patience and detachment from results. Focus on consistent, quality work rather than immediate effects. This maintains optimism and momentum over the long run.
In summary, overthinking often stems from inner fears rather than external realities. By understanding thought's nature and letting thoughts come without resistance, we can stop overthinking's unhelpful loops. Connecting with our bodies, developing proactive habits and choosing progress over perfection keep undue thinking from stalling bold action.
