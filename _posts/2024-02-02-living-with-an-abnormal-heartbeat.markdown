### My Strange Heart Symptoms
As an outdoor laborer my entire life, I've always had excellent cardiovascular health and fitness. However, around adolescence I began experiencing strange sensations from my heart. Even at rest, my heartbeat is remarkably low at just 40 beats per minute. According to my doctors, this is simply due to strong musculature in my heart developed from years of physical activity. 
While a lower resting heart rate is generally healthy, it sometimes causes awkward sensations. I can literally see the hair on my head quiver with each heartbeat. My head also feels like it's slightly quaking. It must be odd for others to witness. Despite living an active lifestyle, I can't help but wonder if there's something abnormal about my heart.

### Waking to Terror in the Night  
Like clockwork, the pulsating feelings only happen to me as I wake from sleep. An overwhelming terror washes over me as my whole body, especially from the waist up, pulses and quakes like an earthquake. It's the most terrifying feeling imaginable, lasting 3 to 5 harrowing minutes. No wonder it awakens me screaming in a panic!
After many sleepless nights, I consulted my doctor who believes this symptom is a result of severe panic attacks. Even when logically knowing it's just a panic symptom, it's impossible to convince my frightened mind and body that nothing is truly wrong. The power of the panic response can truly make one believe their life is in danger.
### Learning to Manage Panic Symptoms
It was such a relief to learn the probable cause of my strange post-sleep sensations. While panic itself is no walk in the park, at least it's not a sign of a serious medical issue. My doctor reassured me the sensations would pass once my panic subsided. 
To manage symptoms, she recommended cognitive behavioral therapy to challenge frightening thought patterns. Mindfulness meditation also helps quiet a racing mind. On really bad nights, taking an anti-anxiety medication can short-circuit a full-blown attack. 
With treatment, my panic attacks have become less frequent and intense over time. I still get the pulsating feelings occasionally, but mindfulness techniques allow me to ride them out calmly. Panic does not have to control my life or ruin my sleep. There is hope!
### Others Share Their Stories
Hearing stories from people in similar situations helps me feel less alone. One friend experiences the same heavy, body-shaking heartbeat throughout the day while sitting or lying down. Working from home, he rarely leaves his room - so what could be the underlying cause? 
Another acquaintance awakens regularly screaming "earthquake!" in a panic. But her family insists nothing unusual is happening. Could this also be due to nocturnal panic attacks like mine? 
Sharing experiences online, we've discovered our symptoms align with a condition known as **"palpitations caused by panic disorder"**. The internet is a treasure trove of information and support communities for uncommon health issues. Connecting with others makes all the difference.
### Finding Reassurance and Understanding  
After swapping stories, we've all felt tremendous reassurance knowing we're not alone - or having heart issues. While panic symptoms can seem so real and frightening, understanding the psychological basis has been liberating. We no longer fear something is seriously wrong with our hearts.
Family and friends try their best to be supportive, but cannot truly grasp the terror of sensations like heart palpitations or earthquake feelings during panic attacks. Connecting with others experiencing similar symptoms provides invaluable empathy and validation we can't get elsewhere. 
Whether during the day or waking episodes at night, none of us wish these panic manifestations upon anyone. But finding community makes coping much more manageable. Together, we continue learning to live well despite our abnormal heartbeats.
### Taking Back Control of Health Anxiety
For so long, the fear of a serious medical issue ruled me. Each strange heart sensation sent my anxiety spiraling out of control. But armed with education on panic disorder, supportive relationships, and coping tools, I no longer live in that prison of fear and doubt.
These days, though physical symptoms still arise occasionally like a test, I face them with hard-earned strength, courage and compassion for myself. My wellbeing is no longer at the whim of unpredictable palpitations. I now understand their origin and that I have nothing to fear.
My message to anyone else facing mysterious physical fears: you have so much power to reframe your perspective through learning, sharing with others for validation, and not believing every frightening thought or sensation. Take control by gaining knowledge - your wellbeing is worth the work. The worst is usually all in our heads, so be gentle with yourself as you continue growing into calmness.
