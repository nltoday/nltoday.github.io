### Using the Basic Spoiler Syntax
The simplest way to add spoiler text on Discord is by using the pipe symbol syntax. The pipe symbol ("|") is located below the backspace key and to the left of the enter key on most keyboards. To add a spoiler, type "||" before and after the text you want to spoil. [spoiler text formatting discord](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/adkisson) For example:
||This text will be hidden as a spoiler||
Users will see a blank box that they can click or tap on to reveal the hidden text. This basic approach works on both desktop and mobile versions of Discord.

### Customizing Spoilers with Formatting 
While the pipe symbol method is straightforward, you have more options to **customize spoiler styling**. Within a spoiler block, you can apply common text formatting like *italics*, **bold**, `code font`, and ~~strikethrough~~ as normal. Line breaks can be added with two spaces at the end of a line. Additionally, spoiler boxes automatically resize to fit long passages of text. This allows spoilers to maintain a tidy appearance without overflowing the message bounds.
### Adding Links and Media in Spoilers
Spoiler markup alsosupports embedding **links and media attachments**. Any valid URL, mentions of other users, or uploaded images/files placed between the pipe symbols will remain clickable or viewable once revealed. This enables clever uses like hiding screenshot "evidence" or playlists related to a story's plot Twist. Just be aware that very large media can cause the spoiler to expand more than intended on mobile. 
### Advanced Spoiler Techniques
For power users, there are more exotic spoiler techniques possible too. The role mentioning (@) syntax works inside spoilers, so roles can be pinged without notifying everyone. Conversely, you can also create "invisible" pings by mentioning without the @. Moreover, emoji reactions in spoilers will still be visible before revealing the text. With creativity, these advanced application can lead to fun secrets or puzzling riddles for observant server members.
### Using Spoiler Tags Strategically  
In general, the goal of spoiler formatting is to avoid ruining surprises while still sharing relevant insights. As such, it's best employed sparingly and with discretion. For gaming servers, plot details from new releases are obvious candidates. But spoilers also work for events, announcements, or anything some users may not want exposed prematurely. With clear context and courtesy, spoiler markup enables enriched discussion that includes both veterans and newcomers to a topic.
### Additional Discord Screen Sharing Tips
In addition to text-based spoilers, Discord's screen sharing feature allows hiding visual content until viewers are ready. When initiating a screen share session, users have the option to blur their desktop or choose a specific window to share privately. The presenter maintains control over unblurring parts of the display at their discretion. For planning events, conveying confidential project details, or just messing with friends, screen sharing expands spoiler potential beyond plain text. Combined with video calls, it enables truly collaborative hidden agendas.
### Customizing Server Settings for Spoilers
At the server level, admins have granular controls over spoiler settings too. Permissions can determine who has access to use or reveal spoilers. And the spoiler triggering delay, or time before text becomes visible after clicking, is configurable between 1-5 seconds. For real-time storytelling or trivia games, a longer delay builds suspense. Whereas for casual spoiler-tagging, the default 1 second is usually snappy enough. Tweaking these advanced options tailors the spoiler experience to each community's unique vibe.
### Conclusion - the Versatility of Spoiler Formatting
In summary, Discord's native spoiler tags open many doors for secrecy, suspense and surprise and users' creative sides. Whether hiding plot details, teasing future plans, or just messing with friends - spoilers bring an engaging social layer atop plain text. And with media embedding, formatting, and screen sharing extensions - their potential grows. For any server aiming to weave an immersive narrative or maintain confidential discussions, spoiler syntax is a key tool worth mastering.
