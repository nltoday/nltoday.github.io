Working as an employee at Roblox's India-based customer support center provided me with a uniquely disturbing glimpse into the company's exploitative practices. Though Roblox portrays itself as a fun, friendly platform for creativity and community, the reality of managing their massive user base comes at tremendous human cost. Here is my story.
## A Dream Job Gone Sour 
Roblox had seemed like such an exciting opportunity when I first applied - the chance to connect with fans all over the world and help shape their experience on a globally popular platform. However, it didn't take long to see the job's darker realities. The punishing workload and relentless scrutiny left little room for rest or error. Though I enjoyed assisting users, keeping up with the 80+ ticket quota in a 10 hour shift grew draining. Any small mistakes were met with harsh reprimands from supervisors treating us more like replaceable "resources" than people.

Earning a paltry $400 per month, the equivalent of just $2 per hour, I struggled to get by on Roblox's exploitative wages. Meanwhile, my managers showed little care for employees' wellbeing. During Covid's devastating second wave in India, the customer support center remained open despite confirmed cases among staff. Tragically, one young colleague lost her life after likely contracting the virus at work. Only stringent lockdown orders finally convinced Roblox to allow working from home, long after the damage was done.

## Harsh Treatment and Dehumanization 
Roblox's India-based leadership seemed intent on squeezing every last drop of effort from employees. The customer support director referred to us only as "resources" - cogs in the machine rather than human beings. Any small errors brought wrathful tirades, and mysterious firings kept all workers constantly anxious. Morale sunk even lower with Roblox's refusal to provide computers, expecting people to spend their meager salaries on equipment just to do the job. 
### **Rotationally Rotating Schedules Wreak Havoc** 
In a bizarre attempt to maximize workspace, Roblox split employees into alternating day and night shifts rotating every two months. This took a severe psychological toll, disrupting circadian rhythms and normal sleep patterns. Constantly adjusting sleep-wake cycles proved highly detrimental to mental and physical health over the long-term. But to management, our wellbeing mattered little - we were seen as disposable resources to be run into the ground.
## A Glimmer of Hope amid the Darkness
Despite the nightmarish conditions, tiny sparks of hope emerged. Fellow employees banded together, providing mutual support during our darkest hours. Knowing I wasn't alone in struggling gave strength. And seeing the joy we brought users, however fleeting, reminded why I had wanted this job in the first place. Those small bright spots fueled my determination to survive until a brighter future appeared.
### **Leaving Behind a Toxic Environment** 
Eventually, the toxic work culture prevailed and I knew it was time to go. Struggling financially after quitting, I leaned on friends and persevered and slowly rebuilt. Now, having found fulfilling work elsewhere, I feel compelled to share my story - to shine a light on Roblox's alarming labor practices and inhumane treatment of their customer support teams based abroad. While creative for kids, the company's exploitative backend deserves scrutiny and reform. No person deserves to be used and abused as Roblox allows.
## Seeking Accountability and Positive Change
Through telling my story, I hope to accomplish two goals. First, to make Roblox stakeholders aware of real harm done through their outsourcing model and encourage improved protection of offshore employees' rights and wellbeing. Second, to motivate concerned Roblox users, especially kids, to promote discussion around **ethical business practices** and workers' welfare when enjoying creative platforms. While change won't happen overnight, raised awareness is a start toward pressuring Roblox to enact meaningful reform and prevent others from suffering as I did. Together, through openness and action, we can work for a brighter future.
### In summary, my time at Roblox's India customer support center exposed a dark underbelly of exploitation that contradicted the company's fun, friendly image. By sharing my story, I aim to shine light on troubling practices and empower positive change - so no one else must endure the dehumanizing conditions I faced. With open dialogue and collective action, even huge corporations can reform unfair treatment of vulnerable workers worldwide.
