### What is TQWL?
TQWL stands for Tatkal Quota waiting list. It is a special waiting list generated when booking Tatkal tickets on Indian Railways. Previously, this waiting list was referred to as CKWL which stood for Current Known Waiting List. However, Indian Railways has recently changed it to TQWL.

### Features of TQWL
TQWL has some unique features as compared to the normal waiting list known as General Waiting List (GNWL):
[Tatkal quota ticket confirmation](https://store.fi.io.vn/white-frenchie-french-bulldog-starry-night-van-gogh-colorful-2) - During chart preparation, GNWL is preferred over TQWL. So Tatkal waitlisted tickets are less likely to get confirmed than those in the GNWL. 
**Direct confirmation** - If a Tatkal ticket goes into the waiting list during booking, it will be confirmed directly without going into the RAC/GNWL category. 
**Dropped during charting** - Tatkal tickets in the waiting list are dropped during chart preparation and the booking amount is refunded after deducting the reservation charges.
**Applicable for metro cities** - The TQWL is for passengers travelling from major metro and urban areas. 
**Similar to normal waiting list** - The format and functioning of TQWL is similar to the regular waiting list that passengers see after booking normal tickets.
### How does TQWL work?
When passengers book **tatkal tickets** through the IRCTC website or app, the reservation system generates either a confirmed ticket or places the PNR in the TQWL based on availability. Some key points about how TQWL functions:
- For tatkal bookings, the waiting list issued is TQWL instead of the normal GNWL.
- Unlike GNWL, a TQWL ticket is automatically upgraded to confirmed status instead of RAC if berths free up. 
- **Chart preparation** plays a big role - during this process, GNWL tickets get preference and TQWL tickets are more likely to get dropped/cancelled.
- **Confirmation chances** for TQWL tickets also depend on the day of travel. Weekend/holiday travel sees less cancellations compared to weekdays.
- The tatkal quota waiting list number determines ease of getting confirmed - lower numbers under 5 have better chances.
So in summary, while TQWL works on FIFO like the normal waiting list, it has some unique aspects benefitting regular tickets over Tatkal bookings.
