I've played many hours of Grand Theft Auto V over the years across both legitimate and pirated versions, and have learned a few things about transferring saves between the two that may help others. Here is a guide broken into several parts on how to do this safely and smoothly.
### Locating Your Save Files
The first step is always to locate where your save files are stored on your system. For GTA V, these are typically found within the "Documents" folder under "Rockstar Games". Make sure to back up this entire folder somewhere else on your drive in case anything goes wrong during the transfer process.

### Removing Cracks & Reinstalling Legitimately
If transferring from a pirated version, it's important to fully remove any cracks or modifications before installing the legitimate Steam version. Delete any files not part of the original installation, such as "steam_api.dll". Then redownload the full game through Steam. **GTA V crack removal Steam installation verification** 
### Importing Your Old Save
Once the legitimate version is installed cleanly via Steam, start a new game to generate the proper save folder structure. Then replace this new empty folder with your backed up save folder from earlier. Start the game to test if it loads correctly. **Grand Theft Auto V save file Steam save import verification**
### Handling Mods Carefully 
While single player mods are generally safe to use on pirated versions, be careful about any that remain active in memory when switching to the online mode of the Steam version. Rockstar is known to monitor for modifications being used between modes. **GTA V mods single player online mode memory resident mods**
### Alternate Save Locations
If importing the save doesn't work right away, some versions of GTA V store files in alternate locations depending on whether it's from Steam or a crack. Check readme files and do some digging to find where yours originally was saved. **Grand Theft Auto save locations Steam crack storage locations** 
### Fresh Start If Necessary
As a last resort, if the imported save causes issues, you may need to restart your game fresh without modifications on the legitimate Steam version. But with some patience, these steps typically allow pirates to keep their progress legitimately through Steam. **GTA V fresh start restart game legitimate version**
### Wrapping Up 
With the right precautions around file verification, mod management and backup planning, transferring a GTA V save between distribution methods is definitely possible. Be thorough in your preparations and willing to restart if problems occur. Most importantly, have fun continuing your criminal adventures legally through Steam.
