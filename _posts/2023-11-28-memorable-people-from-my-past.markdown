Growing up poor in a small town, there were a few individuals who made a profound impact on my life through their kindness, wisdom and compassion. Their influence helped shape who I am today.
### My Loving Uncle
Al was not only my momâ€™s brother, he was my godfather and he took that role seriously. [My childhood mentor and role model](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/abrahams), he always included a $5 bill in my birthday cards, which was equivalent to 3-4 hours of wages at the time. He and his wife took me in for sleepovers, and he talked and listened to me. I wanted to be just like **my generous and sweet uncle** who loved me deeply.

### Gaining Perspective on My Father
One evening when I was an adult, I sat with my dad and Uncle Al as they talked. Uncle Al obviously respected what my dad had done to provide for our family, taking in "a lot of little mouths to feed" during hard times. **Seeing a new side to my father and his struggles** changed how I viewed him. My hero looked up to my dad in a way others didn't understand.
### A Hospital Bedside Reconciliation  
Years later when my father was dying of cancer, I visited him at his request. The ogre from my memories was but a frail shadow of himself. As we talked, **he shared his pride in my accomplishments for the first time.** When my mother joined us, he broke down apologizing for how he'd treated her. **Fear of death can drive one to face lifelong regrets.** Our visit offered closure neither of us expected.
### An Act of Unexpected Kindness
As a shy 7th grader, I disliked my art teacher Miss Carillo despite her beauty due to her quick anger. One day after class, I came upon her struggling to change a flat tire. Without question, I helped fix it, **paying forward the lessons of kindness I'd learned.** She thanked me with a new understanding, and we became good friends. **Small acts can reshape perceptions and forge unexpected bonds.**  
### Lifelong Impact of Mentors  
These memorable people taught me invaluable life lessons through both words and deeds. **Unconditional love, forgiveness, compassion** - their influence endures as I strive to **pay kindness forward** and overcome hardships with courage, wisdom and grace. Though paths diverge, the imprint of a **meaningful mentor lasts forever.**
