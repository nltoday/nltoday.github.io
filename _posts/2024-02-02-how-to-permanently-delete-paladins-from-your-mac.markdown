### Getting Started
To begin the process of permanently deleting Paladins from your Mac, you'll first need to log into your Steam account and locate the game files. Launch the Steam client and click on the "Library" menu at the top of the screen. Then select **"MAC"** from the dropdown options to view all the games installed on your Mac through Steam. 
Once the full game library loads, use the search bar or scroll through the list to find **"Paladins"**. Right-click on the game title and select **"Delete Local Content"** from the context menu. This will prompt Steam to remove the downloaded files and shortcuts associated with Paladins, freeing up storage space on your hard drive.

### Double Checking File Deletion
While deleting the local content through Steam removes most of the game install, some residual files may remain. To [fully remove paladins from mac](https://store.fi.io.vn/work-hard-so-my-rat-terrier-live-a-better-dog-lover-2), it's a good idea to double check for any leftover files. Open Finder and navigate to the **"Downloads"** folder to look for any remaining Paladins-related items. 
If you spot the Paladins application icon, select it and drag it to the Trash icon at the bottom of the screen. Taking this extra step ensures the installation is completely wiped from your system. Always empty the Trash after deleting files to permanently remove them from your Mac.
### Searching Other Locations
It's also worth searching a few other common locations for any Paladins files that may have been missed. Open the **"Applications"** folder in Finder and scan for the game's icon. Check date modified to distinguish it from any other apps. 
Another place to look is inside your user **"Library"** folder, accessible by holding the "Option" key when clicking "Go" in Finder. Open **"Application Support"** and see if a **"Paladins"** subfolder exists with leftover configs or saves. Select and trash any traces found.
### Uninstalling Through Steam 
For the most thorough uninstall, it's best to use Steam's built-in uninstall process. Launch the client again and click **"Library"** in the top menu bar. Next, click the **"Installed"** option on the left sidebar to view your full game library.
Use the search or scroll until you locate **"Paladins"**, then right-click and select **"Uninstall"** from the pop-up menu. This allows Steam to properly remove any registration files or leftover settings it created during the original installation process. 
The uninstall may take a few minutes to complete as Steam scrubs your system. Once finished, Paladins will be removed from your game library as well. Reboot your Mac to clear any cached data.
### Manual File Deletion
If for any reason the Steam uninstall fails to fully remove Paladins, you may need to hunt down remaining files manually. Open Finder and type "Paladins" into the search bar at the top to locate matching items on your system. 
Pay close attention to dates modified to distinguish older Paladins files from generic system files. Once identified, select each one individually and drag to the Trash. Empty the trash afterwards. 
Some places to search include your user **"/Library/Application Support"**, **"/Library/Preferences"** and **"/Library/Caches"** folders. Also scan any external drives in case files were installed elsewhere.
### Uninstalling from Launchpad
Finally, uninstalling the Paladins application itself from Launchpad. Open the program via Spotlight or click the Launchpad icon in your dock. Locate the Paladins icon amongst your installed apps.
Hover your cursor over the icon until it starts wiggling, then press the "Backspace/Delete" key to remove it. This deletes the launcher without touching any game files. Still perform the Steam uninstall and file search steps to fully remove Paladins.
### Completing the Uninstall 
Once you've deleted local content through Steam, searched for and trashed any remaining files manually, and removed the app from Launchpad - Paladins should now be fully uninstalled from your Mac. 
To wrap things up, empty your Trash and restart your computer. This clears any caches or memory leftover from the uninstall process. You can also optionally run disk optimization tools like "Onyx" to further clean up unused space. 
With these comprehensive steps, Paladins and all of its data is now completely removed from your Mac without a trace. You're free to reclaim the disk space for other uses going forward.
