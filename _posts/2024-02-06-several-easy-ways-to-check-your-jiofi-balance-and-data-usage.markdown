## Checking JioFi Balance Online
Accessing your JioFi dashboard online is one of the simplest ways to check your balance and data usage. All you need is an internet connection on your device and login credentials for your Jio account. 
### Logging into Your Online Jio Account
Open your preferred web browser and navigate to the official Jio website at www.jio.com. At the top right corner, locate and click the "Sign In" option. You will be prompted to enter your Jio phone number and verify your identity with an OTP. Once logged in, your JioFi [balance and data usage details](https://yt.io.vn/collection/aber) will be readily visible on the main dashboard.

### Viewing Current and Upcoming Plans 
Scrolling further down the homepage, you will find the "My Plans" section listing your active and upcoming recharge plans. This allows you to view important details like **data allocation, validity period and recharge amount** for each plan at a glance. You can also generate detailed recharge statements from the "My Statement" tab.
## Checking Balance via MyJio App
The MyJio app offers another effortless method to access your JioFi account on your smartphone. It synchronizes seamlessly with your online Jio profile.
### Downloading and Logging into the App
First, download the MyJio app from the Google Play Store or iOS App Store. Open the app and sign in using the same credentials as your Jio website login. Your JioFi **balance and current plan** will load automatically on the homescreen. 
### Viewing Data Usage and Plan Details
To check itemized data consumption and validity of your active plan, swipe left from the edge of the screen to open the side menu. Select the "My Plans" option from here. This brings up a breakdown of your current JioFi **plan details including allocated data and expiration date**.
## Checking Balance Without an App or Internet 
If you need to check balance without internet access, the JioFi device settings provide an alternate option. 
### Accessing the Device Interface
Remove the battery from your JioFi router to find the serial number and default login credentials printed on the sticker. Replace the battery, connect to the wifi and visit the IP address listed on the sticker using a browser on any device. 
### Viewing Network Statistics
Once logged in, navigate to the Networking sections like LAN, WAN or Status to view network traffic statistics. The upload and download figures here when added provide an estimate of your approximate remaining JioFi **balance without an internet connection**.
## Linking Your JioFi to MyJio For Remote Access  
For added convenience, you can link your JioFi device to the MyJio app profile.
### Connecting Using SIM Authentication
Insert the JioFi SIM into any smartphone and open MyJio. Select "Link New Account" and enter the OTP. The app will automatically detect the SIM and save it to your profile upon successful validation.
### Managing Accounts on the Go
Now with your JioFi remotely connected, simply open MyJio to check balances and data usage details of both your smartphone and JioFi accounts from anywhere, even without the physical JioFi device. This allows seamless on-the-go management of your JioFi **balance and data usage** via a single app.
