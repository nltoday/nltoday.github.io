### Introducing Relative Pronouns
Relative pronouns are words used to join or link two sentences together by referring to a noun or pronoun in an independent clause. Some common relative pronouns in English include [who](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/agnello), **which**, **that**, **whose**, **whom** and **what**. In this article, we will explore the different uses and functions of these relative pronouns through examples.

### When as a Relative Pronoun
The relative pronoun **when** is used to refer to a point or period of time. A sentence using **when** as a relative pronoun would be "That was the year **when** I graduated from college." **When** connects the two clauses and refers back to the time mentioned in the first clause. **When** can also be used as an interrogative adverb to ask about a time, as in " **When** will the meeting be held?".
### Where as a Relative Pronoun
Like **when**, the relative pronoun **where** is also used to refer to a location or place. An example would be "This is the park **where** I used to play as a child." **Where** links the two clauses and refers back to the place mentioned earlier. **Where** can also function as an interrogative adverb, for questions about location such as " **Where** is the library located?".
### Who and Whom as Relative Pronouns 
The relative pronouns **who** and **whom** are used to refer to people or persons. **Who** is used as the subject of the clause, while **whom** is used as the object. For example, "This is the teacher **who** taught me English" and "This is the person **whom** I spoke to yesterday." **Who** and **whom** ask about people in interrogative sentences like " **Who** called earlier?" and " **Whom** did you meet?".
### Which and That as Relative Pronouns
The relative pronouns **which** and **that** are both used to refer to things, animals or an entire clause. However, **which** is generally used with non-defining/non-essential relative clauses, while **that** can be used with both defining/essential and non-defining clauses. For instance, "The book **that** I read was interesting" versus "The laptop, **which** was on sale, was quite expensive." 
### Whose as a Relative Pronoun
The pronoun **whose** is used to ask or talk about possession or ownership. A sentence would be "This is the house **whose** windows need repairing." Interrogatively, it may be used as " **Whose** bag is this?" to enquire about something's owner. **Whose** always follows the word it refers back to.
### What as a Relative Pronoun
The multi-functional word **what** can serve as an interrogative pronoun, an interrogative adjective, or a relative pronoun. As a relative pronoun, **what** is used to refer to things in a nonspecific, general sense. For example, "I'll never forget **what** you said to me." It can also be used interrogatively as in " **What** book are you reading?".
### Summary
In this detailed exploration of the different relative pronouns in English, we have seen **who**, **which**, **that**, **whose**, **whom**, **when**, **where** and **what** functioning as connectors between sentences by referring back to a person, thing, place or time mentioned earlier. Understanding their uses as both relative pronouns and interrogatives helps improve grammar and sentence construction abilities. I hope this guide has helped shed some light on these important linguistic tools.
