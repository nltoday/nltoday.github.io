### Defining Moksha and Our Purpose
Moksha is the ultimate goal in Hinduism - the liberation from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. According to Vedic astrology, every individual is on a journey to achieve moksha and attain salvation. Our [chosen spiritual deity](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cow-farmer-i-love-farm-things-i-do-in-my-spare-time-funny-v-neck-t-shirt/men&) or Ishta Devata acts as our spiritual guide, helping us live a purposeful life and directing us towards moksha. Unlike our family deity, the Ishta Devata is uniquely tailored for each person's soul journey. Identifying our Ishta Devata allows us to strengthen our spiritual connection and progress faster on the path of liberation.

### Locating the Atmakaraka 
The key to discovering our Ishta Devata lies in our birth chart. We must first locate the **planet with the highest degrees**, known as the Atmakaraka. This signifies our soul essence and destiny. Then, we examine the Atmakaraka's placement in the **Navamsa chart** (9th harmonic chart), which represents dharma and purpose. The house occupied by the Atmakaraka in Navamsa is called the **Karakamsa**, and holds clues to our chosen deity.
### Reading the 12th House from Karakamsa
We count the 12th house from the Karakamsa, as this signifies spiritual practices and detachment. The planet posited here reveals our **guiding spiritual entity**. If the house is empty, we consider the house lord. Rarely, Rahu or Ketu may indicate our Ishta Devata through their placement from the anti-clockwise 12th house. By understanding the planetary deity correlations, our personal **godform is uncovered**.
### Correlating Planets to Deities
Each celestial being has associations with certain divine figures in Hinduism. The Sun links to Lord Shiva, the Moon reflects Lord Krishna's nourishing energy, and Mars' fiery traits connect it to Hanuman. In this way, by comprehending the planet symbolizing our Ishta Devata, we can devote ourselves to the correlated celestial being. This establishes a strong **karmic-spiritual connection** that pave the path towards salvation.
### Guidance of Lord Vishnu 
Lord Vishnu holds a special role as the supreme preserver and guidor towards moksha. Many astrologers believe His various avataric forms provide salvation for souks correlated to each planet. Getting in tune with Vishnu hastens one's spiritual evolution. For example, those guided by the Sun may find solace in Rama's devotion, while Moon souls reconnect to Krishna. This personalized worship of **Vishnu's divine forms** aids the liberation process.
### Strengthening your Relationship with Your Ishta Devata
Once the Indicating planet is identified, focusing intentions and rituals upon the correlated celestial being builds a personal bond. Chanting **mantras** of your Ishta Devata, performing puja, offering prayers and surrendering all actions to their will slowly strengthens the karmic connection. Over lifetimes, this elevates one's chakras until moksha or oneness with the divine is attained. Having clarity about your guiding entity assists your dharma and purpose and hastens the journey to salvation.
