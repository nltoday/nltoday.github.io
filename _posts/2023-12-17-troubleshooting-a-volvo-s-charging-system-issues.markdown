The first step is to ensure the problem lies with the charging system. Let's review the symptoms and test the battery and alternator. 
### Testing the Battery and Alternator
You mentioned replacing the battery and alternator without diagnosing their true condition. To properly test: 
Use a multimeter to check the battery voltage - below 12.4V indicates it needs charging or replacing. Crank the engine and check for over 13V - below that suggests alternator issues. Confirm with an [alternator load test](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-holiday-santa-riding-rottweiler-dog-christmas-2) using a diagnostic tool.

### Tracing Wiring and Connections  
Examine wiring from the battery to alternator and within the chassis for damage, corrosion or loose connectors. Pay close attention to the **battery ground cable** and **alternator output cable** - these are common weak points. 
### Checking the Charging System Operation
With a diagnostic tool, observe voltages with the engine running. The **alternator output voltage** should rise above 13V. Fluctuations could mean a faulty regulator or diode pack. 
### Diagnosing a Parasitic Draw
An ammeter is needed to measure current draw with everything disconnected. record the **quiescent current value** - above 500mAh likely indicates a short or switched circuit left on. Narrow it down by reconnecting fuses one at a time.
### Inspecting the ECU Programming
Some ECUs need to be reprogrammed after battery/alternator swaps. Reconnect and perform an **ECU code scan** for any faults stored. Clearing codes may be needed after repairs. 
### Isolating Intermittent Issues  
For problems that don't occur all the time, use a data logger to record voltages over time. This can identify a **loose or corroded connection** that acts up intermittently due to vibration. 
### Consulting a Repair Manual  
Always refer to a service manual for your specific Volvo model. Wiring diagrams and component tests will help thoroughly diagnose the root cause. Rule out other faulty modules by cross-referencing DTCs.
### Pursuing Further Diagnostics
If the charging system checks out ok, the fault could lie elsewhere that draws more power, like an electric fan, power windows or audio system. Consider a diagnostic scan of the whole system n narrow down the fault. Don't replace parts without ruling out all other potential causes first.
