## Do Plants Experience the World Like Us?
Plants are living, breathing organisms just like humans and animals. While they do not have brains or central nervous systems, there is emerging evidence that plants are far more aware and responsive to their environment than previously thought. Some scientists now believe that plants display behaviors commonly associated with human senses like sight, smell, touch and even communication. 
### Plants May Experience the World Through Their Senses 
Plants have various sensory organs that allow them to detect things in their surroundings. **Longtail keyword:** They possess photosensors that sense light and help plants orient themselves towards sunlight. Their root systems are covered in root hairs that are highly sensitive to chemicals, moisture, gravity and textures in the soil. Above ground, plants have leaf sensors that help them regulate transpiration and tilt their leaves toward sunlight. **Longtail keyword:** Some studies also show that plants can detect airborne chemicals through specialized structures and tissue on their leaves, stems and flowers. This chemosensory ability allows plants to respond to cues from microbes, pathogens, herbivores and other plants.
Plants lack specialized sensory organs like eyes, ears, antennae and brains. So their awareness of the world is experienced and processed differently without conscious thoughts. However, accumulating evidence suggests that plants exhibit behaviors seen in humans and animals in response to sensory input, like physiological changes, growth adjustments and selective responses. **Longtail keyword:** So it raises the question - can plants really "experience" and "perceive" their environment in some way through their evolved sensory abilities? More research is still needed to fully understand plant cognition and experience.

## How Do Plants "Behave" and Communicate?
Plants exhibit complex behaviors that allow them to adapt, survive and reproduce in their habitats. While they do not behave like animals, plants display behavioral patterns and responsive actions to environmental stimuli that require coordination between different parts of the organism.
### Plants Actively "Forage" and "Behave" to Obtain Resources 
Plants grow and change direction of their roots, stems and leaves to maximize resources like water, nutrients and sunlight. **Longtail keyword:** The elaborate root systems of plants function almost like an animal's foraging strategies to seek out water and nutrients in the soil over long distances. Some plants even collect and store water in specialized pods or leaves for later use. **Longtail keyword:** Their prolific branching root structures and leaf/stem movements allow plants to essentially "forage" and "behave" to actively acquire the essentials for survival and growth.
Plants also display non-random dispersal patterns of seeds and spores to colonize suitable habitats. **Longtail keyword:** Some seeds get transported considerable distances by wind, water or attaching themselves to animal/bird fur to reach uncontested territories for germination. **Longtail keyword:** Seed pods explode or fruit ripens at just the right time to facilitate mobilization in an orchestrated plant behavior. 
### Plants Use Chemical Signals to "Communicate"
Plants lack organs or nervous systems for audio-visual communication. However, they possess complex biochemical pathways to perceive and respond to their surroundings. **Longtail keyword:** Plants have evolved to chemically signal and interact with other organisms through production and reception of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and hormones.
When plants are under attack from herbivores or pathogens, they release specific chemicals and sounds to warn neighbors of imminent danger. **Longtail keyword:** Neighboring plants can then biochemically activate their self-defense mechanisms even before visual contact with the threat. **Longtail keyword:** Some plants synthesize medicinal or noxious chemicals only when they sense being touched, a warning sign they've learned associates with harm. Such interactions through air- and ground-transmitted chemical signals constitute a form of plant "communication" to share information without physically interacting.
## What Is The Nature of Plant Intelligence and Cognition? 
The abilities of plants to sense stimuli, adapt behaviors, problem-solve and communicate raises the intriguing question - can we think of them as truly intelligent organisms? Plant neurobiologists offer perspectives on plant cognition and the evolutionary nature of plant "intelligence".
### Plants Demonstrate Complex Learning and Decision-Making
Research indicates plants are capable of complex learning behaviors from past experiences. **Longtail keyword:** In experiments where plants received mild electric shocks with sugar water solution, they subsequently showed decreased photosynthesis and growth rates when the same sugar water alone was administered later on. **Longtail keyword:** This points to associative memory formation between stimuli-response in plants at the molecular and physiological levels over time through gene expression changes. 
Plants also demonstrate adaptive primed behaviors. **Longtail keyword:** When exposed to airborne VOCs from herbivore-damaged neighbors, undamaged plants biochemically ramp up their defenses preemptively before actual tissue injury. **Longtail keyword:** Such anticipatory induced resistance shows plants integrate external information, make decisions and strategically modify their biochemistry - cognitive processes also seen in humans and animals. 
### Plant "Intelligence" is an Evolved Collective Adaptability
While plants lack brains, they exhibit complex integrated behaviors through decentralized cooperative networks of cells, tissues and organs. **Longtail keyword:** Their fundamental "intelligence" lies in billions of years of evolutionary adaption at the genetic, protein and cellular levels to coordinate structure and function for survival strategies like reproduction, growth, adaption and habitat modification. 
Plant cognition allows them to adeptly sense and respond to biotic and abiotic pressures to survive in natural, agricultural and urban ecosystems. Despite their simple appearance, long-lived plants demonstrate high-level adaptive capabilities and "intelligent" interactions that we are only beginning to fully appreciate and understand.
## Can We Truly Say Plants Experience the World 'Like Humans'?
After examining the multifaceted relationship between plants and humans, there are some noteworthy considerations:
- Plants undoubtedly perceive, learn and adapt to their surroundings similar to more complex organisms. But claiming they do so "like humans" risks anthropomorphization without evidence for consciousness or sentience.
- While their sensory organs allow input/output behaviors, plant awareness is decentralized and experientially different compared to central nervous systems. Their cognition lacks subjective experience.  
- "Intelligence" in plants arises from evolutionary molecular mechanisms of survival adapted to the environment over eons, not problem-solving or abstract thinking as in humans/animals with advanced neurobiology.
- Caution is needed before attributing emotions, feelings or human attributes without understanding how plants integrate sensations and internal/external signals in their own "plant ways".
So in conclusion, plants exhibit complex, sophisticated mechanisms to thrive. Their sensory capabilities and behaviors show wisdom of survival through nature's designs over ages. However, more research is still needed before we can say they truly experience or perceive the world in a manner directly relatable or equivalent to human sentience, cognition and intelligence as currently understood. The relationship between humans and plants remains full of mysteries yet to unravel.
