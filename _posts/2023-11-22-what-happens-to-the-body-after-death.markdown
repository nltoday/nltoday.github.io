### Signs of Life Fading
As life ebbs away, the body undergoes noticeable physical changes. [muscle relaxation after death](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-crazy-beagle-lady-dog-lover-v-neck-t-shirt/men&) begins, with **sphincters and muscles loosening**. The **jaw usually falls slack** as the mouth hangs open. The **eyelids relax back**, revealing eyes rolled upwards. If present at the final breath, one could prop the jaw closed with a towel and hold the eyelids shut for 10-15 minutes until **rigor mortis** starts to set in. However, there is little practical purpose as the mortician will position the body later.

### Witnessing the Last Moments
Watching someone **die naturally** can be distressing to observe. As a doctor, I had seen many **cancer patients** in their final days go through **agonal respiration**, gasping for air as death approached. Afterwards, their mouths remained slightly agape. Since the eyes were open in life, they often remained open in death as well. The experience led me to specialize in **ophthalmology**, avoiding having to witness death directly. 
### Odd Occurrences at Death
Nursing staff may see unusual events around passing. In one case, a person appeared to briefly wake up and breathe after resuscitation ended and the family arrived. This was likely due to residual **drug effects** in their system. In rare instances, a **pacemaker** may still be active after the heart stops beating, generating electrical signals. As an emergency nurse, I had seen various cases where people died with their eyes open, which we would gently close out of respect.
### Preparing the Body for Families  
As healthcare workers, we had a duty to **clean and prepare the deceased** with dignity before being transferred. For **nursing home residents** who passed alone, closing their eyes or mouth seemed unnecessary and even disrespectful of their natural state. Our role was one of care, not alteration of their appearance post-mortem simply for our own comfort levels. Respecting the departed's dignity was paramount.
### Understanding Normal Post-Mortem Changes  
**Morticians** possess valuable expertise in what happens to the human body after the final breath. Through their work, they understand the typical post-mortem physical transformations the body undergoes. **Muscle relaxation, loss of bowel and bladder control** are standard as life departs. Bruising and lividity may develop as blood settles in the lower areas. While an unquiet passing can be disturbing to witness, recognizing normal **post-mortem changes** helps provide closure.
### Last Moments and Beyond
For those present at a loved one's death, the experience leaves a profound impact. As nurses and caregivers, we did our best to handle each person's **passing with compassion**. When possible, gently closing eyes or mouth offered a measure of modesty. However, the natural order after death should not be artificially restructured solely for the viewer's comfort. Our role was respectful care of the individual, not alteration of their state. In death as in life, each person departs this world with inherent dignity that we aim to preserve.
### Insights from Mortuary Practice  
Morticians can offer valuable perspective through their work with deceased individuals. Beyond typical physical transformations, they may observe occasional anomalies or variations in the **post-mortem timeline**. With experience and scientific understanding, mortuary professionals can help dispel fears and provide reassurance around what to expect. For those in healthcare dealing with death regularly, conversing with morticians supports coping through knowledge of the natural human **mortal journey**. Overall, respecting normal post-mortem processes with compassion defines dignified end-of-life care.
