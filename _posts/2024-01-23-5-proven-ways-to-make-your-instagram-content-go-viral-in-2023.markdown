### Leverage Trending Topics and Hashtags
Tapping into trending topics and hashtags is a great way to ride momentum and expose your content to a wider audience on Instagram. By creating content related to current events, popular movies, TV shows or viral challenges, you increase the chances of your posts being discovered and engaged with. You should also include **relevant hashtags like

#instafamous** in your captions. Hashtags allow others searching related topics to easily find your content. While hashtags have minor impact on Reels specifically, they continue helping with discovery of other content types.
Instagram also features an "Explore" page where trending content is frequently showcased. **Getting featured on the Explore page** with a viral post is the holy grail for exposure. Carefully watching trends and reacting quickly with unique yet relatable takes can help get your posts in front of the massive Explore page audience. Leveraging trends is a proven strategy that many top Instagram accounts rely on for reaching new followers outside their regular circle.
### Use Engaging Visuals and Videos  
As a highly visual platform, Instagram favors bright, high-quality visual content over written posts. Stunning images like beautiful landscapes, sunsets, artsy shots have a higher chance of grabbing people's attention versus run-of-the-mill selfies. Similarly, captivating videos especially Instagram Reels are more likely to go viral. Creative video content demonstrating skills, telling stories or showing glimpses of exotic lifestyles are proven to perform well. 
For videos, you should focus on being visually appealing with smooth transitions, colorful grading and intriguing clips that leave viewers wanting more. Adding trending songs as described earlier also boosts video engagement. Professionally shot, well-lit videos with a cinematic quality have a better chance of spreading than low-effort home videos. Instead of long-form videos, focus your efforts on short Instagram Reels formatted clips that are bite-sized and shareable.
### Create Relatable User-Generated Content
Another proven strategy is to share user-generated content that shows everyday moments people can relate to. Behind-the-scenes lifestyle videos, photographing your pets, kids, hobbies or meals you Cook give followers an authentic glimpse into your world. Personalized content forging connections performs better than promotional marketing messages. People connect with other people, so show your human side freely to build rapport and a loyal following interested in your genuine experiences. Leverage user-generated posts from your engaged followers as well to spread your message organically.
### Leverage Emotion and Humor
Content that evokes an emotional response whether positive or negative is more likely to spread. Posts that make people laugh, cry or simply feel something spread faster due to human nature of wanting to share such impactful experiences. Funny videos, memes, comedy sketches are proven to get actively engaged as people want to share the laughter. On the other hand, highly emotional stories touching on social issues also gain traction through resonating with people on a human level. Sprinkling humor into your feed at regular intervals keeps audiences entertained and coming back for more.
### Reproduce Proven Successful Formats
Instead of reinventing the wheel, analyze what top performers in your niche are doing right and replicate elements that are clearly effective. For example, many viral animal videos follow a proven “cute animal doing funny thing” format. If you have an adorable pet, don’t be afraid to recreate a similar scenario that’s proven to delight audiences worldwide. Top food Instagrammers leverage appealing flat lays, product videos, cooking tutorials or recipe posts that gained millions of views for others. Reproducing elements from tested formats gives your content a higher chance of success versus random untested styles. Always add your unique spin instead of direct duplication to protect originality.
In conclusion, to make your Instagram content go viral, focus on creating high-quality visuals people want to engage with while riding trends. Leverage proven strategies like humor, emotion and relatable user-generated content that audiences connect with. Analyze top performers for replicating tested successful styles. With regular practice of these tactics and valuable new types of engaging content, consistent virality could become more achievable for your Instagram profile over time too.
