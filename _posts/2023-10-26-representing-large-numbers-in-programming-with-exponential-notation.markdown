Scientific notation and exponential notation are commonly used in programming languages to concisely represent very large or very small numeric values. This allows programmers to work with a wide range of numbers without having to write out long strings of digits.
### What is Exponential Notation?
Exponential notation, also called scientific notation, uses a number and exponent to efficiently write very large or small values. It is denoted by a number followed by "e" and the exponent. For example, [1e9](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-holiday-funny-santa-shetland-sheepdog-christmas-tree-2) represents one billion, or 1,000,000,000. The "e" stands for "times ten to the power of" - so 1e9 means 1 Ã— 10^9.
Programming languages adopted this notation because it is much easier and less error-prone to type than writing out long strings of zeros. Exponential notation automatically scales numeric values up or down as needed.

### Applications in Programming
Exponential notation is commonly used in programming for tasks that require high precision numeric values, like scientific computing. It allows representing very large or small values without losing precision. Some examples:
- Storing timestamp values with microsecond or nanosecond precision over long periods. 1.5e12 represents 1.5 trillion milliseconds. 
- Modeling physical phenomena with values that may range over many orders of magnitude, like particle energies in high-energy physics experiments.
- Financial calculations dealing with interest rates, currency exchange rates, or stock prices that can fluctuate greatly over time. 
- Simulations requiring precision, like modeling planetary orbits or signal processing. Values like 1e-20 are needed to represent tiny fractions or differences.
### Ease of Use in Code
Programming languages adopt this notation because it integrates seamlessly into code. Values written with exponential notation can be directly used in calculations and comparisons without conversion.
For example, the code snippet below initializes two float variables to represent a very small and very large numeric value:
```
float low = 1e-9; 
float high = 1e9;
```
These variables can then be used directly in further calculations without having to manually write out long strings of zeros each time.
### Representing Negative Exponents
The exponent can also be negative to efficiently represent very small numbers. For example, **1e-9** means one billionth, or 0.000000001. Negative exponents scale the number down instead of up.
This allows representing a wide continuous numeric range from very large to very tiny values with a simple, consistent notation that integrates directly into programming languages. Exponential notation removes the need for special formatting of large or small numbers in code.
### Summary
In summary, exponential notation provides a clear and concise way to represent extremely large and small numeric values in programming. Adopted from scientific notation, it scales values up and down as needed using exponents. This integrated notation simplifies code readability and precision handling for tasks involving high magnitudes, without losing accuracy or requiring conversion of values.
