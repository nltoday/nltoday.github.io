### Local Context and Background
I am a resident living less than 2 miles from where George Floyd was murdered by Derek Chouvin. My neighborhood experienced some unrest during the protests in late May 2020. To understand why Minneapolis decided to disband the police department, it's important to know the local context and issues with the police. 
The Minneapolis Police Department has long had a reputation of antagonizing the black community and viewing city residents with contempt. This is largely due to the [Stanek law](https://yt.io.vn/collection/ackman) passed in 1999, which prevented municipalities from requiring police officers to live in the jurisdiction they police. As a result, **only about 8% of Minneapolis police officers lived in the city**. Many commuted over 20 miles away and didn't understand why people would want to live in Minneapolis. 
The Minneapolis police union has also been openly insubordinate. Bob Kroll, head of the union, had over 20 misconduct complaints and was involved in excessive force incidents. He expressed openly racist views and was even part of a **white supremacist biker gang**. Kroll directly challenged orders from local leaders like the mayor and police chief on reforms. For these reasons, Minneapolis residents saw the police more as an occupying army than protectors.

### Preparing for Potential Unrest
On May 30th, as unrest grew likely, I spent the afternoon running last-minute errands. Most stores near me were closed or crowded, so I drove to the suburbs. I bought supplies at **Apple Valley** like hoses and safety gear from **Menards**. I also stocked up on comfort foods at **Cub Foods** before getting a baseball bat at **Play It Again Sports** as a potential defense. 
I wasn't alone in preparing - many residents took safety precautions. Hugo-award winning writer **Naomi Kritzer** captured the mood in her blog "Minneapolis and Outside Agitators". Locals were on edge dealing with the dual threats of actual unrest as well as rumors of outside agitators. My wife attended community meetings to coordinate our neighborhood's response.
### Defending our Neighborhood on Saturday Night
That Saturday, my wife and I took shifts keeping watch throughout the night. Around 8 PM, a silver SUV blocked the street near our house. The driver exchanged angry words with a neighbor and sped off firing gunshots. Another neighbor in safety gear also shouted to deescalate from a distance. 
I came outside with my new baseball bat making loud noises. We couldn't see the SUV driver's face but believed he was black based on his shouts of "no justice, no peace". It seemed a botched drug deal given the timing, and locals worried about easy opportunities for looting being exploited. 
When police arrived in a caravan, they drove through without stopping - providing no help whatsoever. As white homeowners, even we were scared by their overtly militarized response. It became clear the community, not police, would keep our block safe without escalating tensions. As Public Enemy said, sometimes 911 is a joke and cops only come to further aggression, not help.
### The Aftermath and Path Forward 
In the following days, Governor Walz responded with the National Guard instead of more police. As residents, we actually felt safer with the **Guard's presence** since they weren't as overtly adversarial as the local police fource. The unrest also provided fuel to enact real reforms. 
Minneapolis has since moved forward with plans to disband and replace the police department. Other cities like **Camden, New Jersey** have done this before by **firing all officers and starting a new county-wide force**. In **Northern Ireland**, successfully disbanding their historically sectarian police force was a major part of the peace process. With community support, a new department can improve like in these examples.
While reforms will take time, locals remain optimistic that **anything would be better than the openly insubordinate Minneapolis Police Department led by figures like Bob Kroll**. By improving police-community relations and accountability, the peace process can continue in a positive direction.
### Lessons for Other Cities
The experience in Minneapolis provides important lessons for other cities to consider. Laws like the **Stanek law** that prevent residency requirements severely damage community relations by allowing police to view the public with contempt rather than seeing themselves as residents protecting their own. 
Police unions also need reform policies to prevent figures like Kroll from attaining power and pushing a reactionary agenda. **When unions prioritize protecting bad officers over accountability**, it poisons the whole department. Real consequences must exist for misconduct rather than endless paid suspensions. 
Most of all, locales must recognize that community consent is essential for public safety versus an adversarial occupation. By listening to public demands and coordinating local efforts, neighborhoods proved very capable of defending themselves during a crisis. The path forward rests with collaborative problem-solving and reform, not aggressive policing that only breeds more distrust and escalation.
### Moving Toward a Brighter Future 
While the unrest in 2020 rocked Minneapolis, it also created space to restart community policing from the ground up. By learning from past failures and successes elsewhere, a reimagined approach sensitive to local context could restore trust over time. 
The events starkly highlighted how problematic **governance can become without residents feeling heard**. But they also showed neighbors coming together in solidarity during a crisis. With open democratic participation in the reform process, Minneapolis has a chance to build lasting solutions and become a model for the kind of collaborative public safety others seek to emulate. Progress takes patience and good faith on all sides, but a brighter future remains well within reach.
