## Recovering a Compromised Account
As any Roblox player knows, account security is paramount. Unfortunately accounts can and do get compromised by hackers despite our best efforts. If this happens to you, don't panic - there are steps you can take to try and recover your account.
### Contacting Roblox Support
The first thing to do is contact Roblox support directly. You'll want to gather as much identifying information about your account as possible, such as the email address associated with it, credit card numbers used to purchase Robux, account creation date, and password you last used if you remember it. Having this [account verification data](https://store.fi.io.vn/mommysaurus-mom-mom-2-kids1697-t-shirt) ready will help Roblox determine you are the legitimate owner. 
You can reach out to Roblox support through their website at www.roblox.com/support. Explain what happened clearly and concisely, and provide the verification details requested. Roblox staff will investigate and do their best to verify ownership and resolve the issue. This process can take some time, so be patient as they work to help you regain access.

### Enabling Two-Factor Authentication 
If Roblox support is able to recover your account, one of the most important steps is enabling two-factor authentication right away to better secure it going forward. **Two-factor authentication** adds an extra layer of protection by requiring not just a password but also a code sent to your smartphone or email address when logging in. This makes it much harder for hackers to access your account even if they obtain your password through a phishing scam or data breach. Take the time to set this up immediately after recovering your account for maximal security. 
### Changing Credentials
You'll also want to change your login credentials completely, including both your username and password, to remove any possibility the hacker could regain access. Choose a new, completely unique **strong password** that would be difficult for others to guess. Also consider changing your username to something unrelated to any other online profiles for an added layer of obscurity. With a fresh start and strong security practices in place going forward, you can hopefully avoid account compromise happening again.
## Recovering an Old Deleted Account 
For some, the compromise results in the deletion of their beloved Roblox account rather than just a hijacking. Unfortunately, Roblox has time limits on recovering deleted accounts, so acting quickly is important.
### Contacting Support Within 30 Days 
If the deletion occurred within the last 30 days, contact Roblox support right away with as much identifying information as possible, just like for a compromised account. Provide purchase histories, credit card numbers used, old emails and passwords associated - anything that can verify you as the original owner. Roblox may be able to recover the account if contacted soon enough with solid verification details. 
### Submitting a Delete Appeal Form
For deletions over 30 days ago, you'll need to submit an official delete appeal form available on the Roblox support site rather than just contacting support normally. This involves providing even more thorough account details and ownership evidence for Roblox to thoroughly review. They will determine if there is enough justification to recover the deleted profile based on the appeal. Be prepared to wait as reviews for older deletions take additional time. 
### Considering Account Reinstatement is Rare
Unfortunately, Roblox has stated account reinstatements for deletions over 6 months ago are extremely unlikely due to data purging requirements. The longer time has passed, the more detached the verification data becomes from the original owner. While it doesn't hurt to submit an appeal, have realistic expectations that the further in the past it was, the harder it will be to definitively prove your claim to the once deleted account. Acting promptly is key for the best chances of recovery.
## When Accounts Cannot Be Recovered 
Not all compromised or deleted accounts can be restored, unfortunately. Here are some scenarios where recovery may not be possible:
### Lack of Verification Details
If you do not have access to purchase histories, credit cards used, email addresses associated, or any other ownership verifying data, Roblox has no way to definitively tie the request to the original account holder. Without solid information to back up claims, they cannot reasonably restore access. Having incomplete verification details seriously hinders recovery chances. 
### Significant Time Has Passed 
As mentioned, the longer it has been since the deletion, the harder it becomes to recover the profile. Past a certain point, usually 6+ months, Roblox considers the data too outdated to reinstate with any confidence it's going to the right person. They have to prioritize current data integrity over very aged claims. 
### Multiple Ownership Transfers 
Some compromised accounts end up traded or sold between multiple individuals after being hijacked. This complicates restoration by muddying the waters of definitive original ownership. Roblox may decline attempts to recover accounts with a history of unknown subsequent users. 
### Account was Permanently Banned 
If the profile deletion or lockout was done due to a severe rules violation or illegal behavior rather than hijacking, Roblox support won't lift the penalties. Permanent bans cannot be appealed regardless of any ownership claims if done for policy breaches rather than security issues. 
## Conclusions 
With quick action, thorough verification details, and a little luck, it is certainly possible to recover a compromised or deleted Roblox account in many cases. However, there are also realistic limitations based on time frames and ownership complexities. While disappointing not to have closure, understanding Roblox's account restoration constraints can help set proper expectations for recovery chances in different situations. Taking active steps to bolster security also lessens the risks of it happening again going forward.
