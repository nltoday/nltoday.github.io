## Early Repayment: My Experience
I took an educational loan of around **Rs. 17-18 lacs[ to fund my ](https://yt.io.vn/collection/agnello)MBA at IIM Calcutta** in 2014. Coming from a **non-business background**, this was my first major loan. I was determined to clear it off quickly. 
My starting package post-MBA was **Rs. 16 lacs per annum**. I stayed with my parents, keeping expenses minimal at around **20% of salary**. I funnelled **80%+ of earnings** towards loan repayment. Within 18 months, I had cleared the full amount of **Rs. 18.9 lacs**. Meeting this goal earlier than expected gave me a great sense of relief and freedom.
### Minimal Living & Side Incomes Accelerated Repayment
While most peers chose to drag loans for the maximum period, I wasn't comfortable with long-term debt. Minimal living allowed high savings despite an average package. Side incomes from **freelancing** during weekends boosted repayment power. Staying frugal yet debt-free was very rewarding.

### Benefits of Becoming Debt-Free Early Outweighed Returns  
Financially, it's smarter to repay minimum monthly and earn returns on surplus. However, being untethered from EMIs gave me flexibility to explore new opportunities sooner than expected. The mental peace outweighed potential returns in the long-run for me.
## Tips for Effective Loan Management
### Track Expenses Religiously to Maximize Savings 
Even small daily expenses add up significantly over time. Use expense tracking apps/sheets to identify wasteful spends and focus on necessities only. Saving 20-30% more makes a big difference in repayment schedules.
### Look for Side incomes & Bonuses 
Any additional incomes like performance bonuses, freelance projects or side businesses can be directed entirely towards the loan to boost prepayments. Even small amounts help chip away principal significantly with timely use.
### Stay Motivated with Visual Goals & Deadlines
Set target repayment amounts/deadlines and track physical/virtual progress. Seeing achievement bars fill is rewarding. Share progress regularly with supportive friends/family to stay accountable. Their encouragement keeps the motivation high. 
### Negotiate Repayment Flexibility with Banks  
Banks sometimes allow ad-hoc prepayments or delayed EMI options in certain situations like expected bonuses/increments. It's worth a conversation to maximize repayment power using planned cash inflows prudently.
## Summing Up
With focus, discipline and a bit of creativity, most individuals can clear substantial education loans well within average repayment periods. Reducing debt burdens sooner rather than later allows fresh graduates more scope for personal and professional growth unhindered by financial commitments. Starting one's career debt-free sets the path for true financial independence.
