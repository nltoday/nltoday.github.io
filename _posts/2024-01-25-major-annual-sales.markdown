The largest sales usually occur during the holidays. The winter Steam sale, known commonly as the Winter Sale, usually takes place starting the week before Christmas and lasts for about two weeks. During this sale period, you can expect to find the deepest discounts across all categories of games. Discounts often reach 80% off or more for some titles. As the biggest sale event of the year, it's a great opportunity to pick up games you've been waiting to go on sale. 
Another significant sale happens in the summer. The Summer Sale on Steam also spans approximately two weeks, though discounts may not be quite as steep as during winter. Nonetheless, you can still find many popular games marked down by 50% off or more. Compared to other seasonal sales, selection and discounts remain generous during the summer. It's worthwhile to check out deals during this mid-year event as well.
### Other Regular Sales Throughout the Year
Outside of the major winter and summer sales, you can rely on finding games discounted every week on Steam. Be sure to create a [wishlist of desired titles](https://store.fi.io.vn/cute-axolotl-funny-i-axolotl-questions-salamander-265/women&) to easily see what's on sale that interests you. You can sort your wishlist by discount so the items with the best prices appear at the top. Additionally, enabling notifications will alert you via email or mobile app when something from your wishlist goes on sale. Taking advantage of weekly deals ensures you never miss out on a **good deal on a highly-rated game**. 
Black Friday also delivers some impressive offers, with discounts comparable to or even exceeding what's seen during the winter event. Lasting about a week, it's a brief but bountiful time for savings. Many publishers participate to attract bargains-hunting customers. Keep an eye out during late November for potential Black Friday game deals.

### Content-Specific Mini Sales
In between major seasonal sales, Steam may run targeted promotional sales focused on certain genres, developers, or franchises. For example, a publisher might choose to discount all games in a long-running series. Or a themed sale could highlight different categories like strategy games. These more niche sales don't provide as extensive selections but allow snagging relevant games at reduced prices. Sign up for a Steam account to receive personalized notifications about upcoming sales.
### Checking Player Bases for Online-Only Games
The one potential downside of buying an older online-only game is the risk of finding few active players left. Before purchasing such a title on sale, it's wise to research its current **player base size**. Popular games with dedicated fan bases tend to maintain livelier online communities longer. Look up a title's player counts on sites like Steam Charts or its respective game tracker. This due diligence helps ensure you can actually play multiplayer as intended after choosing a discounted online game.
### Sales Provide Fantastic Value 
In summary, keeping an eye on major seasonal discounts along with weekly and occasional targeted sales gives gamers access to fantastic value. Franchise bundles, complete editions, and individual games all see steep reductions throughout the year. With a little patience and wishlist management, savvy shoppers can build impressive game libraries for bargain prices. Sales continue to be the best way to purchase newly released or classic titles at deeply discounted costs.
