Gaming and online communication platforms play a crucial role in the lives of many, serving not just as entertainment but also as a lifeline for mental wellbeing. However, their value is often misunderstood by those outside these communities. Removal of such platforms without understanding their importance can have severe unintended consequences.
### Friends Beyond Pixels
Massively multiplayer online games like World of Warcraft bring people together in virtual worlds. But behind the pixels are real people forming deep connections. Kahierden, the leader of an in-game guild, exemplified this through his care for others despite his own health issues. Even in his final days, he ensured the wellbeing of his online community. His tragic passing highlighted how digital friendships can feel just as real as offline ones.

### A Community's Grief 
Losing Kahierden was difficult for those who knew him online. They honored his memory the only way available to them - with an in-game vigil. While some may dismiss virtual ties, to the gamers in Disposable Hero guild, Kahierden was genuinely their friend. Deletion of online accounts severs not just access to games but meaningful social bonds for many. 
### A Lifeline for Wellbeing
For those with conditions like PTSD, gaming and online contacts serve as more than just entertainment. They provide crucial social support and a reason to face each day's struggles. Removal of such a "lifeline" risks dangerous consequences like relapse into depression, isolation, and even suicidal thoughts. Rash decisions disrupt carefully maintained mental wellness routines without understanding real impacts.
### Lack of Understanding Fuels Reactions  
Misconceptions about gaming and a lack of effort to comprehend its true value fuel rash overreactions. Assuming it as mindless addiction overlooks therapeutic benefits. Mental health issues are too complex for simplistic fixes. Forcing change without consent damages trust and control essential for recovery. Understanding different perspectives through open communication is key to resolving issues respectfully.
### A Dangerous Precedent of Coercion
My mother's overly coercive "parenting" style stemming from poor comprehension severely harmed my development and mental health. Drastic actions like sudden removals foster anxiety and lack of control rather than solution. They exemplify using power to impose personal views forcefully without consent. This breeds resentment and trauma instead of resolution. Coercion has [no place](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cute-but-psycho-bae-darling-crazy-girlfriend-t-shirt/women&) in caring for someone's wellbeing and future.
### The Responsibility of Understanding
As caretakers, it is our duty to understand what truly matters to our children and why. Making assumptions then reacting without consent breaks that trust. Seeking to grasp another's perspective, even when different, shows care rather than dismissal. Open communication where feelings and fears are shared respectfully helps finds solutions respecting all. Forcing personal views is irresponsible. Only through compassionate understanding can wellbeing be preserved.
### Moving Forward With Care 
Progress requires acknowledging past mistakes and committing to do better. The path forward is open communication to understand issues from all sides followed by cooperative resolution keeping all's wellbeing in mind. Forced change breeds resentment while consented solutions nurture trust. With care, even divisive issues can transform relationships. But first we must be willing to listen with empathy instead of assume with authority. Progress starts within, with care for others' humanity above all else.
