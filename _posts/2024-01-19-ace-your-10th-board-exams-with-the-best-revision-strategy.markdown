Board exams can be really stressful for students. While it's understandable to feel anxious, with the right preparation you can overcome challenges and get excellent scores. This guide will share proven methods to score 95% or higher based on my own experience scoring 97% overall.
### Focus on Understanding Fundamentals
The key is to have a strong grasp of core concepts from your NCERT textbooks. Make revision a regular habit from the start of the academic year rather than last-minute cramming. Read each chapter thoroughly, [underline important definitions and formulae](https://store.fi.io.vn/chihuahuas-best-dog-mom-ever-retro-usa-american-flag-123-chihuahua-dog), and solve all exercise questions to check your understanding. Revisiting topics frequently helps **cement your learning long-term**.

### Master Problem-Solving with Practice
Once you understand fundamentals, practice is paramount. Solve as many previous year and sample papers as possible within time limits to familiarise yourself with exam stress and question patterns. **Target difficult topics first** which require more attempts. Regular practice prevents last-minute surprises and aids **time management during exams**. 
For **Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry**, attempt one subject's papers daily. Analyse missed questions to address gaps. **Prioritise Numerical-type questions** which often carry more marks.
### Leverage Model Question Papers
Carefully study the criteria for evaluating different question types like HOTS, comprehension, case studies etc. Many top-scoring students check model question papers provided by CBSE on their website to gauge probable questions. Identify frequently-tested concepts and **prepare short notes for quick revision**.
### Master Exam Technique
Present legibly with clear thought processes visible. Biology especially rewards neat labelling and **flowcharts for concepts** like plant physiology which can secure full marks despite minor content errors. 
For **descriptive English papers** research previous year topics and draft sample responses to avoid last-minute cobbling. Underline key points for each poem/story **to highlight in responses**.  
### Focus on Scoring Subjects First
Identify your strongest 2-3 subjects which you can score 90% or above in with minimal effort. Give priority coverage to these as **insurance for overall percentage**. Balance time efficiently between subjects according to difficulty levels. 
### Take Practice Tests Frequently
Mock tests simulate real exam pressure and highlight preparation gaps. Time yourself accurately and analyse results. Identify weak topics for more practice. Gradually increase **mock frequency from once a month to weekly as exams near**. Identifying and improving on mistakes is crucial for success.
### Improve Understanding Through Teaching
Explain concepts to siblings, friends or virtually through forums. **Teaching forces you to simplify complex ideas and plug holes in your own knowledge. It also boosts confidence through feedback.** Include visual elements like concept maps, diagrams, tables etc.  
With persistent preparation from the first term itself using these evidence-backed strategies, you can achieve top scores to fulfil your academic dreams. Stay determined and all the best!
