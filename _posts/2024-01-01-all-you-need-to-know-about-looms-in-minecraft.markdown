## Introduction to Looms
Looms are important crafting blocks that were introduced in the Village & Pillage Update. They allow players to craft banner designs and patterns infinitely without consuming any resources. Let's take a deeper look at everything you need to know about looms, from how to obtain them to their various functionalities.
## How to Obtain Looms
### Crafting Looms
To craft a loom, you will need [string](https://yt.io.vn/collection/agnello) and **wood planks**. Place one string in the top middle and top left slot of the crafting grid. Then place two wood planks in the middle column. This will craft you one loom.

### Finding Looms in Villages
Looms can also spawn naturally in villages, specifically inside shepherd houses. Keep an eye out while exploring villages to find looms without having to craft them. 
### Looting Looms from Chests
Rarely, looms may generate as loot inside buried treasure chests, shipwreck chests, abandoned mineshaft chests and other randomly generated chests throughout the world.
## Using Looms to Craft Banner Designs
### Opening the Loom Interface 
Once you have obtained a loom, right click on it to open up its user interface. Here you will see three slots - for a banner, dye and optional banner pattern.
### Applying Banner Patterns
Place a banner in the top slot. Choose a pattern from the center list by left-clicking. If the pattern requires a dye, place it in the middle slot. The bottom slot will preview the designed banner. Take it out to finish crafting infinitely.
## Additional Loom Functionalities
### Changing Villager Professions  
If a village has an **unclaimed loom**, villagers have a chance to become shepherds and link to that loom as their job site block.
### Fuel Source in Furnaces
Placing a loom in a furnace acts as a fuel, smelting 1.5 items which is more efficient than using logs!
## Advanced Loom Features
### Using Specific Banner Patterns
Six patterns like Skull Charge require their corresponding banner pattern items placed in the middle slot to show up in the loom interface. For example, Skull Charge would need a Skull Pattern.
### Sound Generation with Note Blocks  
Placing a loom underneath a note block produces a bass sound when the note block is activated. Experiment with making loom-powered music!
### Rare Uncraftable Loom Variant  
There exists an unobtainable "Empty Potion" loom variant generated by commands. It functions exactly like a regular loom.
## Final Thoughts
Looms add so much more depth to banner crafting and village gameplay. Whether you need to make banner designs, change villager professions or fuel furnaces, looms have very useful applications. Be sure to explore all their features the next time you are playing Minecraft. With looms, crafting beautiful customized banners has never been easier.
