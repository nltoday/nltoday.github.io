Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning types are checked at runtime rather than compile time. This allows for flexibility but can also lead to errors if types are mismatched. In this article, we will explore common runtime errors in Python like TypeError and how to handle them.
### Incorrect Argument Number
One common source of runtime errors is passing the wrong number of arguments to a function. For example:
```python
def my_func(n1, n2):
return n1 + n2
my_func(1, 2, 3) 
```
Here we defined my_func to take two arguments but are calling it with three arguments. 
Under Python 2.7, this would result in a `TypeError` with the message: 
```
TypeError: my_func() takes exactly 2 arguments (3 given)
```
Python 3.7 expresses it slightly differently:
```
TypeError: my_func() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given
```
So in both cases, the error class is `TypeError` due to a type mismatch between the function definition and call. The number and types of arguments must match.

### Incorrect Argument Types
Another common case is passing arguments of the wrong type. For example:
```python 
def add(x, y):
return x + y
add("1", 2)
```
Here we are passing a string "1" where an integer is expected. This would result in a `TypeError` as strings cannot be added to integers.
### Handling Runtime Errors
Since runtime errors cannot be caught at compile time, it is important to add proper error handling. We can catch specific errors using try/except blocks.
For example:
```python
try:
add("1", 2)
except TypeError:
print("Incorrect argument types!")
```
This will print a friendly error message if a TypeError occurs instead of crashing.
We can also catch general exceptions using a bare except:
```python 
try:
# code that may cause errors
except:
print("An unknown error occurred!") 
```
Proper error handling makes programs more robust and prevents crashes.
### Summary
In summary, Python checks types at runtime which provides flexibility but can also lead to errors if types are mismatched. Common runtime errors include TypeError from incorrect argument number, types, or operator usage. These errors can be caught using exception handling to make programs more stable. Taking care with argument passing and adding try/except blocks helps produce high-quality Python code.
