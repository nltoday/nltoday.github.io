Flying a 17-hour flight from Delhi to San Francisco can be a daunting task, especially with all the negative reviews of Air India online. However, despite low expectations, my recent trip revealed Air India economy to offer surprising comforts. In this honest review, I detail my experience flying with Air India, highlighting both positives and one minor negative.
### [Leg Space and Amenities Surpassed Expectations](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/aday)
While long-haul flights are never truly comfortable, I found Air India provided more than adequate legroom in economy. Having flown several top airlines, I've never had such generous space on a long flight. This small difference made a **big difference** in comfort levels over 17 hours. Additional amenities like pillows and blankets further enhanced the journey.

### **Food Quality Surprised and Satisfied** 
Another positively surprising element was the food quality and quantities served. Multiple hearty and tasty meals were provided, far exceeding expectations for economy. The standout for me was the **delicious continental non-vegetarian dish** served, mouthwateringly mouthwatering mutton that hit the spot after hours of flying. Beverages were also generously served to our seats or upon request from attendants.
### **Efficient and Friendly Crew Aided Enjoyment**
While the crew may not have been the most upbeat, they efficiently attended to passengers needs. Over a couple hours, my husband and developed a good rapport, remembering small requests. The passengers also proved pleasant with no disruptions. Positive social interactions enhanced the experience versus a stressful atmosphere.
### **Entertainment Systems Functioned Against Expectations** 
Low expectations were again exceeded regarding the in-flight entertainment systems. While outdated, I was happily surprised to have functioning displays and a library of newer movies. Not being an avid viewer, newer releases like **Padman** provided novelty. This small surprise engagement proved a welcome bonus on such a long flight.
### **Minimal Issue at Delhi Check-In Counter**
The one minor negative came pre-flight at New Delhi check-in. Undergoing extra security screening, I noticed our bags were separated instead of tagged together. Thankfully listening to my intuition, I ensured both bags were correctly checked and loaded. If separated upon arrival, our trip preparation could have been derailed. While a small lapse, sharing can help others potentially avoid similar issues.
### **Smooth Flight and On-Time Arrival** 
Thankfully the actual flight proved smooth with no delays. Landing on time despite weather conditions displayed Air India's operational competence. Avoiding layovers by flying non-stop also saved travel time versus other routes. The seamless flight further demonstrated the airline's reliability and effectiveness for this long-haul sector.
In conclusion, **flying Air India economy from Delhi to San Francisco** turned out to be a surprisingly comfortable experience versus expectations. While not perfect, numerous small touches combined to make the 17-hour journey remarkably manageable. For anyone wishing to avoid layovers on this important route between India to the US, Air India economy deserves consideration beyond its reviews. One flight changed my perception of the airline for the better.
