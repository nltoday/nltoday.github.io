### Entering Your Legacy YouTube Credentials 
On the youtube.com/claim page, you'll see a box labeled "Legacy YouTube username or email" where you can enter the username or email address associated with your legacy YouTube channel. Below this, enter the password for this legacy account.
If you no longer remember the credentials for your legacy account, click the "Forgot username or password?" link. This will guide you through the process of **resetting your legacy YouTube password** by having a password reset link sent to the email address on file. 
After successfully entering your legacy YouTube username and password, click the green "Link these accounts" button to officially connect your legacy channel to your Google Account. This linking process may take a few moments to complete.
### Claiming Your Channel 
Once the accounts have been successfully linked, you'll be redirected to the dashboard page for your legacy YouTube channel. Here, look for a message that says "You can now **claim this channel** by clicking the button below." 
Click the blue "Claim this channel" button to finalize the claiming process. You've now officially **claimed ownership of your legacy YouTube channel** and it will be fully integrated and managed through your Google Account going forward.
### Verifying Channel Ownership
YouTube may require extra verification steps to confirm you are the true owner of the legacy channel before fully transitioning ownership. Common verification methods include having you:
- Provide the billing address or phone number on file for the channel's original creation  
- Answer knowledge-based questions only the original creator would know
- Upload a video to the channel proving access to the associated email address
Follow all provided instructions carefully to quickly verify ownership of the channel. Once verified, the channel will be fully under your control through your linked Google Account.
### Managing Your Claimed Channel
With your legacy YouTube channel now claimed and linked to your Google Account, you can freely manage and update it going forward. You'll have full access to standard YouTube creator tools and settings accessible from your desktop or YouTube mobile app when logged into the associated Google Account. 
Some helpful management tasks include customizing your channel **about section, artwork and playlists**. You can also connect other social profiles for greater visibility and use YouTube analytics to gain insights into viewer demographics and top performing videos. 
By permanently linking your legacy channel to an active Google Account, you ensure it remains under your control and can continue creating and engaging with viewers long into the future. Following these steps to properly claim an abandoned channel is important to maintain ownership of your early YouTube legacy.
### Troubleshooting the Claiming Process
While the channel claiming process is usually straightforward, occasionally issues can arise. Here are some tips to troubleshoot common problems:
- Double check all **login credentials were entered correctly**. Mistypes are a common source of failed claims.
- Make sure the Google Account being used has **never been associated with another YouTube channel previously**. It must be a clean account. 
- Contact YouTube support if verification steps aren't working properly or you're encountering errors. They may need to manually investigate the legacy channel's original owner data. 
- As a last resort, you can try **creating a brand new Google Account** and starting the entire claiming process over from the beginning. Sometimes using a fresh account solves technical glitches.
- Only attempt to claim channels **where you are absolutely certain you are the legitimate original creator**. Disputes over ownership can cause delays.
With patience and by thoroughly reviewing all connection steps, most issues claiming an old YouTube channel can typically be resolved. Don't hesitate to reach out for assistance if problems persist.
### Maintaining Legacy Channel Authority
Once your valuable legacy YouTube channel is firmly under your control through your verified Google Account, focus on maintaining its online authority and legacy. Some strategies to consider include:
- Continue posting **new, high-quality engaging content** on a regular schedule to keep the channel active.
- Link to the channel prominently from all of your websites and social profiles using **channel art, playlists and featured videos**. 
- Consider **migrating older videos to higher resolutions** compatible with today's devices for improved viewing experiences.  
- Use YouTube analytics to identify top performing legacy videos and ** optimize their metadata, descriptions and titles** for better discoverability.
- Reply to any new comments on old videos to maintain an active **community and sense of legacy around the channel**.
With some TLC, even channels dormant for many years can be revived to attract new generations of loyal subscribers. Properly honoring a platform mainstay helps strengthen your reputation as a pioneering online figure.
