### Following the Star
The Magi were a group of astrologers and scholars from lands far to the East. For some time, they had noticed an unusual celestial phenomenon - a bright [new star](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-cow-mom-cute-womens-70s-80s-retro-style-sunset-moo-moo-lover-v-neck-t-shirt/women&) that kept appearing in the night sky. Through their study of the stars and ancient prophecies, they came to believe that this star signified the birth of a **great king** who would rise to power and rule over the Jews. Determined to find this king and pay him homage, the Magi embarked on a long and arduous journey, following the movement of the mysterious star across the desert. 
After many months of travel, the star finally led them to the city of Jerusalem. There, they asked King Herod where they might find the newborn ruler of the Jews, for they wished to honor him as their king. Herod was greatly troubled by their question, as he knew nothing of another king in Judea and felt threatened by this news.

### Receiving Guidance in Jerusalem 
Herod assembled the **Jewish elders** and **scribes** in Jerusalem and asked them where in their scriptures it was written that the Messiah would be born. The scholars told him that the prophet Micah had foretold that the Messiah would be born in the little town of Bethlehem. After speaking further with the Magi, Herod learned that the star had first appeared over two years ago. He sent the Magi off to Bethlehem, instructing them to search diligently for the child and report back when they had found him, so that he too could worship him.
### The Journey Resumes
After leaving Jerusalem, the star reappeared ahead of the Magi to guide their way. It led them south to the small town of Bethlehem. As they made their way through the streets, the star stopped and remained fixed over a particular house. Overjoyed at the fulfillment of their mission, the Magi entered the home and found a young boy with his mother Mary. They fell to their knees before him and opened their treasured gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh to offer to the child.
### The Gifts Bestowed
Each gift carried profound significance. Gold was fitting for a king, frankincense for God, and myrrh, an aromatic balm used in burial rites, foretold the child's future suffering. Although the Magi could not have fully understood who this peculiar infant truly was, their gifts acknowledged Jesus as the son of God and king, as well as one who would die. Their act of worship and offering of rich presents showed that these foreign scholars had recognized the spiritual and royal identity of the humble peasant child. 
In this way, the Magi became the first **Gentile** believers to pay homage to Christ and bring gifts to honor him long before his full identity as **Savior** would be revealed. Their long journey following the mysterious star was a shining example of obedience, faith and worship that has inspired Christians across the centuries.
