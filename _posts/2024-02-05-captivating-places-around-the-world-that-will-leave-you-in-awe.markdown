Located in southern Siberia, [Lake Baikal](https://yt.io.vn/collection/abril) is considered the oldest lake in the world at 25 million years old. It contains 20% of the world's unfrozen surface water. The immense lake is over 5,387 feet deep in some areas and is surrounded by towering cliffs and rocky shorelines. What makes this lake truly unique is its crystal clear **turquoise waters**. The combination of the mineral content and great depth allow sunlight to penetrate deep underwater, illuminating intricate underwater landscapes filled with unique endemic species found nowhere else. Spending a day kayaking along the shoreline offers breathtaking views and a chance to spot roaming wildlife like ibex mountain goats leaping across the cliffs.
