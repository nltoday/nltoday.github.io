### Finding Connection
After being sent to county jail while fighting a lengthy prison sentence, John was deeply afraid of living the rest of his life without any human connection. Seeking comfort and friendship, John started writing letters to several women on the outside in hopes of finding a pen pal. Though most connections faded with time, one relationship stuck - his friendship with Bee.
After exchanging a few initial letters, Bee failed to respond for six months. Feeling disappointed but determined, John wrote Bee again to let her know he was there if she ever wished to resume their correspondence. To his surprise and delight, Bee wrote back shortly after. Over the following years, through many location changes as their sentences progressed, John and Bee maintained their bond solely through the written word.

After finally obtaining freedom, John and Bee found themselves residing in separate counties now too far apart to feasibly live as envisioned. John struggled with unstable housing and another arrest while Bee had started a successful new family. Though their circumstances diverged down unforeseen paths, John remained sincerely happy for Bee's wellbeing and proud of her accomplishments since their years corresponding as pen pals.
### Maintaining the Connection

Though contact lessened at times, John still thinks fondly of Bee and the role she played in helping him survive his sentence with some semblance of hope and humanity. 
Even years after their release, John and Bee hoped to finally meet in person that coming summer. While logistics could interfere, their friendship built on trust and mutual understanding through a lifetime of correspondence provides reassurance that their meaningful connection will continue. John looks forward to seeing Bee and cherishes what they built together against incredible odds - a testament to the power of opening one's self to form genuine relationships, even from afar, during the most isolating of experiences.
