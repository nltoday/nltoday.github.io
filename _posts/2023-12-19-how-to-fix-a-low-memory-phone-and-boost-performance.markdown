## When Low Phone Memory Warning Appears
A low phone memory warning typically shows up when the internal storage of a smartphone reaches 95-98% capacity. Most phones have memory chip sizes ranging from 64GB, with around 6GB reserved for the operating system. So if a phone has a 64GB capacity, the user would be left with about 58GB of available storage. Once around 57GB of that storage is used up, the low memory warning starts appearing. 
The amount of storage that triggers the warning can vary between different phone models and manufacturers. But generally, it indicates the phone's internal memory is almost full. Keeping at least 2GB of free space is recommended to avoid performance issues. With under 250MB (0.25GB) free, some apps may have trouble functioning properly - [video recording applications](https://store.fi.io.vn/play-well-with-others-otter-lover-animal-marine-biologist-1) in particular may only allow 10 seconds of recording before stopping due to insufficient space.
### Why Storage Space Affects Performance
When a phone's internal storage nears maximum capacity, it can negatively impact the device's performance in several ways:
- **Application updates may fail** or not install correctly if there isn't enough free space available temporarily during the download and installation process. Outdated apps are more prone to crashes and bugs.
- The user has limited ability to freely install new apps, photos, videos and other content to the phone as almost every action requires deleting something to make room. This restrictive experience impacts usability. 
- The phone's processor, memory and storage system have to work much harder to manage the limited remaining free space. This extra workload places greater strain on the hardware and leads to more frequent lags, stutters and delays.

### # Steps to Clear Space and Boost Performance
To help remedy a low internal storage situation and enhance a phone's performance, there are some techniques that can be employed:
1. Use the phone's file manager to view hidden files and folders if the option is available. Then navigate to the DCIM folder where photos and videos are usually stored. Look for an oddly named folder like "Thumbnails" - this folder contains small preview files and can usually be deleted entirely to free up several megabytes of storage with no impact.
2. When uninstalling apps, force stop the application first before removing it. This ensures any cached temporary files are deleted. The app's dedicated storage area can then be wiped clean by clearing the app data as well. Uninstalling alone may otherwise leave residual files behind. 
3. For large video files that aren't needed long term, utilize a **video compression app** like "Video Panda Compress & Share" to shrink file sizes dramatically with little quality loss. This is a great way to free gigabytes of storage for bigger files. 
4. Move photos to cloud storage or a computer if they aren't needed on the phone regularly. Google Photos and Dropbox both support automatic high quality **photo backup** from smartphones with free storage tiers.
5. Delete old messages, unused app data, cache files, and unused emails to scrub away storage space consumed by redundant files. Clearing cached browser data periodically also helps reduce bloat.
6. Consider periodically using the phone's built-in "Storage" tools to identify apps consuming disproportionately large amounts of storage. Oftentimes games or multimedia editing apps are the biggest offenders. Uninstalling seldomely used large apps can gain back significant amounts of storage.
So in summary - cleaning up hidden system files, thoroughly uninstalling apps, compressing videos, offloading photos to the cloud, and sweeping general cached junk files are effective methods to free internal memory and boost a low storage phone's speed and reliability. Keeping a couple gigabytes of headroom ensures the phone runs at optimal performance.
### What to Do if a Backup Fails
Even after implementing storage cleaning techniques, it's possible a phone may have become so full that backup and offloading methods fail partway through as well. If a backup attempt fails prematurely with just a portion of the data exported, here are some potential solutions:
- Immediately power down the phone and power it back on. This resets temporary memory caches and buffers that may be blocking the transfer. Try the backup again right away before space runs out.
- Temporarily move the largest files like videos or zip folders of photos to a computer manually via USB cable to free up a bit more room. Then try restarting the backup. 
- As a last resort, consider removing some cache folders like in the DCIM Thumbnails method above, or uninstalling apps that haven't been opened in weeks/months to eke out that tiny bit of extra storage needed. 
- Contact phone manufacturer support - in very low storage situations, they may have special backup tools that optimize storage usage better or can advise alternate methods.
- Worst case, manually transfer the most important photos, videos, contacts and any other must-have files individually. Leave other items for a later full backup once storage is properly cleaned and expanded if needed.
The key is to free up storage incrementally until backup can complete. And as always, ensure backups are stored safely in multiple locations offline too if critical personal data is involved. With patience and trial and error, it's usually possible to still export user files even from a nearly full phone.
### Expanding Phone Storage with MicroSD Cards 
For phones that support microSD card expansion, installing a higher capacity memory card provides an effective way to drastically boost available storage and resolve low memory issues long term. Most newer Android phones have this option, as well as some iPhones depending on model and year. 
MicroSD cards now come in sizes up to 1TB, though 128GB-256GB options provide ample space for thousands of photos, hours of HD videos, and dozens of large apps - at a very affordable price point. Setup is simply a matter of inserting the card into the phone's dedicated memory card slot.
Some key benefits of using a microSD include:
- Freeing up internal storage for system files and key apps that require higher speeds 
- Ability to **seamlessly store and access** all media and download content on the microSD without clogging internal storage
- MicroSD cards are **hot-swappable**, allowing easy swapping between devices or backup without special tools.
- Massive storage capacities for minimal cost - the price per gigabyte is much lower vs internal storage upgrades.
For phones unable to read/write to external cards, wireless transfer methods become important. But a microSD remains the most straightforward and universal solution to permanently fix low internal memory issues on most Android and some iOS devices through hardware expansion. Combined with regular storage maintenance, it ensures optimal phone performance for years.
### Summary
In summary, there are both software and hardware methods to remedy a low storage phone. Through cleaning hidden system files, thoroughly uninstalling unused apps, removing cache folders, compressing large media, offloading to cloud/desktop storage, and using microSD card expansion - it's possible to fix performance problems and prevent future storage warnings. With careful maintenance of available space through these techniques, even phones with tiny capacities can continue operating at their full speed potential.
