## Lock Certain Chats with Biometric Authentication or Password
WhatsApp has introduced a new way for users to secure sensitive conversations. Users can now lock particular chats using biometrics like fingerprint or face recognition on supported devices. For devices that don't support biometrics, a password can be used instead. 
When a chat is locked, it will be kept separately from other chats. The name and message preview of the locked chat will be hidden. Users will need to authenticate with their biometric or password before they can view the messages within the locked chat. 
This provides an extra layer of protection for sensitive conversations, keeping them private even if someone gains access to the user's phone. The locked chat and its contents will remain encrypted until the user authenticates to unlock and view it.
### Secure Private Messages from Unauthorized Access
The ability to lock specific chats with biometrics or passwords gives users more granular control over protecting their private conversations on WhatsApp. Previously, users could only lock their entire WhatsApp app behind a passcode or fingerprint. But locking individual chats provides a simpler solution for securing only the discussions a user deems sensitive. This allows accessing other general chats without additional authentication steps.

### Easy yet Effective Way to Safeguard Valuable Discussions  
Setting up a chat lock on WhatsApp is straightforward. Users simply need to select the chat they want to lock, then enable the "Lock Chat" option. From then on, they will be prompted for authentication like fingerprint scanning each time they want to view that chat's messages. For those without biometric capabilities, a numeric password can be set instead. Overall, chat locks offer an easy and effective way to safeguard sensitive work discussions, financial details, relationship conversations and more on WhatsApp.
## Leave Groups Silently
The platform lets users exit groups quietly without notifying other members, excluding the group admin. This helps avoid potential awkwardness or issues that may arise from a public announcement of leaving.

Leaving groups silently avoids drawing unnecessary attention when a user wants to reduce notifications or drop out of conversations they no longer actively participate in. They can now discretely exit without any fanfare that may invite questions from other participants about their reasons for departing. 
### Spare Users from Potential Explanations 
In certain culturally conservative communities, publicly signalling that one has departed a group can invite speculation about relationships or social dynamics. The silent exit option helps users depart groups while maintaining privacy over their reasons for doing so. This spares them potentially uncomfortable social situations where explanations may be expected.
## Hide Online Status from Specific Contacts
Building on the ability to select who can see a user's last seen status, WhatsApp is working on an option to hide online presence as well from select contacts. 
### **Control Visibility with Granular Privacy Settings**
The additional control over online status continues WhatsApp's approach of providing granular privacy options. It allows users to decide on a contact-by-contact basis who can see when they are online rather than an all-or-nothing approach. Finely tuned settings respect user privacy preferences.
### **Hide Availability from Prying Eyes** 
For users concerned about excessive contact or stalking, the ability to hide online access selectively is important. It helps avoid potentially awkward or stressful interactions by preventing certain contacts from knowing the precise moments a user is actively using WhatsApp. Overall availability remains private and on one's own terms.
## Block Screenshots for View Once Messages 
WhatsApp is testing a feature to prevent screenshots of view once messages that disappear after being seen. This amps up security of ephemeral media shared privately through the platform.
### **Strengthen Security of Sensitive Media**
Sensitive photos and videos require assurance they won't be retained or distributed without consent. The screenshot lock for view once messages effectively gives the same security as sending images through encrypted messaging apps. It ensures view once media is truly fleeting and can't be saved without the sender's permission through unauthorized capturing.
### **Encourage Trust in Private Sharing**
Preventing recipients from screenshotting view once messages boosts user confidence in privately sharing sensitive content like risqu√© images knowing they won't be stored longterm. The screenshot lock encourages using WhatsApp's view once feature without worries of unauthorized distribution, respecting the sender's intention of a temporary viewing experience. Over time, it may lead to even more intimate sharing through the platform between trusted connections.
In summary, the new privacy protections coming to WhatsApp delivers valuable new ways to secure sensitive conversations and media sharing through granular controls. Features like chat locks, silent group exits and selective online hiding maintain privacy while discreetly customizing the user experience. Combined with screenshot blocking for view once messages, these options reinforce trust in privately communicating through WhatsApp.
