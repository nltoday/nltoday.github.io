Managing Discord servers effectively requires keeping track of members, including those who may be offline. While Discord itself does not provide a direct way to view offline users, there are several workarounds server owners and admins can use.
## Server Size Determines Display 
As the original question mentioned, smaller Discord servers under 1000 members will list offline users below the online members in the main member list. **Larger servers face bandwidth and hosting constraints, so offline users are not visible here to preserve resources.** Regardless of server size, admins can always check server logs, member profiles, or use third-party solutions to monitor who is online.
### Check Server Settings 
The member list within server settings provides the most straightforward way on smaller servers. To access it, owners and admins click the server name, then go to **Settings > Members**. Here you can see all accounts, with offline displayed after online users. Server settings offer a quick glance without additional setup.

### Utilize Bot Commands
Bots like Dyno and Carl-bot offer expanded functionality beyond base Discord features. Once added to a server, certain bot commands will retrieve and display offline member names. For example, Dyno uses "!offline" to list usernames inactive for a set number of days. Carl-bot has similar functionality. **This "bot overlay" solution works for any server size.**
## Third-Party Apps Provide Dedicated Views
Some third-party apps focus specifically on server administration and moderation tools. Apps like Galaxy, Nadeko, and Maestro have dashboard features showing online/offline statuses at a glance. **Admins gain central monitoring without cluttering server channels.** However, these come with security and privacy tradeoffs to consider. Only install from trusted developers after reviewing permissions needed.
### Check Member Profiles Individually 
While not as streamlined as other options, admins can still monitor individuals. Click any member name to access profiles, noting the last seen date/time. Over time, lack of recent activity potentially flags offline accounts. This profile inspection works for all servers but isn't suited for bulk checking. 
### Review Server Logs
Server logs record member join/leave events along with status changes. Filters allow isolating entries by date range or username. Reviewing logs provides a retrospective view of who was online when. However, logs don't provide real-time statuses and require extra parsing of date/time data. 
## Balancing Functionality and Privacy 
As community managers, server owners aim to foster engagement while respecting members' privacy. Viewing offline statuses helps address issues directly, but listing inactive users risks appearing intrusive. The optimal method depends on server culture and member agreement on expectations. Clear communication of admin tools fosters understanding on both sides.
Overall, a variety of options exist beyond Discord's baseline features. Choosing methods thoughtfully helps maintain the delicate balance between functionality and privacy that builds trust within communities. With practice, server owners can develop monitoring strategies tailored appropriately for their unique situations.
