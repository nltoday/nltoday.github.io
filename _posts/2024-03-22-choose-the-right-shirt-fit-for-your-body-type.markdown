### Are You a Fitted or Oversized Shirt Person?
The choice between fitted and oversized shirts ultimately depends on personal preference and the desired look. Both styles can be fashionable and can be appropriate for different occasions. Fitted shirts are designed to closely hug the body and are meant to be worn close to the skin. They can create a more streamlined, polished, and formal look, and are often a good choice for more formal occasions such as work or events. However, if the shirt is too tight, it can be uncomfortable and restrict movement. Oversized shirts, on the other hand, are intentionally larger than the wearer's body and are meant to be worn loose and flowy. They can create a relaxed, casual, and comfortable look, and are often a good choice for more casual occasions such as weekends or casual get-togethers. However, if the shirt is too large, it can make the wearer look smaller and overwhelmed by the fabric. Ultimately, the best choice will depend on the individual's body type, the occasion, and the desired aesthetic. Both fitted and oversized shirts can be stylish and fashionable when worn in the right context.

### Fitted Shirts Flatter Hourglass and Athletic Body Types
People with an [hourglass body type](https://store.fi.io.vn/xmas-holiday-party-this-is-my-bernard-dog-christmas-pajama-2) or **athletic body type** often look their best in fitted shirts. An hourglass body type refers to a body that has a proportionate bust, narrow waist, and flared hips. Fitted shirts that hug the curves of the bust, waist, and hips can accentuate this feminine and attractive silhouette. Athletic body types tend to have broad shoulders, muscular arms, and a chiseled torso. Fitted shirts worn skin tight allow the muscular physique to be accentuated in a flattering way. The tailored fit displays subtle muscle definition without appearing overbearing. **Fitted button-down shirts** are a wardrobe staple for these body types and suitable for both professional and casual wear. 
### Oversized Shirts Work Well for Pear and Straight Body Types
Those with a **pear body type** or **straight body type** tend to find oversized shirts most flattering for their figures. Pear-shaped refers to a body that has a larger lower half than upper, with wider hips and thighs. An oversized top balanced the lower half and creates a long, lean silhouette. Straight body types have narrow shoulders and hips that are about the same width as the bust and waist. Oversized blouses float gracefully over the straight lines without clinging too tightly. **Oversized graphic tees** and **oversized linen shirts** allow the eye to flow up and down the body for an elongated look. These looser fits suit casual settings.
### Bodycon and Form-fitting for Hourglass, Athletic and Top-heavy Figures 
For those with clearly defined curves like an hourglass or athletic build, or who are top-heavy, **bodycon dresses** and form-fitting styles can be incredibly flattering. Bodycon refers to figure-hugging clothing that molds to the body's curves. For hourglass and athletic figures, a bodycon dress enhances the nipped-in waist and fits closely over curves without gapping. Those with larger busts feel supported in bodycon styles that lift and separate without gaping. For evening events and going-out attire, nothing accentuates a curvy physique better than a form-fitting dress. Opt for stretchy fabrics like spandex or jersey that move with the body.
### Boyfriend and Relaxed Silhouettes Flatter Bottom-heavy and Straight Figures
Those with bottom-heavy figures including pears or apples, or straighter silhouettes, look amazing in relaxed-fitting and boyfriend styles. Boyfriend silhouettes refer to oversized cuts that are baggier and looser fitting rather than tight or skin-hugging. Items like **boyfriend jeans**, **oversized blazers**, and **baggy trousers** balance out wider hips and thighs. The loose fit creates flow and draws the eye upwards. Those with straighter silhouettes can wear relaxed blouses untucked over trousers for an on-trend relaxed aesthetic. Boyfriend styles flatter without clinging in an unflattering way, making them ideal for casual weekend looks.
### Tailored Separates Work for Hourglass and Athletic Types in Professional Settings
For hourglass and athletic figures in professional contexts such as business wear, tailored separates allow curves to be shown without being overly revealing or tight. Well-fitted trousers or skirts worn with tailored blazers create a polished, put-together appearance. Dress pants hug curves in all the right places while blazers nipped in at the waist maintain a professional decorum. Opt for fabrics like wool, linen or chiffon blends that have movement but don't cling too tightly. **Tailored trousers** with creases, a pressed **button-down shirt**, fitted **blazer** or fitted **sheath dress** flatter shapely figures appropriately for work settings. 
### Loosen Up with Blouses and Cardigans in Smart-casual Settings
For smart-casual occasions like client meetings, looser blouses, blazers or cardigans can create a polished yet relaxed look. Those with straight, apple or pear shapes look flawless when they **layer loose blouses** or **tunics** tucked into pants or worn over skirts. Opt for blouse silhouettes that float over the body rather than cling. Throwing on an **open-front cardigan** creates visual interest while balancing wider lower halves. Hourglass and athletic figures can pair well-fitted trousers with billowing blouses tucked in at the waist for a balanced silhouette. Loose top layers maintain professionalism while allowing more freedom of movement than form-fitting tops.
### Flowing Maxi Dresses and Jumpsuits Flatter All Figures 
Ultimately, no piece flatters all figures quite like a flowing maxi dress or loose jumpsuit. Maxi dresses and jumpsuits that have an loose, easy fitment and airy fabrics like linen, chiffon or jersey look amazing on any body type. The floor-length hemline creates a long lean line whether one is curvy, straight or anywhere between. Billowing maxis and jumpsuits in bold prints, stripes or solids skim over curves without being overly tight or loose. They pair well with flats, heels, minimal jewelry and sunglasses for a effortlessly chic casual ensemble. For easy yet stylish resort-wear or traveling outfits, maxi dresses and jumpsuits are unbeatable.
