### Better Options to Download Private Instagram Videos
After the recent Instagram updates that restricted downloading videos from private accounts, many users have been looking for better options. While you [cannot directly download private videos anymore](https://store.fi.io.vn/womens-pitbull-mom-funny-valentines-day-dog-lovers-bully-pitty-1-3), there are still some workaround methods you can try. 
One option is to ask the account owner to share the video with you directly. Many people are willing to share if it's for personal use. However, this relies on the cooperation of the account owner so it may not always work.
Another alternative is to try screenshotting the video. On Android, you can use built-in screen recording features or third-party screenshot apps to record the video playing. On iOS, you'll need a third-party screen recording app since iOS doesn't allow native screen recording. The quality won't be as good as the original but it's better than nothing.

### Online Tools for Downloading Public Instagram Videos 
If the video is public, you have more options to download it directly without asking the owner. The most common way is to use an **online Instagram video downloader tool**. These tools work by accessing the public video URL and converting it to a downloadable MP4 format.
Some reliable tools include **Keepflick**, **VidPaw**, and **Savetogram**. They provide a simple interface where you just need to paste the video URL and click download. The conversion and download typically takes only a few seconds on a fast internet connection. These tools are also **completely free to use** without any watermarks or file size limits.
### Key Things to Consider When Choosing a Tool
When looking for an Instagram video downloader tool, there are a few important factors to consider:
- **Ease of use** - The interface should be intuitive with only basic copy-paste required. Avoid overly complicated tools.
- **Download speed** - Faster conversion and file size optimization is better for larger videos.
- **File formats** - MP4 is standard but some also support AVI,MOV etc. based on your device compatibility. 
- **Download quality** - Higher resolution and bitrate retained after conversion is ideal. 
- **Platform support** - Make sure it works on your device's operating system like Windows, MacOS, Android etc. 
- **Privacy and security** - Check for HTTPS encryption and no suspicious data collection policies.
Doing your research on these parameters will help you identify the most suitable tool for reliable Instagram video downloads.

- **Savetogram**: Sleek minimal design and auto formats to MP4. However, conversion speed could be faster. 
- **DownloaderForInstagram**: Comprehensive tool that also lets you download photos. But video quality could be better.  
- **DownloaderGram**: Smaller player base but gets basic job done without issues. May have occasional glitches.
