Quora's personalized feed aims to surface topics and questions that pique your interests. However, it's not uncommon for some unwanted topics to end up crowding your homepage. Thankfully, there are a few things you can do to gain more control over your Quora feed.
### Adjust Your Profile Settings  
Your profile details play a significant role in determining the types of questions Quora recommends. Take some time to review the topics you're currently following and unfollow anything irrelevant. You may also want to scrub through past answers and remove any that were only offhand contributions. Double check that no horoscope or astrology related topics are marked as your interests. Tweaking these profile preferences helps Quora better understand your true areas of curiosity.
Quora's algorithms analyze a wide range of signals from your account history to surface timely recommendations. By paring down followed topics and past answers, you reduce noise in the data informing these predictions. The platform can then focus on topics that align closer with your authentic interests.

### Directly Mute Unwanted Topics
If certain topics like horoscopes, Marvel movies or British humor keep popping up despite limited engagement, it may be time to directly mute them. Navigating to the topic pages for astrology, horoscopes and related umbrella categories allows muting with a single click. Remember to also mute similar sounding niche topics that Quora may have grouped them under. 
[Muting horoscope and astrology topics](https://store.fi.io.vn/funny-boxer-s-lovers-tee-canophilia-s-outfitpet-boxer-dog), in particular, ensures future questions on planetary alignments and your zodiac sign compatibility won't clog your feed. You maintain full access to explore other areas of interest without these recurrent distracters. The platform respects your muting preferences to offer a cleaner, more personalized stream of engaging questions.
### Manage Topic Follows And Downvotes Carefully  
According to some users, downvoting every horoscope question they see over the past few weeks did more harm than good. By interacting through downvotes, it inadvertently strengthened the impression that astrology held their attention. **Quora's interest algorithms took these downvotes as a sign** to continue surfacing similar topics. 
The best approach is to avoid all engagement, positive or negative, with topics you wish to exclude. Neither following irrelevant topics nor downvoting related questions communicates disinterest accurately to the recommendation system. For clean filtering, stick to directly muting unattractive subjects from your feed and profile settings.
### Double Check Profile Topics And Answers 
Another factor determining feed curation involves topics marked under your profile profile and past answers left on questions. Even responding to a single astrology inquiry leaves an imprint that astrological phenomena fit into your areas of interest. Take a moment to audit both your profile settings and past answers for any anomalies influencing unwanted recommendations. 
Clearing such content presents a truer picture of your authentic preferences to the platform. With an accurate interests profile, Quora can better focus on thought-provoking questions from subjects that genuinely spark your mental curiosity. A tidy digital footprint fosters more relevant questioning to discover through each feed refresh.
# Optimizing For More Engaging Discussions 
While muting plays a key role in excluding topics, there's also value in actively informing Quora of your preferred spheres. Following domains you find stimulating provides positive guidance for quality question matching. Engaging briefly but meaningfully with queries across diverse subjects expands the range of your interests on record.
### Signal Favored Topics Through Select Following
To fill the space vacated by muted topics, consider selectively adding to your followed categories. Browsing Quora's topic universe reveals countless fascinating niches plus umbrella fields with depth. Make use of the follow feature to bookmark sections holding intellectual value for you.
**Following topics like science, history, arts or personalized lists** related to hobbies communicates positive preference. Quora picks up these signals to display correlated questions alongside your automatic exclusions. A balanced mix of muted exclusions and followed interests shape the most inspiring feed.
### Sparingly Answer Compelling Questions  
While limiting past responses helps declutter influence from unusable history, thoughtful contributions also play an important role. Occasionally taking the time to answer questions you're uniquely qualified to address provides valuable context. Quality over quantity proves most useful - just a few select answers per month add dimension without noise. 
Subjects like travel, philosophy, current events or personal areas of study invite informed perspectives. Well written responses to **questions within your demonstrated spheres of expertise** reinforces related topics for discovery. They also foster deeper discussions beneficial to the broader Quora community.
### In Summary
With a few adjustments, you can curate a Quora feed focused on topics that genuinely spark your mental curiosity. Directly muting unwanted subjects provides the cleanest filtering while selectively following and engaging sets a foundation for quality matches. Together, these optimizations yield a personalized stream ideal for expanding your knowledge and perspectives through thoughtful questioning.
