### Addressing Multiple Male Recipients
If you know you are writing to multiple male recipients, you can use "Sirs," as the greeting. While "Dear" is commonly used in greetings, it is arguably best reserved for addressing those closest to you on a more personal level. "Sirs" respectfully addresses the group in a formal context. 
### Addressing Multiple Recipients Including Male and Female
For a group containing both male and female recipients, the polite greetings to use are "Sirs and Madam" or "Sirs and Ma'am." This acknowledges both the male and female recipients in the letter's greeting. 
### Addressing Multiple Female Recipients 
Addressing a letter exclusively to multiple female recipients, you have a few respectful options. One is to use "Ladies" as the greeting. Another is to opt for a non-gendered greeting like "Greetings" which is inclusive of all potential readers.

In conclusion, while **formal letter greetings** may seem like a minor detail, establishing an appropriate tone through your choice of greeting helps your message be received respectfully by all intended readers. The body of the letter ultimately contains the key information, but a greeting sets the right framework for professional communication.
### Preference Versus Practicality 
While individual preferences vary in communication styles, it is important to consider your target audience and aim for an objective standard of courtesy when composing formal correspondence. Those demanding precise etiquette would likely take issue with an overly casual tone even if was well-intentioned. Therefore, defaulting to more traditional greetings ensures nobody can reasonably find offense, allowing the focus to remain on the substantive message being conveyed. Minor conventions matter little between close colleagues who understand each other, but establishing rapport starts by accommodating diverse standards of formality upfront. Practical professionalism serves relationships best in the end.  
In summary, some flexibility exists depending on reader familiarity, but defaulting to greetings with broader acceptance provides a safe starting point for respectful dialogue on any issue. Substance always takes priority, so keeping etiquette unobtrusive allows true understanding to naturally develop over time.
