My 10th board exam marks and some memorable experiences from that time. 
### Receiving my Results
I secured an overall percentage of 81.2% in my 10th board exams conducted by CBSE. 
English — 80 Marks/100 Marks
Sanskrit — 88 Marks/100 Marks 
Mathematics — 87 Marks/100 Marks
Science — 79 Marks/100 Marks
Social Science — 72 Marks/100 Marks
Total — 406 Marks/500 Marks
I was relieved to see that I had passed all subjects, especially [Sanskrit language exam](https://store.fi.io.vn/mommysaurus-mom-mom-2-kids3091-t-shirt).

### Preparing for Maths Exam  
Mathematics was always my strongest subject. I had solved RD Sharma textbook **twice thoroughly** in preparation. However, I couldn't complete the paper on exam day due to **lack of time management skills**. 
### Love for Social Science Subject   
Social Science was my favorite subject to study due to interest in history and politics. However, my **poor cursive handwriting** resulted in lower scores compared to other subjects. Time ran short in this exam too.
### Last Minute Hall Ticket Drama
On the day of **Sanskrit language examination**, I forgot my hall ticket at home. Had to take an auto rickshaw back home to collect it in a rush. Thankfully my father drove me back to school on time.
### Lessons from a Caring Teacher
I had joined **mathematics tutorial classes** in 10th grade. My tuition teacher taught me important life lessons about treating students with respect, beyond the math formulas. 
### Teaching the Next Generation
Today I teach engineering students and apply interpersonal skills learned from my **dedicated math tuition teacher**. Passing onvalues to the next generation is most rewarding.
