## My Grandmother's Wise Words
I still remember the conversation I had with my grandmother years ago before her passing. At the time, I didn't really understand what she meant when she told me "you're too nice" and that "people like me don't do well in the world." 
### [Being a People Pleaser](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/alaimo) 
As a child, I was always concerned with what others thought about me. I had a deep need for outer acceptance because I didn't fully embrace myself. I thought if I just avoided controversy and did my best to please everyone around me, I'd feel safe and wanted. So that's what I became - the nice guy who let other people come first and sacrificed my own wellbeing.

### **Living Unhappily**
For years, I put other's needs above my own. I was miserable but didn't know how to change. I bottled up my feelings and dismissed my grandmother's words, thinking she didn't know what she was saying due to her Alzheimer's. Looking back, I realize she saw through me and was just trying to warn me that this people-pleasing path would not lead to happiness or success.
## Finding My Inner Strength  
Things started shifting a few years ago when I decided it was time to prioritize myself more. I realized I didn't have to be a doormat or lose my kind nature to stand up for myself. 
### **Taking Control of My Life**
I began asserting my worth at work by negotiating fair pay instead of letting employers take advantage. I also started martial arts training to build confidence in myself physically and mentally. No longer would I accept disrespect or allow people to mistreat me.
### **Healing and Forgiving** 
I made strides in my personal growth too. I stopped complaining about past hurts and forgave those who wronged me. This reduced resentment and lifted a weight off my shoulders. Journaling helped process emotions, while meditation brought more inner peace.
## A New Chapter Unfolds
My life has transformed dramatically since learning to put myself first without losing my compassion for others. I feel genuinely happy and empowered.
### **Thriving as My Authentic Self**
By embracing who I am internally, I express myself freely without fear of displeasing people or controversy. This authenticity attracts high quality relationships where I give and receive mutual care and respect. My career is also flourishing as I confidently advocate for myself. 
### **Wisdom Realized Too Late**  
Sadly my grandmother passed before seeing me become my best self, but I now understand the wisdom in her words. She knew putting others' needs above my own wellbeing would only lead to unhappiness. I regret not heeding her advice sooner but am grateful the lessons still reached me in the end. Her memory inspires me to keep prioritizing self-care and speaking my truth courageously.
## Continuing the Journey
My transformation involved small consistent changes over many years rather than overnight. There is always room for more growth, and life presents ongoing opportunities to strengthen my character.
### **Maintaining Self-Respect**
Now that I respect myself, others are also more likely to treat me with dignity. However, I must remain diligent about boundaries and not backslide into people-pleasing ways. Self-care will always be a priority. 
### **Passing on Life's Lessons**  
Just as my grandmother guided me, I hope to mentor others with what I've learned. Her legacy lives on through me as I encourage finding inner security, setting boundaries respectfully and chasing fulfillment instead of outer validation. My journey isn't over, and I aim to keep honoring her memory.
