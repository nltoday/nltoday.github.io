### Verifying Recovery Media
The first thing you should check is the recovery media you are using for the reset. Make sure that the USB drive or DVD containing your Windows recovery files is not corrupted. If you created the recovery media yourself, it's a good idea to recreate it to rule out any issues with the media.

### Using Official Installation Media  
For the best results, you should use official Windows installation media directly from Microsoft if possible. You can create a bootable USB drive with the latest Windows 8.1 files using the Windows Media Creation Tool. Be sure to select the exact version and edition of Windows 8.1 that matches your product key, such as **Windows 8.1 Pro**.
### Checking for Hardware Problems
Hardware issues on your system could potentially cause the "not valid" error. It's a good idea to run built-in hardware diagnostics or third-party diagnostic tools to check for any problems with components like your hard drive or RAM. Addressing underlying **hardware errors** may help resolve installation issues.
### Verifying Your Product Key
Double check that you are entering the correct Windows product key if prompted during setup. An invalid or incorrect key can definitely lead to validation errors. Make sure the product key matches the **edition of Windows 8.1** you are trying to install. 
### Optimizing BIOS/UEFI Settings  
The boot order configuration in your computer's BIOS or UEFI could also be a factor. Ensure it is set to first boot from the installation media, such as a USB drive. The boot sequence varies by manufacturer, so check your motherboard manual for guidance on properly setting **BIOS boot priority**.
### Creating Fresh Installation Media
If recovery media is ruled out as the problem, your next step should be making new installation media. Follow Microsoft's documentation carefully to create a bootable USB or DVD using the official Windows 8.1 ISO file. Building installation media from scratch on a different drive may solve the validation issue.
### Downloading the Windows ISO  
As a last resort, you can download the Windows 8.1 installation files directly from Microsoft to create custom installation media. Be sure to get the ISO for the specific version and edition of Windows matching your product key. Using official Microsoft installation media created from the legitimate ISO can resolve tricky validation errors.
### Contacting Microsoft Support
If you've exhausted all the typical troubleshooting steps without any luck, your best option may be to contact Microsoft Support directly. Their technicians have specialized tools and knowledge that can help narrow down the root cause in complex cases. Microsoft support representatives are trained to properly diagnose and resolve the "not valid" error message when resetting Windows 8.1.
In summary, carefully checking your Windows installation media, hardware, product key, and BIOS settings are good places to start with the "not valid" error. Recreating clean installation media from official Microsoft Windows 8.1 ISO files should fix most cases. But Microsoft support is there as a last resort if needed to resolve stubborn validation issues. Back up any important data beforehand in case a refresh or reinstall is required.
