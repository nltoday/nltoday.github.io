## What Does it Mean to be an ARMY?
Being an ARMY means more than just being a casual fan of BTS. As one of the largest and most devoted fandoms in the world, ARMYs have a deep love and respect for each member of BTS. 
### More Than a Casual Fan
While anyone can enjoy the music of BTS, being an official ARMY requires a higher level of commitment and support. [A casual BTS fan](https://fistore.mysenprints.com/collection/albro) may listen to their music occasionally but have limited knowledge about the members and their careers. An ARMY, on the other hand, strives to learn as much about **BTS's complete musical discography, filmography, and personal lives** as possible through official content and avenues that respect the members' privacy.

### Loving All Seven Members
Perhaps the most defining trait of an ARMY is supporting not just individual members but **BTS as a group**. Within the fandom, it's common for ARMYs to have biases or bias wreckers amongst the members, but a true ARMY respects, promotes and defends all seven equally. Solo stanning is seen as against the collaborative spirit of BTS and their music.
## How to Become an Official ARMY Member
While passionate fan behavior alone can certify someone as an unofficial ARMY, the BTS fanclub also offers an official membership program. Here are the key steps to join:
### Register on Weverse 
The main hub for all official BTS and HYBE artist communication is the Weverse application. ARMYs must create a Weverse account to participate in the fanclub. 
### Purchase the Membership During Enrollment Windows
ARMY membership enrollment happens for limited periods, usually every 6-12 months. The sixth round concluded in August 2019. Keep an eye on Weverse announcements for the opening of the **seventh BTS official fanclub membership**.  
### Receive Your Welcome Kit and Member Benefits
Upon purchasing membership, fans will receive a welcome package in the mail containing an exclusive ARMY membership ID card, printed materials, and other gifts. Digital benefits include access to special content and events like fan meetings or concerts. 
### Stay Active on Weverse Community 
The Weverse community brings ARMYs from around the world together. Members can discuss BTS, find fellow fans to support the group with, and be eligible for exclusive **Weverse-based contests and promotions.**
## Perks and Responsibilities of Membership
While online fandom is free and open to all, the ARMY membership amplifies the fan experience through special access. However, it also carries greater expectations of members.
### Exclusive Merchandise and Content  
Top benefits include early access to concert **ticketing, limited edition merchandise bundles** tied to comebacks or tours, and behind-the-scenes **photobooks, DVDs and digital content.** This unmatched content further fuels ARMY passion and devotion.
### Priority in Fan Engagement Opportunities
Official members may gain preferential access to opportunities such as **fan sign events, VLive broadcasts with the group,** direct community involvement and feedback forums. The chance to directly interact inspires immense gratitude and responsibility within ARMYs.  
### Representing BTS and ARMY Honorably
With greater perks comes greater responsibility to **represent the fandom and artists positively.** Official members are ambassadors who uphold the welcoming, respectful ethos of BTS and avoid behaviors like fanwars, overstepping boundaries or disrespecting artist privacy.
## Conclusion: What it Means to Be an Official BTS ARMY Member
From dedicatedly learning about the members to respectfully supporting all seven, the journey to become an official ARMY requires immense love, care and commitment to BTS and their collaborators. While the online fandom is open to all, the official membership amplifies the fan experience through unmatched access, content and opportunities to express gratitude. Most importantly, ARMYs uphold the principles of respect, diversity and joy that BTS promotes globally. This balanced, considerate fanhood is what truly makes one an official BTS ARMY member.
