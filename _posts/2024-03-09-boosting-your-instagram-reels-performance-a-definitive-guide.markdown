### Getting Started with Instagram Reels   
Instagram Reels is a popular feature on the platform that allows users to create and share short multi-clip videos. While Reels can be an effective way to gain new followers and increase engagement, many people struggle to get their videos noticed. In this guide, we'll explore some of the top strategies for boosting your Reels performance and gaining more views.
When you first start creating Reels, it's important to understand how Instagram surfaces content. The platform prioritizes showing Reels to followers who have interacted with your profile in the past. This means you may not see significant reach right away if you don't have an established audience. Be patient and focus on creating fun, [entertaining videos](https://store.fi.io.vn/collection/bulldog) that your current followers will enjoy. Over time, you can start seeing wider distribution as more people discover and engage with your Reels.

### Leveraging Hashtags and Sounds 
Hashtags and popular sounds are two powerful ways to tap into broader communities on Instagram beyond just your followers. When including hashtags in your Reels, aim for terms that are **"discovery hashtags"** rather than ones focused on a single topic or event. General hashtags like #instareels, #reelsinstagram, and #reelit tend to receive a lot of exposure. You can also research trending topics by viewing top Reels hashtags. Remember to only use 2-5 relevant hashtags so you don't overwhelm viewers. 
Sounds are a unique way to engage the Instagram audience since tapping the sound allows people to easily find related videos. Popular sounds offer a big opportunity for exposure, so pay attention to trending audio on the platform. You can also create your own sounds by recording original audio or sampling from songs. Clearing copyright is important, so be mindful of sourcing audio legally. Both sounds and hashtags can help surface your Reels to a much broader potential audience beyond your followers.
### Optimizing for the Reels Feed
While engagement from your existing followers is important, one of the biggest opportunities with Reels is reaching new viewers browsing the dedicated Reels feed. To get featured on this feed, it's crucial to optimize the format and style of your videos. 
Keep Reels short - between 15-30 seconds is generally best. Longer videos may get skipped over more readily. Use attractive titles, stickers, and text to capture attention. Make sure videos are vertical/full-screen format and prioritize landscape mode for maximum views. Consistency with trends like certain audio, hashtags, or styles can also boost chances of algorithmic placement in the broader feed. Overall remember that you're competing for limited real estate, so focus on visually pleasing, highly shareable Reels that viewers want to pass along to friends.
### Improving Video Quality and Storytelling 
High production value attracts more eyeballs on Instagram. **Professional-quality videos** that are well-lit, stable, and in-focus will simply perform better than shaky, poorly composed Reels. Experiment with different creative angles, transitions, and effects. Pay attention to details like a coherent storyline, energetic transitions between clips, and catchy openings/closings. Strong storytelling helps hold viewer attention and increases likelihood they'll share your Reel further. Music, creative text overlays, and stylistic themes/branding can also elevate consistency and quality of your video series over time. Narration, humor, and emotive qualities make Reels more engaging too. Prioritize video excellence for top results.
### Optimizing Shareability and Engagement
While discovery and reach are important, the ultimate goal is getting more followers who truly engage with your brand. To facilitate sharing, make sure Reels ends on a cliffhanger, question, or "Call to Action" like tapping your username or profile. Design Reels specifically with the share button in mind by focusing content that friends might also want to see or relate to. This boosts vital metrics like save and share rates that fuel social proof and greater reach/follows over time. Actively engage with viewer comments, ask questions, and create polls or captions encouraging discussion as a natural lead-in to more shares. Quality engagement is the secret sauce for Reels performance.
### Tracking Analytics for Improvement 
While likes, comments, and saves are nice validation, the real metrics that matter most for any social media business are Follows Gained and Total Account Reach. Instagram Insights provide vital performance indicators to see what's truly working at attracting new followers through Reels. Pay close attention to your View Rate which reflects how frequently videos are played till completion - a key sign of truly engaging Reels. Regularly analyze your best and worst performing Reels to optimize styles, hashtags, sounds and more. Refine over time based on measurable analytics rather than assumptions alone. Successful Instagrammers evolve their strategies constantly according to real data.
### Conclusion
Instagram Reels takes effort but has huge potential for account growth when done correctly. With a focus on discovery tools like relevant hashtags and trending sounds, optimized format/style for maximum visibility, shareable and engaging storytelling, improving production quality, and data-driven evaluation, you can reliably boost Reels views in pursuit of new followers, customers and social media success. Commit to the process of continual refinement based on measurable insights. Consistency and hustle will generate results over time.
