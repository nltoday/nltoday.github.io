### The Recommendations from Experts
Swaddling is a useful technique to help soothe babies and aid sleep, but experts recommend stopping once babies begin to roll over on their own. The [American Academy of Pediatrics](https://store.fi.io.vn/french-bulldog-frenchie-dog-black-dog-lover-frenchies-1) advises parents to stop swaddling as soon as signs of rolling emerge, typically between 2 to 3 months of age. Once a baby shows the ability to roll from front to back or back to front, continuing to swaddle increases the risk of suffocation or sudden infant death syndrome (**SIDS**). It's essential to transition to alternative sleepwear that doesn't restrict arm movement once rolling starts.

### Signs Your Baby is Ready to Roll  
Some clear signs that signal your baby may be ready to roll include attempting to lift their chest and rocking from side to side when lying on their belly. Lots of practice wriggling and shifting weight side to side when held in different positions are excellent indicators of an impending roll. Other signs are when babies suddenly seem discontented while swaddled and arch their back unhappily. Paying close attention to subtle cues from your baby helps determine when rolling is imminent and it's time to stop swaddling before they learn to roll fully. 
### Safe Alternatives to the Swaddle
When signs of rolling emerge, sleep sacks make ideal swaddle substitutes. Choose versatile zip-up styles that allow for easy nighttime changes without full disruption. Adjustable panels help regulate temperature as needed. Lightweight blankets also work well tucked just under the arms. Wearable blankets, affectionately called "swaddle pods" or "woolino sleep sacks", provide warmth and security without limiting arm movement. It's essential to find an alternative that keeps babies cozy without increasing **SIDS** risk like continued swaddling would.
### The Dangers of Swaddling Too Long
Prolonged swaddling poses distinct hazards as it restricts a baby's natural startle reflex once rolling begins. When they experience a frightening stimulus like a loud noise, swaddled babies are unable to use their arms to rock or turn themselves to better cope. This increases **SIDS** risk if they get wedged or cannot maneuver freely. Swaddling also does not allow self-soothing techniques like thumbsucking or hair-grasping through continued use past the rolling stage. It's absolutely vital to transition at the first signs of rolling to avoid jeopardizing safety. Even if rolling has not fully manifested yet, indicators suggest it's imminent and swaddling should cease at that point. 
### Listen to Baby's Cues and Adapt
Rather than relying solely on arbitrary age cut-offs, paying close attention to babies and how each develops uniquely is wisest for the swaddle transition. Some roll earlier than average, others later. The surest sign it's time to stop is when babies act frustrated in swaddles and obviously try rolling motions. Adapt swaddle use flexibly based on infant cues rather than rigid guidelines alone. **Trust your instincts** - if swaddling seems too restrictive for baby's active stage, it's time for a change even if rolling has not fully started. Safety should always be the top priority in caring decisions.
### Benefits of the Swaddle and When to Use
When used correctly up until rolling signs emerge, swaddling provides remarkable benefits to newborns. It mimics the secure feel of the womb and signals sleep cues through gentle pressure. This helps settle fussy babies and aids longer sleep stretches. Swaddling also maintains infant's preferred sleeping position on their back, helping reduce **SIDS** risk itself when used properly. It's perfectly acceptable to continue through the first few months as long as rolling has not commenced. However, safety must take precedence the moment babies are ready to roll. Adapting care promptly then optimizes wellbeing. 
### A Change Made with Baby's Needs in Mind
Transitioning away from swaddling as rolling capabilities develop demonstrates prioritizing an infant's changing needs above rigid protocols. With rolling, babies enter a new stage of motor development requiring freedom of movement. Continued swaddling could impede their natural progression by restricting exploration and self-soothing. A thoughtful change guided by watching for subtle rolling cues, rather than dismissing them, respects where babies are developmentally. It protects them from hazards swaddling may now pose. With flexible sensitivity to each baby's uniqueness, their safety and comfort remain the top priorities.
