Over the past decade, Roblox has grown into one of the most popular gaming platforms and game development tools in the world. With Roblox Studio, anyone can learn how to build 3D worlds, code interactive experiences, and publish games for the Roblox community to enjoy. This guide will help new creators get started with the basics of Roblox Studio.
### Downloading and Installing Roblox Studio
Roblox Studio is available for Windows and macOS and can be downloaded for free from the Roblox website. Before installing, check that your computer meets the minimum system requirements. Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup. During installation, plugins may be offered for additional features - exercise caution when selecting optional third-party plugins. Keep Roblox Studio up to date by checking for updates regularly.

### Understanding the Studio Interface
When Roblox Studio opens, you'll see the main interface divided into different panels. The [3D Viewport](https://store.fi.io.vn/game-controller-christmas-for-video-gamers-boys-kids-455/men&) shows your game world from different views like Top Down or First Person. The **Toolbox** contains all the building tools like Move, Rotate and Scale. The **Game Explorer** lists all the in-game **objects** and **scripts** in a tree view. Taking time to understand each panel will help navigate Studio effectively.
### Building Your First Model 
Let's start by building a simple house model. In the Toolbox, select the **Block** tool. Then in the 3D Viewport, left click and drag to create 3D blocks. Arrange the blocks into a square floor and walls. For the roof, select blocks and rotate them 45 degrees with R key before placing. You can adjust the block size using the Properties panel. When done, **select all parts** using CTRL + left click and **save the model** by right clicking in the Game Explorer and choosing 'Save to Roblox'.
### Adding Basic Functionality
Models are static unless coded with behaviors and interactivity. Let's add a basic script to demonstrate this. In the Toolbox, click Script to open the Script Editor. Add code using the scripting language Lua to make the model change color on a timer. Paste the code, save and test. You've now added dynamic functionality to customize player experiences. As your skills grow, more complex scripts can unlock endless possibilities.
### Publishing and Sharing Your Game
After developing your game with models, scripts and other elements, it's time to publish and share your work. Click 'Save Game As' in the top toolbar to add a title and thumbnail image. Then click 'Publish to Roblox' and your game will be viewable by others on the platform. From there, you can continue improving your game by soliciting feedback, fixing bugs and adding new features over time.
### Learning from the Roblox Community
While exploring Roblox Studio's features is ideal to get started, leveraging learning resources will help accelerate your skills. Browse the Developer Forum to find tutorials, ask questions, and get help from other creators. YouTube is also filled with step-by-step Roblox Studio guide videos. Consider joining DevForum groups focused on specific topics like modeling, scripting, or game design. Participating and collaborating with the community will open doors to constant learning and growth.
### Monetizing Your Roblox Games
For dedicated developers aiming to earn revenue, Roblox provides ways to monetize successful titles. Features like game Passes allow selling exclusive in-game items and upgrades. Ads can be enabled to earn additional income from players. As games garner robust player bases and engagement, applying for programmes under DevEx can lead to hundreds or thousands earned each month. Of course, building a large following takes significant effort - but following best practices and innovating constantly improves chances of standing out.
