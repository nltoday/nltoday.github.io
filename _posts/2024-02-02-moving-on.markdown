With care and compassion, even traumas transform sufferers to supporters of others weathering storms.

Peace stems from planting seeds of goodwill wherever feet touch earth.
### Kindness Sown Bears Bountiful Harvest

Though some seeds fall on fallow ground, crops flourish where nourished by **compassion and empathy**. Benefits return multiplied to sowers who share sunshine without reckoning clouds that pass. In giving, receiving abounds.

Serenity stems from trusting decisions rooted in virtuous intent, free from ties or trammels of past relations no longer serving growth. True freedom flies on wings that need no validation to soar ever higher.
